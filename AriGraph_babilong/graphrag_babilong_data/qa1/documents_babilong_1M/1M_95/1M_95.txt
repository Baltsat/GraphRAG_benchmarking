The cheer was extraordinary, each
Knight having forty dishes to his mess, piled up five or six high; the
room hung with the richest tapestry.Visited again the Duke of Newcastle, with whom I had
been acquainted long before in France, where the Duchess had obligation
to my wife's mother for her marriage there; she was sister to Lord
Lucas, and maid of honor then to the Queen-Mother; married in our chapel
at Paris.My wife being with me, the Duke and Duchess both would needs
bring her to the very Court.My Lord Chancellor showed me all his newly finished
and furnished palace and library; then, we went to take the air in
Hyde-Park.I had a great deal of discourse with his Majesty at
dinner.In the afternoon, I went again with my wife to the Duchess of
Newcastle, who received her in a kind of transport, suitable to her
extravagant humor and dress, which was very singular.Made up accounts with our Receiver, which amounted to
L33,936 1s.Dined at Lord Cornbury's, with Don Francisco de Melos,
Portugal Ambassador, and kindred to the Queen: Of the party were Mr.Henry Jermyn and Sir Henry Capel.Afterward I went to Arundel House, to
salute Mr.Howard's sons, newly returned out of France.[Sidenote: LONDON]

11th May, 1667.To London; dined with the Duke of Newcastle, and sat
discoursing with her Grace in her bedchamber after dinner, till my Lord
Marquis of Dorchester, with other company came in, when I went away.To London, to wait on the Duchess of Newcastle (who was
a mighty pretender to learning, poetry, and philosophy, and had in both
published divers books) to the Royal Society, whither she came in great
pomp, and being received by our Lord President at the door of our
meeting-room, the mace, etc., carried before him, had several
experiments shown to her.I conducted her Grace to her coach, and
returned home.I went to Greenwich, where his Majesty was trying divers
grenadoes shot out of cannon at the Castlehill, from the house in the
park; they broke not till they hit the mark, the forged ones broke not
at all, but the cast ones very well.At the same time, a ring was shown to the King, pretended to be
a projection of mercury, and malleable, and said by the gentlemen to be
fixed by the juice of a plant.To London, alarmed by the Dutch, who were fallen on our
fleet at Chatham, by a most audacious enterprise, entering the very
river with part of their fleet, doing us not only disgrace, but
incredible mischief in burning several of our best men-of-war lying at
anchor and moored there, and all this through our unaccountable
negligence in not setting out our fleet in due time.This alarm caused
me, fearing the enemy might venture up the Thames even to London (which
they might have done with ease, and fired all the vessels in the river,
too), to send away my best goods, plate, etc., from my house to another
place.The alarm was so great that it put both country and city into
fear, panic, and consternation, such as I hope I shall never see more;
everybody was flying, none knew why or whither.Now, there were land
forces dispatched with the Duke of Albemarle, Lord Middleton, Prince
Rupert, and the Duke, to hinder the Dutch coming to Chatham, fortifying
Upnor Castle, and laying chains and bombs; but the resolute enemy broke
through all, and set fire on our ships, and retreated in spite, stopping
up the Thames, the rest of the fleet lying before the mouth of it.I went to see the work at Woolwich, a battery to
prevent them coming up to London, which Prince Rupert commanded, and
sunk some ships in the river.This night, about two o'clock, some chips and
combustible matter prepared for some fire-ships, taking flame in
Deptford-yard, made such a blaze, and caused such an uproar in the Tower
(it being given out that the Dutch fleet was come up, and had landed
their men and fired the Tower), as had liked to have done more mischief
before people would be persuaded to the contrary and believe the
accident.The Dutch fleet still continuing to stop up the river,
so as nothing could stir out or come in, I was before the Council, and
commanded by his Majesty to go with some others and search about the
environs of the city, now exceedingly distressed for want of fuel,
whether there could be any peat, or turf, found fit for use.The next
day, I went and discovered enough, and made my report that there might
be found a great deal; but nothing further was done in it.[Sidenote: CHATHAM]

28th June, 1667.I went to Chatham, and thence to view not only what
mischief the Dutch had done; but how triumphantly their whole fleet lay
within the very mouth of the Thames, all from the North Foreland,
Margate, even to the buoy of the Nore--a dreadful spectacle as ever
Englishmen saw, and a dishonor never to be wiped off!Those who advised
his Majesty to prepare no fleet this spring deserved--I know
what--but[11]--

    [Footnote 11: "The Parliament giving but weak supplies for the war,
    the King, to save charges, is persuaded by the Chancellor, the Lord
    Treasurer, Southampton, the Duke of Albemarle, and the other
    ministers, to lay up the first and second-rate ships, and make only
    a defensive war in the next campaign.The Duke of York opposed this,
    but was overruled."Here in the river off Chatham, just before the town, lay the carcase of
the "London" (now the third time burnt), the "Royal Oak," the "James,"
etc., yet smoking; and now, when the mischief was done, we were making
trifling forts on the brink of the river.Here were yet forces, both of
horse and foot, with General Middleton continually expecting the motions
of the enemy's fleet.I had much discourse with him, who was an
experienced commander, I told him I wondered the King did not fortify
Sheerness[12] and the Ferry; both abandoned.Called upon my Lord Arlington, as from his Majesty, about
the new fuel.The occasion why I was mentioned, was from what I said in
my _Sylva_ three years before, about a sort of fuel for a need, which
obstructed a patent of Lord Carlingford, who had been seeking for it
himself; he was endeavoring to bring me into the project, and proffered
me a share.I met my Lord; and, on the 9th, by an order of Council, went
to my Lord Mayor, to be assisting.In the meantime they had made an
experiment of my receipt of _houllies_, which I mention in my book to be
made at Maestricht, with a mixture of charcoal dust and loam, and which
was tried with success at Gresham College (then being the exchange for
the meeting of the merchants since the fire) for everybody to see.This
done, I went to the Treasury for L12,000 for the sick and wounded yet on
my hands.Next day, we met again about the fuel at Sir J. Armourer's in the Mews.My Lord Brereton and others dined at my house, where I
showed them proof of my new fuel, which was very glowing, and without
smoke or ill smell.I went to see Sir Samuel Morland's inventions and
machines, arithmetical wheels, quench-fires, and new harp.The master of the mint and his lady, Mr.Williamson,
Sir Nicholas Armourer, Sir Edward Bowyer, Sir Anthony Auger, and other
friends dined with me.I went to Gravesend; the Dutch fleet still at anchor
before the river, where I saw five of his Majesty's men-at-war encounter
above twenty of the Dutch, in the bottom of the Hope, chasing them with
many broadsides given and returned toward the buoy of the Nore, where
the body of their fleet lay, which lasted till about midnight.One of
their ships was fired, supposed by themselves, she being run on ground.Having seen this bold action, and their braving us so far up the river,
I went home the next day, not without indignation at our negligence, and
the nation's reproach.It is well known who of the Commissioners of the
Treasury gave advice that the charge of setting forth a fleet this year
might be spared, Sir W. C.I received the sad news of Abraham Cowley's death,
that incomparable poet and virtuous man, my very dear friend, and was
greatly deplored.[Sidenote: LONDON]

3d August, 1667.Cowley's funeral, whose corpse lay at
Wallingford House, and was thence conveyed to Westminster Abbey in a
hearse with six horses and all funeral decency, near a hundred coaches
of noblemen and persons of quality following; among these, all the wits
of the town, divers bishops and clergymen.He was interred next Geoffry
Chaucer, and near Spenser.A goodly monument is since erected to his
memory.Now did his Majesty again dine in the presence, in ancient state, with
music and all the court ceremonies, which had been interrupted since the
late war.Oldenburg, a close prisoner in the Tower,
being suspected of writing intelligence.I had an order from Lord
Arlington, Secretary of State, which caused me to be admitted.This
gentleman was secretary to our Society, and I am confident will prove an
innocent person.Finished my account, amounting to L25,000.Farringdon, a relation of my
wife's.There was now a very gallant horse to be baited to death with dogs; but
he fought them all, so as the fiercest of them could not fasten on him,
till the men run him through with their swords.This wicked and
barbarous sport deserved to have been punished in the cruel contrivers
to get money, under pretense that the horse had killed a man, which was
false.I would not be persuaded to be a spectator.Saw the famous Italian puppet-play, for it was no
other.I was appointed, with the rest of my brother
commissioners, to put in execution an order of Council for freeing the
prisoners at war in my custody at Leeds Castle, and taking off his
Majesty's extraordinary charge, having called before us the French and
Dutch agents.The peace was now proclaimed, in the usual form, by the
heralds-at-arms.After evening service, I went to visit Mr.Vaughan,
who lay at Greenwich, a very wise and learned person, one of Mr.Selden's executors and intimate friends.Visited the Lord Chancellor, to whom his Majesty had
sent for the seals a few days before; I found him in his bedchamber,
very sad.The Parliament had accused him, and he had enemies at Court,
especially the buffoons and ladies of pleasure, because he thwarted some
of them, and stood in their way; I could name some of the chief.The
truth is, he made few friends during his grandeur among the royal
sufferers, but advanced the old rebels.He was, however, though no
considerable lawyer, one who kept up the form and substance of things in
the Nation with more solemnity than some would have had.He was my
particular kind friend, on all occasions.The cabal, however, prevailed,
and that party in Parliament.Great division at Court concerning him,
and divers great persons interceding for him.I dined with my late Lord Chancellor, where also
dined Mr.W. Legge, of the bedchamber; his Lordship
pretty well in heart, though now many of his friends and sycophants
abandoned him.In the afternoon, to the Lords Commissioners for money, and thence to
the audience of a Russian Envoy in the Queen's presence-chamber,
introduced with much state, the soldiers, pensioners, and guards in
their order.His letters of credence brought by his secretary in a scarf
of sarsenet, their vests sumptuous, much embroidered with pearls.He
delivered his speech in the Russ language, but without the least action,
or motion, of his body, which was immediately interpreted aloud by a
German that spoke good English: half of it consisted in repetition of
the Czar's titles, which were very haughty and oriental: the substance
of the rest was, that he was only sent to see the King and Queen, and
know how they did, with much compliment and frothy language.Then, they
kissed their Majesties' hands, and went as they came; but their real
errand was to get money.We met at the Star-chamber about exchange and release
of prisoners.Came Sir John Kiviet, to article with me about his
brickwork.Between the hours of twelve and one, was born my
second daughter, who was afterward christened Elizabeth.[Sidenote: LONDON]

19th September, 1667.Henry Howard, of Norfolk, of
whom I obtained the gift of his Arundelian marbles, those celebrated and
famous inscriptions, Greek and Latin, gathered with so much cost and
industry from Greece, by his illustrious grandfather, the magnificent
Earl of Arundel, my noble friend while he lived.When I saw these
precious monuments miserably neglected, and scattered up and down about
the garden, and other parts of Arundel House, and how exceedingly the
corrosive air of London impaired them, I procured him to bestow them on
the University of Oxford.This he was pleased to grant me; and now gave
me the key of the gallery, with leave to mark all those stones, urns,
altars, etc., and whatever I found had inscriptions on them, that were
not statues.This I did; and getting them removed and piled together,
with those which were incrusted in the garden walls, I sent immediately
letters to the Vice-Chancellor of what I had procured, and that if they
esteemed it a service to the University (of which I had been a member),
they should take order for their transportation.Howard to his villa at Albury, where I
designed for him the plot of his canal and garden, with a crypt through
the hill.Returned to London, where I had orders to deliver
the possession of Chelsea College (used as my prison during the war with
Holland for such as were sent from the fleet to London) to our Society,
as a gift of his Majesty, our founder.Bathurst, Dean of Wells,
President of Trinity College, sent by the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, in
the name both of him and the whole University, to thank me for procuring
the inscriptions, and to receive my directions what was to be done to
show their gratitude to Mr.I went to see Lord Clarendon, late Lord Chancellor
and greatest officer in England, in continual apprehension what the
Parliament would determine concerning him.Barlow, Provost of Queen's College and
Protobibliothecus of the Bodleian library, to take order about the
transportation of the marbles.There were delivered to me two letters from the
Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, with the Decree of the Convocation, attested
by the Public Notary, ordering four Doctors of Divinity and Law to
acknowledge the obligation the University had to me for procuring the
_Marmora Arundeliana_, which was solemnly done by Dr.Jenkins, Judge of the Admiralty, Dr.Lloyd, and Obadiah Walker, of
University College, who having made a large compliment from the
University, delivered me the decree fairly written;

    _Gesta venerabili domo Convocationis Universitatis Oxon.Quo die retulit ad Senatum Academicum Dominus
    Vicecancellarius, quantum Universitas deberet singulari benevolentiae

    "SIR:

    "We intend also a noble inscription, in which also honorable mention
    shall be made of yourself; but Mr.Vice-Chancellor commands me to
    tell you that that was not sufficient for your merits; but, that if
    your occasions would permit you to come down at the Act (when we
    intend a dedication of our new Theater), some other testimony should
    be given both of your own worth and affection to this your old
    mother; for we are all very sensible that this great addition of
    learning and reputation to the University is due as well to your
    industrious care for the University, and interest with my Lord
    Howard, as to his great nobleness and generosity of spirit."I am, Sir, your most humble servant,

    "OBADIAH WALKER, Univ.The Vice-Chancellor's letter to the same effect was too vainglorious to
insert, with divers copies of verses that were also sent me.Their
mentioning me in the inscription I totally declined, when I directed the
titles of Mr.Howard, now made Lord, upon his Ambassage to Morocco.These four doctors, having made me this compliment, desired me to carry
and introduce them to Mr.Howard, at Arundel House; which I did, Dr.Barlow (Provost of Queen's) after a short speech, delivering a larger
letter of the University's thanks, which was written in Latin,
expressing the great sense they had of the honor done them.After this
compliment handsomely performed and as nobly received, Mr.Seymour
in the House of Commons; and, in the evening, I returned home.My birthday--blessed be God for all his mercies!I
made the Royal Society a present of the Table of Veins, Arteries, and
Nerves, which great curiosity I had caused to be made in Italy, out of
the natural human bodies, by a learned physician, and the help of
Veslingius (professor at Padua), from whence I brought them in 1646.For
this I received the public thanks of the Society; and they are hanging
up in their repository with an inscription.[13] I found him
in his garden at his new-built palace, sitting in his gout wheel-chair,
and seeing the gates setting up toward the north and the fields.He
looked and spake very disconsolately.After some while deploring his
condition to me, I took my leave.Next morning, I heard he was gone;
though I am persuaded that, had he gone sooner, though but to Cornbury,
and there lain quiet, it would have satisfied the Parliament.That which
exasperated them was his presuming to stay and contest the accusation as
long as it was possible: and they were on the point of sending him to
the Tower.[Footnote 13: This entry of the 9th December, 1667, is a mistake.Evelyn could not have visited the "late Lord Chancellor" on that
    day.Lord Clarendon fled on Saturday, the 29th of November, 1667,
    and his letter resigning the Chancellorship of the University of
    Oxford is dated from Calais on the 7th of December.That Evelyn's
    book is not, in every respect, strictly a diary, is shown by this
    and several similar passages already adverted to in the remarks
    prefixed to the present edition.If the entry of the 18th of August,
    1683, is correct, the date of Evelyn's last visit to Lord Clarendon
    was the 28th of November, 1667.]Heath, wife of my
worthy friend and schoolfellow.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st December, 1667.I saw one Carr pilloried at Charing-cross for a
libel, which was burnt before him by the hangman.I saw deep and prodigious gaming at the
Groom-Porter's, vast heaps of gold squandered away in a vain and profuse
manner.This I looked on as a horrid vice, and unsuitable in a Christian
Court.Went to see the revels at the Middle Temple, which is
also an old riotous custom, and has relation neither to virtue nor
policy.Povey, where were divers great Lords to
see his well-contrived cellar, and other elegancies.We went to stake out ground for building a college
for the Royal Society at Arundel-House, but did not finish it, which we
shall repent of.I saw the tragedy of "Horace" (written by the
VIRTUOUS Mrs.Philips) acted before their Majesties.Between each act a
masque and antique dance.The excessive gallantry of the ladies was
infinite, those especially on that... Castlemaine, esteemed at L40,000
and more, far outshining the Queen.I saw the audience of the Swedish Ambassador Count
Donna, in great state in the banqueting house.Was launched at Deptford, that goodly vessel, "The
Charles."She is longer than the "Sovereign,"
and carries 110 brass cannon; she was built by old Shish, a plain,
honest carpenter, master-builder of this dock, but one who can give very
little account of his art by discourse, and is hardly capable of
reading, yet of great ability in his calling.The family have been ship
carpenters in this yard above 300 years.Went to visit Sir John Cotton, who had me into his
library, full of good MSS., Greek and Latin, but most famous for those
of the Saxon and English antiquities, collected by his grandfather.To the Royal Society, where I subscribed 50,000 bricks,
toward building a college.Among other libertine libels, there was one
now printed and thrown about, a bold petition of the poor w----s to Lady
Castlemaine.[14]

    [Footnote 14: Evelyn has been supposed himself to have written this
    piece.][Sidenote: LONDON]

9th April, 1668.To London, about finishing my grand account of the sick
and wounded, and prisoners at war, amounting to above L34,000.I heard Sir R. Howard impeach Sir William Penn, in the House of Lords,
for breaking bulk, and taking away rich goods out of the East India
prizes, formerly taken by Lord Sandwich.To London, about the purchase of Ravensbourne Mills,
and land around it, in Upper Deptford, of one Mr.We sealed the deeds in Sir Edward Thurland's chambers
in the Inner Temple.I pray God bless it to me, it being a dear
pennyworth; but the passion Sir R. Browne had for it, and that it was
contiguous to our other grounds, engaged me!Invited by that expert commander, Captain Cox, master of
the lately built "Charles II.," now the best vessel of the fleet,
designed for the Duke of York, I went to Erith, where we had a great
dinner.Sir Richard Edgecombe, of Mount Edgecombe, by Plymouth,
my relation, came to visit me; a very virtuous and worthy gentleman.To a new play with several of my relations, "The
Evening Lover," a foolish plot, and very profane; it afflicted me to see
how the stage was degenerated and polluted by the licentious times.Sir Samuel Tuke, Bart., and the lady he had married this
day, came and bedded at night at my house, many friends accompanying the
bride.At the Royal Society, were presented divers _glossa
petras_, and other natural curiosities, found in digging to build the
fort at Sheerness.They were just the same as they bring from Malta,
pretending them to be viper's teeth, whereas, in truth, they are of a
shark, as we found by comparing them with one in our repository.), my old
fellow-traveler, now reader at the Middle Temple, invited me to his
feast, which was so very extravagant and great as the like had not been
seen at any time.There were the Duke of Ormond, Privy Seal, Bedford,
Belasis, Halifax, and a world more of Earls and Lords.His Majesty was pleased to grant me a lease of a slip
of ground out of Brick Close, to enlarge my fore-court, for which I now
gave him thanks; then, entering into other discourse, he talked to me of
a new varnish for ships, instead of pitch, and of the gilding with which
his new yacht was beautified.I showed his Majesty the perpetual motion
sent to me by Dr.Stokes, from Cologne; and then came in Monsieur
Colbert, the French Ambassador.I saw the magnificent entry of the French Ambassador
Colbert, received in the banqueting house.I had never seen a richer
coach than that which he came in to Whitehall.Standing by his Majesty
at dinner in the presence, there was of that rare fruit called the
king-pine, growing in Barbadoes and the West Indies; the first of them I
had ever seen.His Majesty having cut it up, was pleased to give me a
piece off his own plate to taste of; but, in my opinion, it falls short
of those ravishing varieties of deliciousness described in Captain
Ligon's history, and others; but possibly it might, or certainly was,
much impaired in coming so far; it has yet a grateful acidity, but
tastes more like the quince and melon than of any other fruit he
mentions.Published my book on "The Perfection of Painting,"
dedicated to Mr.I entertained Signor Muccinigo, the Venetian
Ambassador, of one of the noblest families of the State, this being the
day of making his public entry, setting forth from my house with several
gentlemen of Venice and others in a very glorious train.He staid with
me till the Earl of Anglesea and Sir Charles Cotterell (master of the
ceremonies) came with the King's barge to carry him to the Tower, where
the guns were fired at his landing; he then entered his Majesty's coach,
followed by many others of the nobility.I accompanied him to his house,
where there was a most noble supper to all the company, of course.After
the extraordinary compliments to me and my wife, for the civilities he
received at my house, I took leave and returned.He is a very
accomplished person.I had much discourse with Signor Pietro Cisij, a
Persian gentleman, about the affairs of Turkey, to my great
satisfaction.I went to see Sir Elias Leighton's project of a cart with
iron axletrees.Being at dinner, my sister Evelyn sent for me to
come up to London to my continuing sick brother.[Sidenote: LONDON]

14th November, 1668.To London, invited to the consecration of that
excellent person, the Dean of Ripon, Dr.Wilkins, now made Bishop of
Chester; it was at Ely House, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr.Cosin,
Bishop of Durham, the Bishops of Ely, Salisbury, Rochester, and others
officiating.Then, we went to a sumptuous dinner
in the hall, where were the Duke of Buckingham, Judges, Secretaries of
State, Lord-Keeper, Council, Noblemen, and innumerable other company,
who were honorers of this incomparable man, universally beloved by all
who knew him.This being the Queen's birthday, great was the gallantry at Whitehall,
and the night celebrated with very fine fireworks.My poor brother continuing ill, I went not from him till the 17th, when,
dining at the Groom Porters, I heard Sir Edward Sutton play excellently
on the Irish harp; he performs genteelly, but not approaching my worthy
friend, Mr.Clark, a gentleman of Northumberland, who makes it execute
lute, viol, and all the harmony an instrument is capable of; pity it is
that it is not more in use; but, indeed, to play well, takes up the
whole man, as Mr.Clark has assured me, who, though a gentleman of
quality and parts, was yet brought up to that instrument from five years
old, as I remember he told me.I waited on Lord Sandwich, who presented me with a
Sembrador he brought out of Spain, showing me his two books of
observations made during his embassy and stay at Madrid, in which were
several rare things he promised to impart to me.I dined at my Lord Ashley's (since Earl of
Shaftesbury), when the match of my niece was proposed for his only son,
in which my assistance was desired for my Lord.Patrick preached at Convent Garden, on Acts
xvii.31, the certainty of Christ's coming to judgment, it being Advent;
a most suitable discourse.I went to see the old play of "Cataline" acted,
having been now forgotten almost forty years.I dined with my Lord Cornbury, at Clarendon House,
now bravely furnished, especially with the pictures of most of our
ancient and modern wits, poets, philosophers, famous and learned
Englishmen; which collection of the Chancellor's I much commended, and
gave his Lordship a catalogue of more to be added.I entertained my kind neighbors, according to
custom, giving Almighty God thanks for his gracious mercies to me the
past year.Imploring his blessing for the year entering, I went
to church, where our Doctor preached on Psalm lxv.12, apposite to the
season, and beginning a new year.About this time one of Sir William Penn's sons had
published a blasphemous book against the Deity of our Blessed Lord.I went to see a tall gigantic woman who measured 6
feet 10 inches high, at 21 years old, born in the Low Countries.I presented his Majesty with my "History of the
Four Impostors;"[15] he told me of other like cheats.I gave my book to
Lord Arlington, to whom I dedicated it.It was now that he began to
tempt me about writing "The Dutch War."[Footnote 15: Reprinted in Evelyn's "Miscellaneous Writings."]Phillips' "Horace" acted again.To the Royal Society, when Signor Malpighi, an
Italian physician and anatomist, sent this learned body the incomparable
"History of the Silk-worm."Dined at Lord Arlington's at Goring House, with the
Bishop of Hereford.To the Council of the Royal Society, about disposing
my Lord Howard's library, now given to us.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th March, 1669.Christopher Wase about my Lord
Arlington.I went with Lord Howard of Norfolk, to visit Sir
William Ducie at Charlton, where we dined; the servants made our
coachmen so drunk, that they both fell off their boxes on the heath,
where we were fain to leave them, and were driven to London by two
servants of my Lord's.This barbarous custom of making the masters
welcome by intoxicating the servants, had now the second time happened
to my coachmen.Treasurer's, where was (with many noblemen)
Colonel Titus of the bedchamber, author of the famous piece against
Cromwell, "Killing no Murder."Williamson, Secretary to the Secretary of
State, and Clerk of the Papers.I dined with the Archbishop of Canterbury, at Lambeth,
and saw the library, which was not very considerable.At a Council of the Royal Society our grant was
finished, in which his Majesty gives us Chelsea College, and some land
about it.It was ordered that five should be a quorum for a Council.The
Vice-President was then sworn for the first time, and it was proposed
how we should receive the Prince of Tuscany, who desired to visit the
Society.This evening, at 10 o'clock, was born my third daughter,
who was baptized on the 25th by the name of Susannah.Went to take leave of Lord Howard, going Ambassador to
Morocco.Dined at Lord Arlington's, where were the Earl of Berkshire,
Lord Saint John, Sir Robert Howard, and Sir R. Holmes.Came my Lord Cornbury, Sir William Pulteney, and others
to visit me.I went this evening to London, to carry Mr.Pepys to my
brother Richard, now exceedingly afflicted with the stone, who had been
successfully cut, and carried the stone as big as a tennis ball to show
him, and encourage his resolution to go through the operation.My wife went a journey of pleasure down the river as
far as the sea, with Mrs.Howard and her daughter, the Maid of Honor,
and others, among whom that excellent creature, Mrs.[16]

8th July, 1669.In the morning was celebrated the Encaenia of the New
Theater, so magnificently built by the munificence of Dr.Gilbert
Sheldon, Archbishop of Canterbury, in which was spent,L25,000, as Sir
Christopher Wren, the architect (as I remember), told me; and yet it was
never seen by the benefactor, my Lord Archbishop having told me that he
never did or ever would see it.It is, in truth, a fabric comparable to
any of this kind of former ages, and doubtless exceeding any of the
present, as this University does for colleges, libraries, schools,
students, and order, all the universities in the world.To the theater
is added the famous Sheldonian printing house.This being at the Act and
the first time of opening the Theater (Acts being formerly kept in St.Mary's Church, which might be thought indecent, that being a place set
apart for the immediate worship of God, and was the inducement for
building this noble pile), it was now resolved to keep the present Act
in it, and celebrate its dedication with the greatest splendor and
formality that might be; and, therefore, drew a world of strangers, and
other company, to the University, from all parts of the nation.The Vice-Chancellor, Heads of Houses, and Doctors, being seated in
magisterial seats, the Vice-Chancellor's chair and desk, Proctors, etc.,
covered with _brocatelle_ (a kind of brocade) and cloth of gold; the
University Registrar read the founder's grant and gift of it to the
University for their scholastic exercises upon these solemn occasions.South, the University's orator, in an eloquent speech,
which was very long, and not without some malicious and indecent
reflections on the Royal Society, as underminers of the University;
which was very foolish and untrue, as well as unseasonable.But, to let
that pass from an ill-natured man, the rest was in praise of the
Archbishop and the ingenious architect.This ended, after loud music
from the corridor above, where an organ was placed, there followed
divers panegyric speeches, both in prose and verse, interchangeably
pronounced by the young students placed in the rostrums, in Pindarics,
Eclogues, Heroics, etc., mingled with excellent music, vocal and
instrumental, to entertain the ladies and the rest of the company.A
speech was then made in praise of academical learning.This lasted from
eleven in the morning till seven at night, which was concluded with
ringing of bells, and universal joy and feasting.The next day began the more solemn lectures in all the
faculties, which were performed in the several schools, where all the
Inceptor-Doctors did their exercises, the Professors having first ended
their reading.The assembly now returned to the Theater, where the
_Terrae filius_ (the _University Buffoon_) entertained the auditory with
a tedious, abusive, sarcastical rhapsody, most unbecoming the gravity of
the University, and that so grossly, that unless it be suppressed, it
will be of ill consequence, as I afterward plainly expressed my sense of
it both to the Vice-Chancellor and several Heads of Houses, who were
perfectly ashamed of it, and resolved to take care of it in future.The
old facetious way of rallying upon the questions was left off, falling
wholly upon persons, so that it was rather licentious lying and railing
than genuine and noble wit.In my life, I was never witness of so
shameful an entertainment.After this ribaldry, the Proctors made their speeches.Then began the
music art, vocal and instrumental, above in the balustrade corridor
opposite to the Vice-Chancellor's seat.Wallis, the
mathematical Professor, made his oration, and created one Doctor of
music according to the usual ceremonies of gown (which was of white
damask), cap, ring, kiss, etc.Next followed the disputations of the
Inceptor-Doctors in Medicine, the speech of their Professor, Dr.Hyde,
and so in course their respective creations.Then disputed the Inceptors
of Law, the speech of their Professor, and creation.Lastly, Inceptors
of Theology: Dr.Compton (brother of the Earl of Northampton) being
junior, began with great modesty and applause; so the rest.Allestree's speech, the
King's Professor, and their respective creations.Last of all, the
Vice-Chancellor, shutting up the whole in a panegyrical oration,
celebrating their benefactor and the rest, apposite to the occasion.Thus was the Theater dedicated by the scholastic exercises in all the
Faculties with great solemnity; and the night, as the former,
entertaining the new Doctor's friends in feasting and music.Barlow, the worthy and learned Professor of Queen's
College.The Act sermon was this forenoon preached by Dr.Mary's, in an honest, practical discourse against atheism.In the
afternoon, the church was so crowded, that, not coming early, I could
not approach to hear.Was held the Divinity Act in the Theater again,
when proceeded seventeen Doctors, in all Faculties some.I dined at the Vice-Chancellor's, and spent the
afternoon in seeing the rarities of the public libraries, and visiting
the noble marbles and inscriptions, now inserted in the walls that
compass the area of the Theater, which were 150 of the most ancient and
worthy treasures of that kind in the learned world.Now, observing that
people approach them too near, some idle persons began to scratch and
injure them, I advised that a hedge of holly should be planted at the
foot of the wall, to be kept breast-high only to protect them; which the
Vice-Chancellor promised to do the next season.Fell, Dean of Christ Church and Vice-Chancellor,
with Dr.Allestree, Professor, with beadles and maces before them, came
to visit me at my lodging.I went to visit Lord Howard's sons at
Magdalen College.Having two days before had notice that the University
intended me the honor of Doctorship, I was this morning attended by the
beadles belonging to the Law, who conducted me to the Theater, where I
found the Duke of Ormond (now Chancellor of the University) with the
Earl of Chesterfield and Mr.Spencer (brother to the late Earl of
Sunderland).Thence, we marched to the Convocation House, a convocation
having been called on purpose; here, being all of us robed in the porch,
in scarlet with caps and hoods, we were led in by the Professor of Laws,
and presented respectively by name, with a short eulogy, to the
Vice-Chancellor, who sat in the chair, with all the Doctors and Heads of
Houses and masters about the room, which was exceedingly full.Then,
began the Public Orator his speech, directed chiefly to the Duke of
Ormond, the Chancellor; but in which I had my compliment, in course.This ended, we were called up, and created Doctors according to the
form, and seated by the Vice-Chancellor among the Doctors, on his right
hand; then, the Vice-Chancellor made a short speech, and so, saluting
our brother Doctors, the pageantry concluded, and the convocation was
dissolved.So formal a creation of honorary Doctors had seldom been
seen, that a convocation should be called on purpose, and speeches made
by the Orator; but they could do no less, their Chancellor being to
receive, or rather do them, this honor.I should have been made Doctor
with the rest at the public Act, but their expectation of their
Chancellor made them defer it.I was then led with my brother Doctors to
an extraordinary entertainment at Doctor Mewes's, head of St.John's
College, and, after abundance of feasting and compliments, having
visited the Vice-Chancellor and other Doctors, and given them thanks for
the honor done me, I went toward home the 16th, and got as far as
Windsor, and so to my house the next day.I was invited by Sir Henry Peckham to his reading
feast in the Middle Temple, a pompous entertainment, where were the
Archbishop of Canterbury, all the great Earls and Lords, etc.I had much
discourse with my Lord Winchelsea, a prodigious talker; and the Venetian
Ambassador.To London, spending almost the entire day in
surveying what progress was made in rebuilding the ruinous city, which
now began a little to revive after its sad calamity.I saw the splendid audience of the Danish Ambassador
in the Banqueting House at Whitehall.I went to visit my most excellent and worthy neighbor,
the Lord Bishop of Rochester, at Bromley, which he was now repairing,
after the delapidations of the late Rebellion.I was this day very ill of a pain in my limbs, which
continued most of this week, and was increased by a visit I made to my
old acquaintance, the Earl of Norwich, at his house in Epping Forest,
where are many good pictures put into the wainscot of the rooms, which
Mr.Baker, his Lordship's predecessor there, brought out of Spain;
especially the History of Joseph, a picture of the pious and learned
Picus Mirandula, and an incomparable one of old Breugel.The gardens
were well understood, I mean the _potager_.I returned late in the
evening, ferrying over the water at Greenwich.To church, to give God thanks for my recovery.I received the Blessed Eucharist, to my unspeakable
joy.To the Royal Society, meeting for the first time
after a long recess, during vacation, according to custom; where was
read a description of the prodigious eruption of Mount Etna; and our
English itinerant presented an account of his autumnal peregrination
about England, for which we hired him, bringing dried fowls, fish,
plants, animals, etc.My dear brother continued extremely full of pain,
the Lord be gracious to him!This being the day of meeting for the poor, we dined
neighborly together.Patrick, on
the Resurrection, and afterward, visited the Countess of Kent, my
kinswoman.To London, upon the second edition of my "Sylva,"
which I presented to the Royal Society.John Breton, Master of Emmanuel College, in
Cambridge (uncle to our vicar), preached on John i.27; "whose
shoe-latchet I am not worthy to unloose," etc., describing the various
fashions of shoes, or sandals, worn by the Jews, and other nations: of
the ornaments of the feet: how great persons had servants that took them
off when they came to their houses, and bore them after them: by which
pointing the dignity of our Savior, when such a person as St.John
Baptist acknowledged his unworthiness even of that mean office.The
lawfulness, decentness, and necessity, of subordinate degrees and ranks
of men and servants, as well in the Church as State: against the late
levelers, and others of that dangerous rabble, who would have all alike.Finding my brother [Richard] in such exceeding torture,
and that he now began to fall into convulsion-fits, I solemnly set the
next day apart to beg of God to mitigate his sufferings, and prosper the
only means which yet remained for his recovery, he being not only much
wasted, but exceedingly and all along averse from being cut (for the
stone); but, when he at last consented, and it came to the operation,
and all things prepared, his spirit and resolution failed.[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th March, 1670.I
participated of the Blessed Sacrament, recommending to God the
deplorable condition of my dear brother, who was almost in the last
agonies of death.It pleased God to
deliver him out of this miserable life, toward five o'clock this Monday
morning, to my unspeakable grief.He was a brother whom I most dearly
loved, for his many virtues; but two years younger than myself, a sober,
prudent, worthy gentleman.He had married a great fortune, and left one
only daughter, and a noble seat at Woodcot, near Epsom.His body was
opened, and a stone taken out of his bladder, not much bigger than a
nutmeg.I returned home on the 8th, full of sadness, and to bemoan my
loss.A stranger preached at the Savoy French church; the
Liturgy of the Church of England being now used altogether, as
translated into French by Dr.We all accompanied the corpse of my dear brother to
Epsom Church, where he was decently interred in the chapel belonging to
Woodcot House.A great number of friends and gentlemen of the country
attended, about twenty coaches and six horses, and innumerable people.I went to Westminster, where in the House of Lords I
saw his Majesty sit on his throne, but without his robes, all the peers
sitting with their hats on; the business of the day being the divorce of
my Lord Ross.Such an occasion and sight had not been seen in England
since the time of Henry VIII.[17]

    [Footnote 17: Evelyn subjoins in a note: "When there was a project,
    1669, for getting a divorce for the King, to facilitate it there was
    brought into the House of Lords a bill for dissolving the marriage
    of Lord Ross, on account of adultery, and to give him leave to marry
    again.This Bill, after great debates, passed by the plurality of
    only two votes, and that by the great industry of the Lord's
    friends, as well as the Duke's enemies, who carried it on chiefly in
    hopes it might be a precedent and inducement for the King to enter
    the more easily into their late proposals; nor were they a little
    encouraged therein, when they saw the King countenance and drive on
    the Bill in Lord Ross's favor.Of eighteen bishops that were in the
    House, only two voted for the bill, of which one voted through age,
    and one was reputed Socinian."The two bishops favorable to the bill
    were Dr.Cosin, Bishop of Durham, and Dr.Wilkins, Bishop of
    Chester.]To London, concerning the office of Latin Secretary to
his Majesty, a place of more honor and dignity than profit, the
reversion of which he had promised me.Henry Saville, and Sir Charles
Scarborough.Philip Howard, Lord Almoner
to the Queen, that Monsieur Evelin, first physician to Madame (who was
now come to Dover to visit the King her brother), was come to town,
greatly desirous to see me; but his stay so short, that he could not
come to me, I went with my brother to meet him at the Tower, where he
was seeing the magazines and other curiosities, having never before been
in England: we renewed our alliance and friendship, with much regret on
both sides that, he being to return toward Dover that evening, we could
not enjoy one another any longer.How this French family, Ivelin, of
Evelin, Normandy, a very ancient and noble house is grafted into our
pedigree, see in the collection brought from Paris, 1650.I went with some friends to the Bear Garden, where was
cock-fighting, dog-fighting, bear and bull-baiting, it being a famous
day for all these butcherly sports, or rather barbarous cruelties.The
bulls did exceedingly well, but the Irish wolf dog exceeded, which was a
tall greyhound, a stately creature indeed, who beat a cruel mastiff.One
of the bulls tossed a dog full into a lady's lap as she sat in one of
the boxes at a considerable height from the arena.Two poor dogs were
killed, and so all ended with the ape on horseback, and I most heartily
weary of the rude and dirty pastime, which I had not seen, I think, in
twenty years before.Dined at Goring House, whither my Lord Arlington
carried me from Whitehall with the Marquis of Worcester; there, we found
Lord Sandwich, Viscount Stafford,[18] the Lieutenant of the Tower, and
others.After dinner, my Lord communicated to me his Majesty's desire
that I would engage to write the history of our late war with the
Hollanders, which I had hitherto declined; this I found was ill taken,
and that I should disoblige his Majesty, who had made choice of me to do
him this service, and, if I would undertake it, I should have all the
assistance the Secretary's office and others could give me, with other
encouragements, which I could not decently refuse.[Footnote 18: Sir William Howard, created in November, 1640,
    Viscount Stafford.In 1678, he was accused of complicity with the
    Popish Plot, and upon trial by his Peers in Westminster Hall, was
    found guilty, by a majority of twenty-four.He was beheaded,
    December 29, 1680, on Tower Hill.]Lord Stafford rose from the table, in some disorder, because there were
roses stuck about the fruit when the dessert was set on the table; such
an antipathy, it seems, he had to them as once Lady Selenger also had,
and to that degree that, as Sir Kenelm Digby tells us, laying but a rose
upon her cheek when she was asleep, it raised a blister: but Sir Kenelm
was a teller of strange things.Came the Earl of Huntington and Countess, with the Lord
Sherard, to visit us.[Sidenote: LONDON]

29th June, 1670.To London, in order to my niece's marriage, Mary,
daughter to my late brother Richard, of Woodcot, with the eldest son of
Mr.Attorney Montague, which was celebrated at Southampton-House chapel,
after which a magnificent entertainment, feast, and dancing, dinner and
supper, in the great room there; but the bride was bedded at my sister's
lodging, in Drury-Lane.Stanhope, gentleman-usher to her
Majesty, and uncle to the Earl of Chesterfield, a very fine man, with my
Lady Hutcheson.I accompanied my worthy friend, that excellent man, Sir
Robert Murray, with Mr.Slingsby, master of the mint, to see the
latter's seat and estate at Burrow-Green in Cambridgeshire, he desiring
our advice for placing a new house, which he was resolved to build.We
set out in a coach and six horses with him and his lady, dined about
midway at one Mr.Turner's, where we found a very noble dinner, venison,
music, and a circle of country ladies and their gallants.After dinner,
we proceeded, and came to Burrow-Green that night.This had been the
ancient seat of the Cheekes (whose daughter Mr.Slingsby married),
formerly tutor to King Henry VI.The old house large and ample, and
built for ancient hospitality, ready to fall down with age, placed in a
dirty hole, a stiff clay, no water, next an adjoining church-yard, and
with other inconveniences.We pitched on a spot of rising ground,
adorned with venerable woods, a dry and sweet prospect east and west,
and fit for a park, but no running water; at a mile distance from the
old house.We went to dine at Lord Allington's, who had newly
built a house of great cost, I believe a little less than L20,000.It is seated in a park, with a sweet prospect
and stately avenue; but water still defective; the house has also its
infirmities.[Sidenote: NEWMARKET]

22d July, 1670.We rode out to see the great mere, or level, of
recovered fen land, not far off.In the way, we met Lord Arlington going
to his house in Suffolk, accompanied with Count Ogniati, the Spanish
minister, and Sir Bernard Gascoigne; he was very importunate with me to
go with him to Euston, being but fifteen miles distant; but, in regard
of my company, I could not.So, passing through Newmarket, we alighted
to see his Majesty's house there, now new-building; the arches of the
cellars beneath are well turned by Mr.Samuel, the architect, the rest
mean enough, and hardly fit for a hunting house.Many of the rooms above
had the chimneys in the angles and corners, a mode now introduced by his
Majesty, which I do at no hand approve of.I predict it will spoil many
noble houses and rooms, if followed.It does only well in very small and
trifling rooms, but takes from the state of greater.Besides, this house
is placed in a dirty street, without any court or avenue, like a common
one, whereas it might and ought to have been built at either end of the
town, upon the very carpet where the sports are celebrated; but, it
being the purchase of an old wretched house of my Lord Thomond's, his
Majesty was persuaded to set it on that foundation, the most improper
imaginable for a house of sport and pleasure.We went to see the stables and fine horses, of which many were here kept
at a vast expense, with all the art and tenderness imaginable.Being arrived at some meres, we found Lord Wotton and Sir John Kiviet
about their draining engines, having, it seems, undertaken to do wonders
on a vast piece of marsh-ground they had hired of Sir Thomas Chicheley
(master of the ordnance).They much pleased themselves with the hopes of
a rich harvest of hemp and coleseed, which was the crop expected.Here we visited the engines and mills both for wind and water, draining
it through two rivers or graffs, cut by hand, and capable of carrying
considerable barges, which went thwart one the other, discharging the
water into the sea.Such this spot had been the former winter; it was
astonishing to see it now dry, and so rich that weeds grew on the banks,
almost as high as a man and horse.Here, my Lord and his partner had
built two or three rooms, with Flanders white bricks, very hard.One of
the great engines was in the kitchen, where I saw the fish swim up, even
to the very chimney hearth, by a small cut through the room, and running
within a foot of the very fire.Having, after dinner, ridden about that vast level, pestered with heat
and swarms of gnats, we returned over Newmarket Heath, the way being
mostly a sweet turf and down, like Salisbury Plain, the jockeys
breathing their fine barbs and racers and giving them their heats.We returned from Burrow Green to London, staying some
time at Audley End to see that fine palace.It is indeed a cheerful
piece of Gothic building, or rather _antico moderno_, but placed in an
obscure bottom.The cellars and galleries are very stately.It has a
river by it, a pretty avenue of limes, and in a park.This is in Saffron Walden parish, famous for that useful plant, with
which all the country is covered.[Sidenote: LONDON]

Dining at Bishop Stortford, we came late to London.There was sent me by a neighbor a servant maid, who,
in the last month, as she was sitting before her mistress at work, felt
a stroke on her arm a little above the wrist for some height, the smart
of which, as if struck by another hand, caused her to hold her arm
awhile till somewhat mitigated; but it put her into a kind of
convulsion, or rather hysteric fit.A gentleman coming casually in,
looking on her arm, found that part powdered with red crosses, set in
most exact and wonderful order, neither swelled nor depressed, about
this shape,

          x
      x       x
    x     x     x
      x       x
          x

not seeming to be any way made by artifice, of a reddish color, not so
red as blood, the skin over them smooth, the rest of the arm livid and
of a mortified hue, with certain prints, as it were, of the stroke of
fingers.This had happened three several times in July, at about ten
days' interval, the crosses beginning to wear out, but the successive
ones set in other different, yet uniform order.The maid seemed very
modest, and came from London to Deptford with her mistress, to avoid the
discourse and importunity of curious people.She made no gain by it,
pretended no religious fancies; but seemed to be a plain, ordinary,
silent, working wench, somewhat fat, short, and high-.She told
me divers divines and physicians had seen her, but were unsatisfied;
that she had taken some remedies against her fits, but they did her no
good; she had never before had any fits; once since, she seemed in her
sleep to hear one say to her that she should tamper no more with them,
nor trouble herself with anything that happened, but put her trust in
the merits of Christ only.This is the substance of what she told me, and what I saw and curiously
examined.I was formerly acquainted with the impostorious nuns of
Loudun, in France, which made such noise among the <DW7>s; I therefore
thought this worth the notice.I remember Monsieur Monconys[19] (that
curious traveler and a Roman Catholic) was by no means satisfied with
the _stigmata_ of those nuns, because they were so shy of letting him
scrape the letters, which were Jesus, Maria, Joseph (as I think),
observing they began to scale off with it, whereas this poor wench was
willing to submit to any trial; so that I profess I know not what to
think of it, nor dare I pronounce it anything supernatural.[Footnote 19: Balthasar de Monconys, a Frenchman, celebrated for his
    travels in the East, which he published in three volumes.His object
    was to discover vestiges of the philosophy of Trismegistus and
    Zoroaster; in which, it is hardly necessary to add, he was not very
    successful.]At Windsor I supped with the Duke of Monmouth; and,
the next day, invited by Lord Arlington, dined with the same Duke and
divers Lords.After dinner my Lord and I had a conference of more than
an hour alone in his bedchamber, to engage me in the History.I showed
him something that I had drawn up, to his great satisfaction, and he
desired me to show it to the Treasurer.One of the Canons preached; then followed the
offering of the Knights of the Order, according to custom; first the
poor Knights, in procession, then, the Canons in their formalities, the
Dean and Chancellor, then his Majesty (the Sovereign), the Duke of York,
Prince Rupert; and, lastly, the Earl of Oxford, being all the Knights
that were then at Court.I dined with the Treasurer, and consulted with him what pieces I was to
add; in the afternoon the King took me aside into the balcony over the
terrace, extremely pleased with what had been told him I had begun, in
order to his commands, and enjoining me to proceed vigorously in it.He
told me he had ordered the Secretaries of State to give me all necessary
assistance of papers and particulars relating to it and enjoining me to
make it a LITTLE KEEN, for that the Hollanders had very unhandsomely
abused him in their pictures, books, and libels.Windsor was now going to be repaired, being exceedingly ragged and
ruinous.Prince Rupert, the Constable, had begun to trim up the keep or
high round Tower, and handsomely adorned his hall with furniture of
arms, which was very singular, by so disposing the pikes, muskets,
pistols, bandoleers, holsters, drums, back, breast, and headpieces, as
was very extraordinary.Thus, those huge steep stairs ascending to it
had the walls invested with this martial furniture, all new and bright,
so disposing the bandoleers, holsters, and drums, as to represent
festoons, and that without any confusion, trophy-like.From the hall we
went into his bedchamber, and ample rooms hung with tapestry, curious
and effeminate pictures, so extremely different from the other, which
presented nothing but war and horror.The King passed most of his time in hunting the stag, and walking in the
park, which he was now planting with rows of trees.To visit Sir Richard Lashford, my kinsman, and Mr.Charles Howard, at his extraordinary garden, at Deepden.Arthur Onslow, at West
Clandon, a pretty dry seat on the Downs, where we dined in his great
room.Hussey, who, being near Wotton, lives
in a sweet valley, deliciously watered.To Albury, to see how that garden proceeded, which
I found exactly done to the design and plot I had made, with the crypta
through the mountain in the park, thirty perches in length.Such a
Pausilippe[20] is nowhere in England.The canal was now digging, and the
vineyard planted.[Footnote 20: A word adopted by Evelyn for a subterranean passage,
    from the famous grot of Pausilippo, at Naples.]I spent the whole afternoon in private with the
Treasurer who put into my hands those secret pieces and transactions
concerning the Dutch war, and particularly the expedition of Bergen, in
which he had himself the chief part, and gave me instructions, till the
King arriving from Newmarket, we both went up into his bedchamber.Dined with the Treasurer; and, after dinner, we
were shut up together.I received other [further] advices, and ten paper
books of dispatches and treaties; to return which again I gave a note
under my hand to Mr.I was this morning fifty years of age; the Lord
teach me to number my days so as to apply them to his glory!Saw the Prince of Orange, newly come to see the
King, his uncle; he has a manly, courageous, wise countenance,
resembling his mother and the Duke of Gloucester, both deceased.I now also saw that famous beauty, but in my opinion of a childish,
simple, and baby face, Mademoiselle Querouaille,[21] lately Maid of
Honor to Madame, and now to be so to the Queen.[Footnote 21: Henrietta, the King's sister, married to Philip, Duke
    of Orleans, was then on a visit here.Madame Querouaille came over
    in her train, on purpose to entice Charles into an union with Louis
    XIV.; a design which unhappily succeeded but too well.She became
    the King's mistress, was made Duchess of Portsmouth, and was his
    favorite till his death.]Dined with the Earl of Arlington, where was the
Venetian Ambassador, of whom I now took solemn leave, now on his return.There were also Lords Howard, Wharton, Windsor, and divers other great
persons.I dined with the Treasurer, where was the Earl of
Rochester, a very profane wit.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th December, 1670.It was the thickest and darkest fog on the Thames
that was ever known in the memory of man, and I happened to be in the
very midst of it.I supped with Monsieur Zulestein, late Governor to the
late Prince of Orange.Bohun, my son's tutor, had been five years in
my house, and now Bachelor of Laws, and Fellow of New College, went from
me to Oxford to reside there, having well and faithfully performed his
charge.This day I first acquainted his Majesty with that
incomparable young man, Gibbon,[22] whom I had lately met with in an
obscure place by mere accident, as I was walking near a poor solitary
thatched house, in a field in our parish, near Sayes Court.I found him
shut in; but looking in at the window, I perceived him carving that
large cartoon, or crucifix, of Tintoretto, a copy of which I had myself
brought from Venice, where the original painting remains.I asked if I
might enter; he opened the door civilly to me, and I saw him about such
a work as for the curiosity of handling, drawing, and studious
exactness, I never had before seen in all my travels.I questioned him
why he worked in such an obscure and lonesome place; he told me it was
that he might apply himself to his profession without interruption, and
wondered not a little how I found him out.I asked if he was unwilling
to be made known to some great man, for that I believed it might turn to
his profit; he answered, he was yet but a beginner, but would not be
sorry to sell off that piece; on demanding the price, he said L100.In
good earnest, the very frame was worth the money, there being nothing in
nature so tender and delicate as the flowers and festoons about it, and
yet the work was very strong; in the piece was more than one hundred
figures of men, etc.I found he was likewise musical, and very civil,
sober, and discreet in his discourse.There was only an old woman in the
house.So, desiring leave to visit him sometimes, I went away.[Footnote 22: Better known by the name of Grinling Gibbon;
    celebrated for his exquisite carving.Some of his most astonishing
    work is at Chatsworth and at Petworth.]Of this young artist, together with my manner of finding him out, I
acquainted the King, and begged that he would give me leave to bring him
and his work to Whitehall, for that I would adventure my reputation with
his Majesty that he had never seen anything approach it, and that he
would be exceedingly pleased, and employ him.The King said he would
himself go see him.This was the first notice his Majesty ever had of
Mr.The King came to me in the Queen's withdrawing-room
from the circle of ladies, to talk with me as to what advance I had made
in the Dutch History.I dined with the Treasurer, and afterward we went
to the Secretary's Office, where we conferred about divers particulars.I was directed to go to Sir George Downing, who
having been a public minister in Holland, at the beginning of the war,
was to give me light in some material passages.This year the weather was so wet, stormy, and unseasonable, as had not
been known in many years.I saw the great ball danced by the Queen and
distinguished ladies at Whitehall Theater.Next day; was acted there the
famous play, called, "The Siege of Granada," two days acted
successively; there were indeed very glorious scenes and perspectives,
the work of Mr.[23]

    [Footnote 23: Evelyn here refers to Dryden's "Conquest of Granada".]Pepys, Clerk of the Acts, two extraordinary,
ingenious, and knowing persons, and other friends.I carried them to see
the piece of carving which I had recommended to the King.Came to visit me one of the Lords Commissioners of
Scotland for the Union.The Treasurer acquainted me that his Majesty was
graciously pleased to nominate me one of the Council of Foreign
Plantations, and give me a salary of L500 per annum, to encourage me.I went to thank the Treasurer, who was my great
friend and loved me; I dined with him and much company, and went thence
to my Lord Arlington, Secretary of State, in whose favor I likewise was
upon many occasions, though I cultivated neither of their friendships by
any mean submissions.I kissed his Majesty's hand, on his making me one
of the new-established Council.[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st March, 1671.Gibbon to bring to Whitehall his
excellent piece of carving, where being come, I advertised his Majesty,
who asked me where it was; I told him in Sir Richard Browne's (my
father-in-law) chamber, and that if it pleased his Majesty to appoint
whither it should be brought, being large and though of wood, heavy, I
would take care for it."No," says the King, "show me the way, I'll go
to Sir Richard's chamber," which he immediately did, walking along the
entries after me; as far as the ewry, till he came up into the room,
where I also lay.No sooner was he entered and cast his eyes on the
work, but he was astonished at the curiosity of it; and having
considered it a long time, and discoursed with Mr.Gibbon, whom I
brought to kiss his hand, he commanded it should be immediately carried
to the Queen's side to show her.It was carried up into her bedchamber,
where she and the King looked on and admired it again; the King, being
called away, left us with the Queen, believing she would have bought it,
it being a crucifix; but, when his Majesty was gone, a French peddling
woman, one Madame de Boord, who used to bring petticoats and fans, and
baubles, out of France to the ladies, began to find fault with several
things in the work, which she understood no more than an ass, or a
monkey, so as in a kind of indignation, I caused the person who brought
it to carry it back to the chamber, finding the Queen so much governed
by an ignorant Frenchwoman, and this incomparable artist had his labor
only for his pains, which not a little displeased me; and he was fain to
send it down to his cottage again; he not long after sold it for L80,
though well worth L100, without the frame, to Sir George Viner.Wren, faithfully promised me to employ
him.[24] I having also bespoke his Majesty for his work at Windsor,
which my friend, Mr.May, the architect there, was going to alter, and
repair universally; for, on the next day, I had a fair opportunity of
talking to his Majesty about it, in the lobby next the Queen's side,
where I presented him with some sheets of my history.James's Park to the garden, where I both saw and
heard a very familiar discourse between... and Mrs.Nelly,[25] as they
called an impudent comedian, she looking out of her garden on a terrace
at the top of the wall, and... standing on the green walk under it.I
was heartily sorry at this scene.Thence the King walked to the Duchess
of Cleveland, another lady of pleasure, and curse of our nation.[Footnote 24: The carving in the choir, etc., of St.Paul's
    Cathedral was executed by Gibbon.][Footnote 25: Nell Gwynne: there can be no doubt as to the name with
    which we are to fill up these blanks.This familiar interview of
    Nelly and the King has afforded a subject for painters.]I dined at Greenwich, to take leave of Sir Thomas
Linch, going Governor of Jamaica.To London, about passing my patent as one of the
standing Council for Plantations, a considerable honor, the others in
the Council being chiefly noblemen and officers of state.[Illustration: _NELL GWYNNE_

_Photogravure after Sir Peter Lely_]

2d April, 1671.To Sir Thomas Clifford, the Treasurer, to condole with
him on the loss of his eldest son, who died at Florence.The French King, being now with a great army of 28,000 men
about Dunkirk, divers of the grandees of that Court, and a vast number
of gentlemen and cadets, in fantastical habits, came flocking over to
see our Court and compliment his Majesty.I was present, when they first
were conducted into the Queen's withdrawing-room, where saluted their
Majesties the Dukes of Guise, Longueville, and many others of the first
rank.Treasurer's,[26] in company with Monsieur
De Grammont and several French noblemen, and one Blood, that impudent,
bold fellow who had not long before attempted to steal the imperial
crown itself out of the Tower, pretending only curiosity of seeing the
regalia there, when, stabbing the keeper, though not mortally, he boldly
went away with it through all the guards, taken only by the accident of
his horse falling down.How he came to be pardoned, and even received
into favor, not only after this, but several other exploits almost as
daring both in Ireland and here, I could never come to understand.Some
believed he became a spy of several parties, being well with the
sectaries and enthusiasts, and did his Majesty services that way, which
none alive could do so well as he; but it was certainly the boldest
attempt, so the only treason of this sort that was ever pardoned.This
man had not only a daring but a villanous, unmerciful look, a false
countenance, but very well-spoken and dangerously insinuating.[Footnote 26: This entry of 10th May, 1671, so far as it relates to
    Blood, and the stealing of the crown, etc., is a mistake.Blood
    stole the crown on the 9th of May, 1671--the very day before; and
    the "not long before" of Evelyn, and the circumstance of his being
    "pardoned," which Evelyn also mentions, can hardly be said to relate
    to only the day before.]I went to Eltham, to sit as one of the commissioners
about the subsidy now given by Parliament to his Majesty.Treasurer's [Sir Thomas Clifford] with
the Earl of Arlington, Carlingford, Lord Arundel of Wardour, Lord
Almoner to the Queen, a French Count and two abbots, with several more
of French nobility; and now by something I had lately observed of Mr.Treasurer's conversation on occasion, I suspected him a little warping
to Rome.I dined at a feast made for me and my wife by the
Trinity Company, for our passing a fine of the land which Sir R. Browne,
my wife's father, freely gave to found and build their college, or
almshouses on, at Deptford, it being my wife's after her father's
decease.It was a good and charitable work and gift, but would have been
better bestowed on the poor of that parish, than on the seamen's widows,
the Trinity Company being very rich, and the rest of the poor of the
parish exceedingly indigent.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th May, 1671.The Earl of Bristol's house in Queen's Street
[Lincoln's Inn Fields] was taken for the Commissioners of Trade and
Plantations, and furnished with rich hangings of the King's.It
consisted of seven rooms on a floor, with a long gallery, gardens, etc.This day we met the Duke of Buckingham, Earl of Lauderdale, Lord
Culpeper, Sir George Carteret, Vice-Chamberlain, and myself, had the
oaths given us by the Earl of Sandwich, our President.It was to advise
and counsel his Majesty, to the best of our abilities, for the
well-governing of his Foreign Plantations, etc., the form very little
differing from that given to the Privy Council.We then took our places
at the Board in the Council-Chamber, a very large room furnished with
atlases, maps, charts, globes, etc.Then came the Lord Keeper, Sir
Orlando Bridgeman, Earl of Arlington, Secretary of State, Lord Ashley,
Mr.Treasurer, Sir John Trevor, the other Secretary, Sir John Duncomb,
Lord Allington, Mr.Grey, son to the Lord Grey, Mr.Henry Broncher, Sir
Humphrey Winch, Sir John Finch, Mr.Waller, and Colonel Titus, of the
bedchamber, with Mr.Slingsby, Secretary to the Council, and two Clerks
of the Council, who had all been sworn some days before.Being all set,
our Patent was read, and then the additional Patent, in which was
recited this new establishment; then, was delivered to each a copy of
the Patent, and of instructions: after which, we proceeded to business.The first thing we did was, to settle the form of a circular letter to
the Governors of all his Majesty's Plantations and Territories in the
West Indies and Islands thereof, to give them notice to whom they should
apply themselves on all occasions, and to render us an account of their
present state and government; but, what we most insisted on was, to know
the condition of New England, which appearing to be very independent as
to their regard to Old England, or his Majesty, rich and strong as they
now were, there were great debates in what style to write to them; for
the condition of that Colony was such, that they were able to contest
with all other Plantations about them, and there was fear of their
breaking from all dependence on this nation; his Majesty, therefore,
commended this affair more expressly.We, therefore, thought fit, in the
first place, to acquaint ourselves as well as we could of the state of
that place, by some whom we heard of that were newly come from thence,
and to be informed of their present posture and condition; some of our
Council were for sending them a menacing letter, which those who better
understood the peevish and touchy humor of that Colony, were utterly
against.A letter was then read from Sir Thomas Modiford, Governor of Jamaica;
and then the Council broke up.Having brought an action against one Cocke, for money which he had
received for me, it had been referred to an arbitration by the
recommendation of that excellent good man, the Chief-Justice Hale,[27]
but, this not succeeding, I went to advise with that famous lawyer, Mr.Jones, of Gray's Inn, and, 27th of May, had a trial before Lord Chief
Justice Hale; and, after the lawyers had wrangled sufficiently, it was
referred to a new arbitration.This was the very first suit at law that
ever I had with any creature, and oh, that it might be the last![Footnote 27: Sir Matthew Hale, so famous as one of the justices of
    the bench in Cromwell's time.After the Restoration, he became Chief
    Baron of the Exchequer; then Chief Justice of the King's Bench, and
    died in 1676.The author of numerous works, not only on professional
    subjects, but on mathematics and philosophy.]I went to Council, where was produced a most exact and
ample information of the state of Jamaica, and of the best expedients as
to New England, on which there was a long debate; but at length it was
concluded that, if any, it should be only a conciliating paper at first,
or civil letter, till we had better information of the present face of
things, since we understood they were a people almost upon the very
brink of renouncing any dependence on the Crown.To a splendid dinner at the great room in Deptford
Trinity House, Sir Thomas Allen chosen Master, and succeeding the Earl
of Craven.[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th June, 1671.To carry Colonel Middleton to Whitehall, to my Lord
Sandwich, our President, for some information which he was able to give
of the state of the Colony in New England.To Council again, when one Colonel Cartwright, a
Nottinghamshire man, (formerly in commission with Colonel Nicholls) gave
us a considerable relation of that country; on which the Council
concluded that in the first place a letter of amnesty should be
dispatched.Constantine Huygens, Signor of Zuylichem, that
excellent learned man, poet, and musician, now near eighty years of age,
a vigorous, brisk man,[28] came to take leave of me before his return
into Holland with the Prince, whose Secretary he was.[Footnote 28: He died in 1687, at the great age of 90 years and 6
    months.Constantine and his son, Christian Huygens, were both
    eminent for scientific knowledge and classical attainments;
    Christian, particularly so; for he was the inventor of the pendulum,
    made an improvement in the air-pump, first discovered the ring and
    one of the satellites of Saturn, and ascertained the laws of
    collision of elastic bodies.Constantine, the
    father, was a person of influence and distinction in Holland, and
    held the post of secretary to the Prince of Orange.]To Council, where Lord Arlington acquainted us that it
was his Majesty's proposal we should, every one of us, contribute L20
toward building a Council chamber and conveniences somewhere in
Whitehall, that his Majesty might come and sit among us, and hear our
debates; the money we laid out to be reimbursed out of the contingent
moneys already set apart for us, viz, L1,000 yearly.To this we
unanimously consented.There came an uncertain bruit from Barbadoes of
some disorder there.On my return home I stepped in at the theater to
see the new machines for the intended scenes, which were indeed very
costly and magnificent.To Council, where were letters from Sir Thomas
Modiford, of the expedition and exploit of Colonel Morgan, and others of
Jamaica, on the Spanish Continent at Panama.To Council, where we drew up and agreed to a letter to
be sent to New England, and made some proposal to Mr.Gorges, for his
interest in a plantation there.Surveyor brought us a plot for the
building of our Council chamber, to be erected at the end of the Privy
garden, in Whitehall.The matter in debate
was, whether we should send a deputy to New England, requiring them of
the Massachusetts to restore such to their limits and respective
possessions, as had petitioned the Council; this to be the open
commission only; but, in truth, with secret instructions to inform us of
the condition of those Colonies, and whether they were of such power, as
to be able to resist his Majesty and declare for themselves as
independent of the Crown, which we were told, and which of late years
made them refractory.Colonel Middleton, being called in, assured us
they might be curbed by a few of his Majesty's first-rate frigates, to
spoil their trade with the islands; but, though my Lord President was
not satisfied, the rest were, and we did resolve to advise his Majesty
to send Commissioners with a formal commission for adjusting boundaries,
etc., with some other instructions.The letters of Sir Thomas Modiford were
read, giving relation of the exploit at Panama, which was very brave;
they took, burned, and pillaged the town of vast treasures, but the best
of the booty had been shipped off, and lay at anchor in the South Sea,
so that, after our men had ranged the country sixty miles about, they
went back to Nombre de Dios, and embarked for Jamaica.Such an action
had not been done since the famous Drake.I dined at the Hamburg Resident's, and, after dinner, went to the
christening of Sir Samuel Tuke's son, Charles, at Somerset House, by a
Popish priest, and many odd ceremonies.The godfathers were the King,
and Lord Arundel of Wardour, and godmother, the Countess of Huntingdon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

29th August, 1671.To London, with some more papers of my progress in
the Dutch War, delivered to the Treasurer.Dined with the Treasurer, in company with my Lord
Arlington, Halifax, and Sir Thomas Strickland; and next day, went home,
being the anniversary of the late dreadful fire of London.In the afternoon at Council, where letters were
read from Sir Charles Wheeler, concerning his resigning his government
of St.I dined in the city, at the fraternity feast in
Ironmongers' Hall, where the four stewards chose their successors for
the next year, with a solemn procession, garlands about their heads, and
music playing before them; so, coming up to the upper tables where the
gentlemen sat, they drank to the new stewards; and so we parted.I dined at the Treasurer's, where I had discourse
with Sir Henry Jones (now come over to raise a regiment of horse),
concerning the French conquests in Lorraine; he told me the King sold
all things to the soldiers, even to a handful of hay.After dinner, the Treasurer carried me to Lincoln's Inn, to one of the
Parliament Clerks, to obtain of him, that I might carry home and peruse,
some of the Journals, which were, accordingly, delivered to me to
examine about the late Dutch War.Returning home, I went on shore to see
the Custom House, now newly rebuilt since the dreadful conflagration.[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th and 10th October, 1671.I went, after evening service, to London,
in order to a journey of refreshment with Mr.Treasurer, to Newmarket,
where the King then was, in his coach with six brave horses, which we
changed thrice, first, at Bishop-Stortford, and last, at Chesterford;
so, by night, we got to Newmarket, where Mr.Henry Jermain (nephew to
the Earl of St.We proceeded immediately
to Court, the King and all the English gallants being there at their
autumnal sports.Supped at the Lord Chamberlain's; and, the next day,
after dinner, I was on the heath, where I saw the great match run
between Woodcock and Flatfoot, belonging to the King, and to Mr.Eliot,
of the bedchamber, many thousands being spectators; a more signal race
had not been run for many years.This over, I went that night with Mr.Treasurer to Euston, a palace of
Lord Arlington's, where we found Monsieur Colbert (the French
Ambassador), and the famous new French Maid of Honor, Mademoiselle
Querouaille, now coming to be in great favor with the King.Here was
also the Countess of Sunderland, and several lords and ladies, who
lodged in the house.During my stay here with Lord Arlington, near a fortnight, his Majesty
came almost every second day with the Duke, who commonly returned to
Newmarket, but the King often lay here, during which time I had twice
the honor to sit at dinner with him, with all freedom.It was
universally reported that the fair lady ----, was bedded one of these
nights, and the stocking flung, after the manner of a married bride; I
acknowledge she was for the most part in her undress all day, and that
there was fondness and toying with that young wanton; nay, it was said,
I was at the former ceremony; but it is utterly false; I neither saw nor
heard of any such thing while I was there, though I had been in her
chamber, and all over that apartment late enough, and was myself
observing all passages with much curiosity.However, it was with
confidence believed she was first made _a Miss_, as they called these
unhappy creatures, with solemnity at this time.On Sunday, a young Cambridge divine preached an excellent sermon in the
chapel, the King and the Duke of York being present.Came all the great men from Newmarket, and other
parts both of Suffolk and Norfolk, to make their court, the whole house
filled from one end to the other with lords, ladies, and gallants; there
was such a furnished table, as I had seldom seen, nor anything more
splendid and free, so that for fifteen days there were entertained at
least 200 people, and half as many horses, besides servants and guards,
at infinite expense.In the morning, we went hunting and hawking; in the afternoon, till
almost morning, to cards and dice, yet I must say without noise,
swearing, quarrel, or confusion of any sort.I, who was no gamester, had
often discourse with the French Ambassador, Colbert, and went sometimes
abroad on horseback with the ladies to take the air, and now and then to
hunting; thus idly passing the time, but not without more often recess
to my pretty apartment, where I was quite out of all this hurry, and had
leisure when I would, to converse with books, for there is no man more
hospitably easy to be withal than my Lord Arlington, of whose particular
friendship and kindness I had ever a more than ordinary share.His house
is a very noble pile, consisting of four pavilions after the French,
beside a body of a large house, and, though not built altogether, but
formed of additions to an old house (purchased by his Lordship of one
Sir T. Rookwood) yet with a vast expense made not only capable and
roomsome, but very magnificent and commodious, as well within as
without, nor less splendidly furnished.The staircase is very elegant,
the garden handsome, the canal beautiful, but the soil dry, barren, and
miserably sandy, which flies in drifts as the wind sits.Here my Lord
was pleased to advise with me about ordering his plantations of firs,
elms, limes, etc., up his park, and in all other places and avenues.I
persuaded him to bring his park so near as to comprehend his house
within it; which he resolved upon, it being now near a mile to it.The
water furnishing the fountains, is raised by a pretty engine, or very
slight plain wheels, which likewise serve to grind his corn, from a
small cascade of the canal, the invention of Sir Samuel Morland.In my
Lord's house, and especially above the staircase, in the great hall and
some of the chambers and rooms of state, are paintings in fresco by
Signor Verrio, being the first work which he did in England.[Sidenote: NORWICH]

17th October, 1671.My Lord Henry Howard coming this night to visit my
Lord Chamberlain, and staying a day, would needs have me go with him to
Norwich, promising to convey me back, after a day or two; this, as I
could not refuse, I was not hard to be pursuaded to, having a desire to
see that famous scholar and physician, Dr.T. Browne, author of the
"_Religio Medici_" and "Vulgar Errors," now lately knighted.Thither,
then, went my Lord and I alone, in his flying chariot with six horses;
and by the way, discoursing with me of several of his concerns, he
acquainted me of his going to marry his eldest son to one of the King's
natural daughters, by the Duchess of Cleveland; by which he reckoned he
should come into mighty favor.He also told me that, though he kept that
idle creature, Mrs.B----, and would leave L200 a year to the son he had
by her, he would never marry her, and that the King himself had
cautioned him against it.All the world knows how he kept his promise,
and I was sorry at heart to hear what now he confessed to me; and that a
person and a family which I so much honored for the sake of that noble
and illustrious friend of mine, his grandfather, should dishonor and
pollute them both with those base and vicious courses he of late had
taken since the death of Sir Samuel Tuke, and that of his own virtuous
lady (my Lady Anne Somerset, sister to the Marquis); who, while they
lived, preserved this gentleman by their example and advice from those
many extravagances that impaired both his fortune and reputation.Being come to the Ducal palace, my Lord made very much of me; but I had
little rest, so exceedingly desirous he was to show me the contrivance
he had made for the entertainment of their Majesties, and the whole
Court not long before, and which, though much of it was but temporary,
apparently framed of boards only, was yet standing.As to the palace, it
is an old wretched building, and that part of it newly built of brick,
is very ill understood; so as I was of the opinion it had been much
better to have demolished all, and set it up in a better place, than to
proceed any further; for it stands in the very market-place, and, though
near a river, yet a very narrow muddy one, without any extent.Next morning, I went to see Sir Thomas Browne (with whom I had some
time corresponded by letter, though I had never seen him before); his
whole house and garden being a paradise and cabinet of rarities; and
that of the best collection, especially medals, books, plants, and
natural things.Among other curiosities, Sir Thomas had a collection of
the eggs of all the fowl and birds he could procure, that country
(especially the promontory of Norfolk) being frequented, as he said, by
several kinds which seldom or never go further into the land, as cranes,
storks, eagles, and variety of water fowl.He led me to see all the
remarkable places of this ancient city, being one of the largest, and
certainly, after London, one of the noblest of England, for its
venerable cathedral, number of stately churches, cleanness of the
streets, and buildings of flint so exquisitely headed and squared, as I
was much astonished at; but he told me they had lost the art of squaring
the flints, in which they so much excelled, and of which the churches,
best houses, and walls, are built.The Castle is an antique extent of
ground, which now they call Marsfield, and would have been a fitting
area to have placed the Ducal palace in.The suburbs are large, the
prospects sweet, with other amenities, not omitting the flower gardens,
in which all the inhabitants excel.The fabric of stuffs brings a vast
trade to this populous town.Being returned to my Lord's, who had been with me all this morning, he
advised with me concerning a plot to rebuild his house, having already,
as he said, erected a front next the street, and a left wing, and now
resolving to set up another wing and pavilion next the garden, and to
convert the bowling green into stables.My advice was, to desist from
all, and to meditate wholly on rebuilding a handsome palace at Arundel
House, in the Strand, before he proceeded further here, and then to
place this in the Castle, that ground belonging to his Lordship.I observed that most of the church yards (though some of them large
enough) were filled up with earth, or rather the congestion of dead
bodies one upon another, for want of earth, even to the very top of the
walls, and some above the walls, so as the churches seemed to be built
in pits.I returned to Euston, in Lord Henry Howard's coach,
leaving him at Norwich, in company with a very ingenious gentleman, Mr.White, whose father and mother (daughter to the late Lord Treasurer
Weston, Earl of Portland) I knew at Rome, where this gentleman was born,
and where his parents lived and died with much reputation, during their
banishment in our civil broils.Quitting Euston, I lodged this night at Newmarket,
where I found the jolly blades racing, dancing, feasting, and reveling;
more resembling a luxurious and abandoned rout, than a Christian Court.The Duke of Buckingham was now in mighty favor, and had with him that
impudent woman, the Countess of Shrewsbury, with his band of fiddlers,
etc.Next morning, in company with Sir Bernard Gascoyne, and Lord Hawley, I
came in the Treasurer's coach to Bishop Stortford, where he gave us a
noble supper.The following day, to London, and so home.To Council, where Sir Charles Wheeler, late
Governor of the Leeward Islands, having been complained of for many
indiscreet managements, it was resolved, on scanning many of the
particulars, to advise his Majesty to remove him; and consult what was
to be done, to prevent these inconveniences he had brought things to.This business staid me in London almost a week, being in Council, or
Committee, every morning till the 25th.We ordered that a proclamation should be presented
to his Majesty to sign, against what Sir Charles Wheeler had done in St.Christopher's since the war, on the articles of peace at Breda.Came to visit me Sir William Haywood, a great
pretender to English antiquities.Went to see the Duke of Buckingham's ridiculous
farce and rhapsody, called the "The Recital,"[29] buffooning all plays,
yet profane enough.[Footnote 29: The well-known play of "The Rehearsal" is meant.]The Councillors of the Board of Trade dined together
at the Cock, in Suffolk street.His Majesty renewed us our lease of Sayes Court
pastures for ninety-nine years, but ought, according to his solemn
promise[30] (as I hope he will still perform), have passed them to us in
fee-farm.[Footnote 30: The King's engagement, under his hand, is now at
    Wotton.][Sidenote: LONDON]

23d January, 1672.To London, in order to Sir Richard Browne, my
father-in-law, resigning his place as Clerk of the Council to Joseph
Williamson, Esq., who was admitted, and was knighted.This place his
Majesty had promised to give me many years before; but, upon
consideration of the renewal of our lease and other reasons, I chose to
part with it to Sir Joseph, who gave us and the rest of his brother
clerks a handsome supper at his house; and, after supper, a concert of
music.An extraordinary snow; part of the week was taken up
in consulting about the commission of prisoners of war, and instructions
to our officers, in order to a second war with the Hollanders, his
Majesty having made choice of the former commissioners, and myself among
them.In the afternoon, that famous proselyte, Monsieur
Brevall, preached at the Abbey, in English, extremely well and with much
eloquence.He had been a Capuchin, but much better learned than most of
that order.At the Council, we entered on inquiries about
improving the plantations by silks, galls, flax, senna, etc., and
considered how nutmegs and cinnamon might be obtained and brought to
Jamaica, that soil and climate promising success.Worsley being
called in, spoke many considerable things to encourage it.We took order
to send to the plantations, that none of their ships should adventure
homeward single, but stay for company and convoys.We also deliberated
on some fit person to go as commissioner to inspect their actions in New
England, and, from time to time, report how that people stood affected.Parr, of Camberwell, preached a most pathetic
funeral discourse and panegyric at the interment of our late pastor, Dr.Breton (who died on the 18th), on "Happy is the servant whom, when his
Lord cometh," etc.This good man, among other expressions, professed
that he had never been so touched and concerned at any loss as at this,
unless at that of King Charles our martyr, and Archbishop Usher, whose
chaplain he had been.Breton had preached on the 28th and 30th of
January: on the Friday, having fasted all day, making his provisionary
sermon for the Sunday following, he went well to bed; but was taken
suddenly ill and expired before help could come to him.Never had a parish a greater loss, not only as he was an excellent
preacher, and fitted for our great and vulgar auditory, but for his
excellent life and charity, his meekness and obliging nature,
industrious, helpful, and full of good works.He left near L400 to the
poor in his will, and that what children of his should die in their
minority, their portion should be so employed, I lost in particular a
special friend, and one that had an extraordinary love for me and mine.[Sidenote: LONDON]

25th February, 1672.To London, to speak with the Bishop, and Sir John
Cutler, our patron, to present Mr.Frampton (afterward Bishop of
Gloucester).A full Council of Plantations, on the danger of the
Leeward Islands, threatened by the French, who had taken some of our
ships, and began to interrupt our trade.Also in debate, whether the new
Governor of St.Christopher should be subordinate to the Governor of
Barbadoes.Now was the first blow given by us to the Dutch convoy
of the Smyrna fleet, by Sir Robert Holmes and Lord Ossory, in which we
received little save blows, and a worthy reproach for attacking our
neighbors ere any war was proclaimed, and then pretending the occasion
to be, that some time before, the Merlin yacht chancing to sail through
the whole Dutch fleet, their Admiral did not strike to that trifling
vessel.Surely, this was a quarrel slenderly grounded, and not becoming
Christian neighbors.Lord Ossory
several times deplored to me his being engaged in it; he had more
justice and honor than in the least to approve of it, though he had been
over-persuaded to the expedition.There is no doubt but we should have
surprised this exceeding rich fleet, had not the avarice and ambition of
Holmes and Spragge separated themselves, and willfully divided our
fleet, on presumption that either of them was strong enough to deal with
the Dutch convoy without joining and mutual help; but they so warmly
plied our divided fleets, that while in conflict the merchants sailed
away, and got safe into Holland.A few days before this, the Treasurer of the Household, Sir Thomas
Clifford, hinted to me, as a confidant, that his Majesty would SHUT UP
THE EXCHEQUER (and, accordingly, his Majesty made use of infinite
treasure there, to prepare for an intended rupture); but, says he, it
will soon be open again, and everybody satisfied; for this bold man, who
had been the sole adviser of the King to invade that sacred stock
(though some pretend it was Lord Ashley's counsel, then Chancellor of
the Exchequer), was so over-confident of the success of this unworthy
design against the Smyrna merchants, as to put his Majesty on an action
which not only lost the hearts of his subjects, and ruined many widows
and orphans, whose stocks were lent him, but the reputation of his
Exchequer forever, it being before in such credit, that he might have
commanded half the wealth of the nation.The credit of this bank being thus broken, did exceedingly discontent
the people, and never did his Majesty's affairs prosper to any purpose
after it, for as it did not supply the expense of the meditated war, so
it melted away, I know not how.To this succeeded the King's declaration for an universal toleration;
<DW7>s and swarms of Sectaries, now boldly showing themselves in their
public meetings.This was imputed to the same council, Clifford warping
to Rome as was believed, nor was Lord Arlington clear of suspicion, to
gratify that party, but as since it has proved, and was then evidently
foreseen, to the extreme weakening of the Church of England and its
Episcopal Government, as it was projected.I speak not this as my own
sense, but what was the discourse and thoughts of others, who were
lookers-on; for I think there might be some relaxations without the
least prejudice to the present establishment, discreetly limited, but to
let go the reins in this manner, and then to imagine they could take
them up again as easily, was a false policy, and greatly destructive.The truth is, our Bishops slipped the occasion; for, had they held a
steady hand upon his Majesty's restoration, as they might easily have
done, the Church of England had emerged and flourished, without
interruption; but they were then remiss, and covetous after advantages
of another kind while his Majesty suffered them to come into a harvest,
with which, without any injustice he might have remunerated innumerable
gallant gentlemen for their services who had ruined themselves in the
late rebellion.I visited the coasts in my district of Kent, and
divers wounded and languishing poor men, that had been in the Smyrna
conflict.I went over to see the new-begun Fort of Tilbury; a royal
work, indeed, and such as will one day bridle a great city to the
purpose, before they are aware.Captain Cox, one of the Commissioners of the Navy,
furnishing me with a yatch, I sailed to Sheerness to see that fort also,
now newly finished; several places on both sides the Swale and Medway to
Gillingham and Upnore, being also provided with redoubts and batteries
to secure the station of our men-of-war at Chatham, and shut the door
when the steeds were stolen.I saw the chirurgeon cut off the leg of a wounded
sailor, the stout and gallant man enduring it with incredible patience,
without being bound to his chair, as usual on such painful occasions.I
had hardly courage enough to be present.Not being cut off high enough
the gangrene prevailed, and the second operation cost the poor creature
his life.what miseries are mortal men subject to, and what confusion and
mischief do the avarice, anger, and ambition of Princes, cause in the
world!I proceeded to Canterbury, Dover, Deal, the Isle of
Thanet, by Sandwich, and so to Margate.Here we had abundance of
miserably wounded men, his Majesty sending his chief chirurgeon,
Sergeant Knight, to meet me, and Dr.Waldrond had attended me all the
journey.Having taken order for the accommodation of the wounded, I came
back through a country the best cultivated of any that in my life I had
anywhere seen, every field lying as even as a bowling-green, and the
fences, plantations, and husbandry, in such admirable order, as
infinitely delighted me, after the sad and afflicting spectacles and
objects I was come from.Observing almost every tall tree to have a
weathercock on the top bough, and some trees half-a-dozen, I learned
that, on a certain holyday, the farmers feast their servants; at which
solemnity, they set up these cocks, in a kind of triumph.[Sidenote: ROCHESTER]

Being come back toward Rochester, I went to take order respecting the
building a strong and high wall about a house I had hired of a
gentleman, at a place called Hartlip, for a prison, paying L50 yearly
rent.Here I settled a Provost-Marshal and other officers, returning by
Feversham.On the 30th heard a sermon in Rochester cathedral, and so got
to Sayes Court on the first of April.I went to see the fopperies of the <DW7>s at
Somerset-House and York-House, where now the French Ambassador had
caused to be represented our Blessed Savior at the Pascal Supper with
his disciples, in figures and puppets made as big as the life, of
wax-work, curiously clad and sitting round a large table, the room nobly
hung, and shining with innumerable lamps and candles: this was exposed
to all the world; all the city came to see it.Such liberty had the
Roman Catholics at this time obtained.Sat in Council, preparing Lord Willoughby's commission
and instructions as Governor of Barbadoes and the Caribbee Islands.At Council, preparing instructions for Colonel
Stapleton, now to go Governor of St.Christopher's, and heard the
complaints of the Jamaica merchants against the Spaniards, for hindering
them from cutting logwood on the mainland, where they have no pretense.To my Lord of Canterbury, to entreat him to engage Sir
John Cutler, the patron, to provide us a grave and learned man, in
opposition to a novice.Treasurer Clifford's new honor,
being made a Baron.My son, John, was specially admitted of the Middle Temple
by Sir Francis North, his Majesty's Solicitor-General, and since
Chancellor.I pray God bless this beginning, my intention being that he
should seriously apply himself to the study of the law.I was ordered, by letter from the Council, to repair
forthwith to his Majesty, whom I found in the Pall-Mall, in St.James's
Park, where his Majesty coming to me from the company, commanded me to
go immediately to the seacoast, and to observe the motion of the Dutch
fleet and ours, the Duke and so many of the flower of our nation being
now under sail, coming from Portsmouth, through the Downs, where it was
believed there might be an encounter.Heard a sermon in Rochester
Cathedral.Bargrave, my old
fellow-traveler in Italy, and great virtuoso.To Dover; but the fleet did not appear till the 16th,
when the Duke of York with his and the French squadron, in all 170 ships
(of which above 100 were men-of-war), sailed by, after the Dutch, who
were newly withdrawn.Such a gallant and formidable navy never, I think,
spread sail upon the seas.It was a goodly yet terrible sight, to behold
them as I did, passing eastward by the straits between Dover and Calais
in a glorious day.The wind was yet so high, that I could not well go
aboard, and they were soon got out of sight.The next day, having
visited our prisoners and the Castle, and saluted the Governor, I took
horse for Margate.Here, from the North Foreland Lighthouse top (which
is a pharos, built of brick, and having on the top a cradle of iron, in
which a man attends a great sea-coal fire all the year long, when the
nights are dark, for the safeguard of sailors), we could see our fleet
as they lay at anchor.The next morning, they weighed, and sailed out of
sight to the N. E.[Sidenote: MARGATE]

19th May, 1672.Went to Margate; and, the following day, was carried to
see a gallant widow, brought up a farmeress, and I think of gigantic
race, rich, comely, and exceedingly industrious.She put me in mind of
Deborah and Abigail, her house was so plentifully stored with all manner
of country provisions, all of her own growth, and all her conveniences
so substantial, neat, and well understood; she herself so jolly and
hospitable; and her land so trim and rarely husbanded, that it struck me
with admiration at her economy.This town much consists of brewers of a certain heady ale, and they deal
much in malt, etc.For the rest, it is raggedly built, and has an ill
haven, with a small fort of little concernment, nor is the island well
disciplined; but as to the husbandry and rural part, far exceeding any
part of England for the accurate culture of their ground, in which they
exceed, even to curiosity and emulation.We passed by Rickborough, and in sight of Reculvers, and so through a
sweet garden, as it were, to Canterbury.To London and gave his Majesty an account of my journey,
and that I had put all things in readiness upon all events, and so
returned home sufficiently wearied.I received another command to repair to the seaside; so
I went to Rochester, where I found many wounded, sick, and prisoners,
newly put on shore after the engagement on the 28th, in which the Earl
of Sandwich, that incomparable person and my particular friend, and
divers more whom I loved, were lost.My Lord (who was Admiral of the
Blue) was in the "Prince," which was burnt, one of the best men-of-war
that ever spread canvas on the sea.There were lost with this brave man,
a son of Sir Charles Cotterell (Master of the Ceremonies), and a son of
Sir Charles Harbord (his Majesty's Surveyor-General), two valiant and
most accomplished youths, full of virtue and courage, who might have
saved themselves; but chose to perish with my Lord, whom they honored
and loved above their own lives.Here, I cannot but make some reflections on things past.It was not
above a day or two that going to Whitehall to take leave of his
Lordship, who had his lodgings in the Privy-Garden, shaking me by the
hand he bid me good-by, and said he thought he would see me no more, and
I saw, to my thinking, something boding in his countenance: "No," says
he, "they will not have me live.Had I lost a fleet (meaning on his
return from Bergen when he took the East India prize) I should have
fared better; but, be as it pleases God--I must do something, I know not
what, to save my reputation."Something to this effect, he had hinted to
me; thus I took my leave.I well remember that the Duke of Albemarle,
and my now Lord Clifford, had, I know not why, no great opinion of his
courage, because, in former conflicts, being an able and experienced
seaman (which neither of them were), he always brought off his Majesty's
ships without loss, though not without as many marks of true courage as
the stoutest of them; and I am a witness that, in the late war, his own
ship was pierced like a colander.But the business was, he was utterly
against this war from the beginning, and abhorred the attacking of the
Smyrna fleet; he did not favor the heady expedition of Clifford at
Bergen, nor was he so furious and confident as was the Duke of
Albemarle, who believed he could vanquish the Hollanders with one
squadron.My Lord Sandwich was prudent as well as valiant, and always
governed his affairs with success and little loss; he was for
deliberation and reason, they for action and slaughter without either;
and for this, whispered as if my Lord Sandwich was not so gallant,
because he was not so rash, and knew how fatal it was to lose a fleet,
such as was that under his conduct, and for which these very persons
would have censured him on the other side.This it was, I am confident,
grieved him, and made him enter like a lion, and fight like one too, in
the midst of the hottest service, where the stoutest of the rest seeing
him engaged, and so many ships upon him, dared not, or would not, come
to his succor, as some of them, whom I know, might have done.Thus, this
gallant person perished, to gratify the pride and envy of some I named.Deplorable was the loss of one of the best accomplished persons, not
only of this nation, but of any other.He was learned in sea affairs, in
politics, in mathematics, and in music: he had been on divers embassies,
was of a sweet and obliging temper, sober, chaste, very ingenious, a
true nobleman, an ornament to the Court and his Prince; nor has he left
any behind him who approach his many virtues.He had, I confess, served the tyrant Cromwell, when a young man, but it
was without malice, as a soldier of fortune; and he readily submitted,
and that with joy, bringing an entire fleet with him from the Sound, at
the first tidings of his Majesty's restoration.I verily believe him as
faithful a subject as any that were not his friends.I am yet heartily
grieved at this mighty loss, nor do I call it to my thoughts without
emotion.[Sidenote: ROCHESTER]

2d June, 1672.Trinity Sunday, I passed at Rochester; and, on the 5th,
there was buried in the Cathedral Monsieur Rabiniere, Rear Admiral of
the French squadron, a gallant person, who died of the wounds he
received in the fight.This ceremony lay on me, which I performed with
all the decency I could, inviting the Mayor and Aldermen to come in
their formalities.Sir Jonas Atkins was there with his guards; and the
Dean and Prebendaries: one of his countrymen pronouncing a funeral
oration at the brink of his grave, which I caused to be dug in the
choir.This is more at large described in the "Gazette" of that day;
Colonel Reymes, my colleague in commission, assisting, who was so kind
as to accompany me from London, though it was not his district; for
indeed the stress of both these wars lay more on me by far than on any
of my brethren, who had little to do in theirs.I went to see Upnore
Castle, which I found pretty well defended, but of no great moment.Next day I sailed to the fleet, now riding at the buoy of the "Nore,"
where I met his Majesty, the Duke, Lord Arlington, and all the great
men, in the "Charles," lying miserably shattered; but the miss of Lord
Sandwich redoubled the loss to me, and showed the folly of hazarding so
brave a fleet, and losing so many good men, for no provocation but that
the Hollanders exceeded us in industry, and in all things but envy.At Sheerness, I gave his Majesty and his Royal Highness an account of my
charge, and returned to Queenborough; next day dined at Major Dorel's,
Governor of Sheerness; thence, to Rochester; and the following day,
home.To London to his Majesty, to solicit for money for the
sick and wounded, which he promised me.Most of this week busied
with the sick and wounded.To Lord Sandwich's funeral, which was by water to
Westminster, in solemn pomp.I entertained the Maids of Honor (among whom there was
one I infinitely esteemed for her many and extraordinary virtues[31]) at
a comedy this afternoon, and so went home.Blagg whom Evelyn never tires of instancing and
    characterizing as a rare example of piety and virtue, in so rare a
    wit, beauty, and perfection, in a licentious court, and depraved
    age.Godolphin, and her life,
    written by Evelyn, has been edited and published by the Bishop of
    Oxford.]I was at the betrothal of Lord Arlington's only
daughter (a sweet child if ever there was any[32]) to the Duke of
Grafton, the King's natural son by the Duchess of Cleveland; the
Archbishop of Canterbury officiating, the King and the grandees being
present.I had a favor given me by my Lady; but took no great joy at the
thing for many reasons.[Footnote 32: She was then only fifteen years old.]Sir James Hayes, Secretary to Prince Rupert, dined
with me; after dinner I was sent to Gravesend to dispose of no fewer
than 800 sick men.That night I got to the fleet at the buoy of the
"Nore," where I spoke with the King and the Duke; and, after dinner next
day, returned to Gravesend.I spent this week in soliciting for moneys, and in
reading to my Lord Clifford my papers relating to the first Holland war.Now, our Council of Plantations met at Lord Shaftesbury's (Chancellor of
the Exchequer) to read and reform the draft of our new Patent, joining
the Council of Trade to our political capacities.After this, I returned
home, in order to another excursion to the seaside, to get as many as
possible of the men who were recovered on board the fleet.I lay at Gravesend, thence to Rochester, returning
on the 11th.Duport, Greek Professor of Cambridge, preached
before the King, on 1 Timothy vi.No great preacher, but a very
worthy and learned man.I dined at Lord John Berkeley's, newly arrived
out of Ireland, where he had been Deputy; it was in his new house, or
rather palace; for I am assured it stood him in near L30,000.It was
very well built, and has many noble rooms, but they are not very
convenient, consisting but of one _Corps de Logis_; they are all rooms
of state, without closets.The staircase is of cedar, the furniture is
princely: the kitchen and stables are ill placed, and the corridor
worse, having no report to the wings they join to.For the rest, the
fore-court is noble, so are the stables; and, above all, the gardens,
which are incomparable by reason of the inequality of the ground, and a
pretty piscina.The holly hedges on the terrace I advised the planting
of.The porticos are in imitation of a house described by Palladio; but
it happens to be the worst in his book, though my good friend, Mr.Hugh
May, his Lordship's architect, effected it.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th September, 1672.I carried with me to dinner my Lord H. Howard (now
to be made Earl of Norwich and Earl Marshal of England) to Sir Robert
Clayton's, now Sheriff of London, at his new house, where we had a great
feast; it is built indeed for a great magistrate, at excessive cost.The
cedar dining room is painted with the history of the Giants' War,
incomparably done by Mr.Streeter, but the figures are too near the eye.Thistlethwaite preached at Whitehall on Rev.2,--a young, but good preacher.Blandford, Bishop of Worcester, and Dean of the Chapel, officiating.Dined at my Lord Clifford's, with Lord Mulgrave, Sir Gilbert Talbot, and
Sir Robert Holmes.I took leave of my Lady Sunderland, who was going to
Paris to my Lord, now ambassador there.She made me stay to dinner at
Leicester House, and afterward sent for Richardson, the famous
fire-eater.He devoured brimstone on glowing coals before us, chewing
and swallowing them; he melted a beer-glass and ate it quite up; then,
taking a live coal on his tongue, he put on it a raw oyster, the coal
was blown on with bellows till it flamed and sparkled in his mouth, and
so remained till the oyster gaped and was quite boiled.Then, he melted
pitch and wax with sulphur, which he drank down as it flamed; I saw it
flaming in his mouth a good while; he also took up a thick piece of
iron, such as laundresses use to put in their smoothing boxes, when it
was fiery hot, held it between his teeth, then in his hand, and threw it
about like a stone; but this, I observed, he cared not to hold very
long; then he stood on a small pot, and, bending his body, took a
glowing iron with his mouth from between his feet, without touching the
pot, or ground, with his hands; with divers other prodigious feats.After sermon (being summoned before), I went to my
Lord Keeper's, Sir Orlando Bridgeman, at Essex House, where our new
patent was opened and read, constituting us that were of the Council of
Plantations, to be now of the Council of Trade also, both united.After
the patent was read, we all took our oaths, and departed.Met in Council, the Earl of Shaftesbury, now our
president, swearing our secretary and his clerks, which was Mr.Locke,
an excellent learned gentleman, and student of Christ Church, Mr.We dispatched a letter to Sir Thomas Linch, Governor of
Jamaica, giving him notice of a design of the Dutch on that island.I went to hear that famous preacher, Dr.Giles's, on Psalm xxxix.This divine had been twice at
Jerusalem, and was not only a very pious and holy man, but excellent in
the pulpit for the moving affections.At Council, we debated the business of the consulate
of Leghorn.I was of the committee with Sir Humphry Winch, the chairman,
to examine the laws of his Majesty's several plantations and colonies in
the West Indies, etc.Many merchants were summoned about the consulate of
Venice; which caused great disputes; the most considerable thought it
useless.This being the Queen-Consort's birthday, there was an
extraordinary appearance of gallantry, and a ball danced at Court.[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st January, 1672-73.After public prayers in the chapel at Whitehall,
when I gave God solemn thanks for all his mercies to me the year past,
and my humble supplications to him for his blessing the year now
entering, I returned home, having my poor deceased servant (Adams) to
bury, who died of pleurisy.My son now published his version of "_Raptinus
Hortorum_."Visited Don Francisco de Melos, the Portugal
Ambassador, who showed me his curious collection of books and pictures.He was a person of good parts, and a virtuous man.To Council about reforming an abuse of the dyers
with _saundus_, and other false drugs; examined divers of that trade.The Bishop of Chichester preached before the King
on Coloss.14, 15, admirably well, as he can do nothing but what is
well.Holden, preached in Whitehall
chapel, on Psalm iv.This gentleman is a very excellent and
universal scholar, a good and wise man; but he had not the popular way
of preaching, nor is in any measure fit for our plain and vulgar
auditory, as his predecessor was.There was, however, no comparison
between their parts for profound learning.But time and experience may
form him to a more practical way than that he is in of University
lectures and erudition; which is now universally left off for what is
much more profitable.I heard the speech made to the Lords in their House by
Sir Samuel Tuke, in behalf of the <DW7>s, to take off the penal laws;
and then dined with Colonel Norwood.Pearson, Bishop of Chester, preached on Hebrews
ix.14; a most incomparable sermon from one of the most learned divines
of our nation.I dined at my Lord Arlington's with the Duke and Duchess
of Monmouth; she is one of the wisest and craftiest of her sex, and has
much wit.Here was also the learned Isaac Vossius.During Lent there is constantly the most excellent preaching by the most
eminent bishops and divines of the nation.I was sworn a younger brother of the Trinity House,
with my most worthy and long-acquainted noble friend, Lord Ossory
(eldest son to the Duke of Ormond), Sir Richard Browne, my
father-in-law, being now Master of that Society; after which there was a
great collation.I carried my son to the Bishop of Chichester, that
learned and pious man, Dr.Peter Gunning, to be instructed by him before
he received the Holy Sacrament, when he gave him most excellent advice,
which I pray God may influence and remain with him as long as he lives;
and O that I had been so blessed and instructed, when first I was
admitted to that sacred ordinance!Myself and son received the blessed
Communion, it being his first time, and with that whole week's more
extraordinary preparation.I beseech God to make him a sincere and good
Christian, while I endeavor to instill into him the fear and love of
God, and discharge the duty of a father.At the sermon _coram Rege_, preached by Dr.Sparrow, Bishop of Exeter,
to a most crowded auditory; I stayed to see whether, according to
custom, the Duke of York received the Communion with the King; but he
did not, to the amazement of everybody.This being the second year he
had forborne, and put it off, and within a day of the Parliament
sitting, who had lately made so severe an Act against the increase of
Popery, gave exceeding grief and scandal to the whole nation, that the
heir of it, and the son of a martyr for the Protestant religion, should
apostatize.What the consequence of this will be, God only knows, and
wise men dread.I dined with the plenipotentiaries designed for the
treaty of Nimeguen.I carried Lady Tuke to thank the Countess of Arlington
for speaking to his Majesty in her behalf, for being one of the Queen
Consort's women.She carried us up into her new dressing room at Goring
House, where was a bed, two glasses, silver jars, and vases, cabinets,
and other so rich furniture as I had seldom seen; to this excess of
superfluity were we now arrived and that not only at Court, but almost
universally, even to wantonness and profusion.Compton, brother to the Earl of Northampton, preached on 1 Corinth.11-16, showing the Church's power in ordaining things indifferent;
this worthy person's talent is not preaching, but he is likely to make a
grave and serious good man.I saw her Majesty's rich toilet in her dressing room, being all of massy
gold, presented to her by the King, valued at L4,000.Martin's the Holy
Sacrament following, which I partook of, upon obligation of the late Act
of Parliament, enjoining everybody in office, civil or military, under
penalty of L500, to receive it within one month before two authentic
witnesses; being engrossed on parchment, to be afterward produced in the
Court of Chancery, or some other Court of Record; which I did at the
Chancery bar, as being one of the Council of Plantations and Trade;
taking then also the oath of allegiance and supremacy, signing the
clause in the said Act against Transubstantiation.My son was made a younger brother of the Trinity House.The new master was Sir J. Smith, one of the Commissioners of the Navy, a
stout seaman, who had interposed and saved the Duke from perishing by a
fire ship in the late war.I carried one Withers, an ingenious shipwright, to the
King to show him some new method of building.I saw the Italian comedy at the Court, this afternoon.Came to visit and dine with me my Lord Viscount
Cornbury and his Lady; Lady Frances Hyde, sister to the Duchess of York;
and Mrs.We went, after dinner, to see
the formal and formidable camp on Blackheath, raised to invade Holland;
or, as others suspected for another design.Thence, to the Italian
glass-house at Greenwich, where glass was blown of finer metal than that
of Murano, at Venice.Came to visit us, with other ladies of rank, Mrs.Sedley,[33] daughter to Sir Charles, who was none of the most virtuous,
but a wit.[Footnote 33: The Duke of York's mistress, afterward created by him
    Countess of Dorchester.]Congratulated the new Lord Treasurer, Sir Thomas
Osborne, a gentleman with whom I had been intimately acquainted at
Paris, and who was every day at my father-in-law's house and table
there; on which account I was too confident of succeeding in his favor,
as I had done in his predecessor's; but such a friend shall I never
find, and I neglected my time, far from believing that my Lord Clifford
would have so rashly laid down his staff, as he did, to the amazement of
all the world, when it came to the test of his receiving the Communion,
which I am confident he forbore more from some promise he had entered
into to gratify the Duke, than from any prejudice to the Protestant
religion, though I found him wavering a pretty while.[Sidenote: LONDON]

23d June, 1673.To London, to accompany our Council who went in a body
to congratulate the new Lord Treasurer, no friend to it because promoted
by my Lord Arlington, whom he hated.Came visitors from Court to dine with me and see the
army still remaining encamped on Blackheath.[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th July, 1673.This evening I went to the funeral of my dear and
excellent friend, that good man and accomplished gentleman, Sir Robert
Murray, Secretary of Scotland.He was buried by order of his Majesty in
Westminster Abbey.I went to Tunbridge Wells, to visit my Lord Clifford,
late Lord Treasurer, who was there to divert his mind more than his
body; it was believed that he had so engaged himself to the Duke, that
rather than take the Test, without which he was not capable of holding
any office, he would resign that great and honorable station.This, I am
confident, grieved him to the heart, and at last broke it; for, though
he carried with him music, and people to divert him, and, when I came to
see him, lodged me in his own apartment, and would not let me go from
him, I found he was struggling in his mind; and being of a rough and
ambitious nature, he could not long brook the necessity he had brought
on himself, of submission to this conjuncture.Besides, he saw the Dutch
war, which was made much by his advice, as well as the shutting up of
the Exchequer, very unprosperous.These things his high spirit could not
support.Having stayed here two or three days, I obtained leave of my
Lord to return.In my way, I saw my Lord of Dorset's house at Knowle, near Sevenoaks, a
great old-fashioned house.To Council, where the business of transporting wool was
brought before us.I went to see the pictures of all the judges and
eminent men of the Long Robe, newly painted by Mr.Wright, and set up in
Guildhall, costing the city L1,000.Most of them are very like the
persons they represent, though I never took Wright to be any
considerable artist.I rode to Durdans, where I dined at my Lord
Berkeley's of Berkeley Castle, my old and noble friend, it being his
wedding anniversary, where I found the Duchess of Albemarle, and other
company, and returned home on that evening late.Came to visit me my Lord Chancellor, the Earl of
Shaftesbury.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th August, 1673.My Lord Clifford, being about this time returned
from Tunbridge, and preparing for Devonshire, I went to take my leave of
him at Wallingford House; he was packing up pictures, most of which were
of hunting wild beasts and vast pieces of bull-baiting, bear-baiting,
etc.I found him in his study, and restored to him several papers of
state, and others of importance, which he had furnished me with, on
engaging me to write the "History of the Holland War," with other
private letters of his acknowledgments to my Lord Arlington, who from a
private gentleman of a very noble family, but inconsiderable fortune,
had advanced him from almost nothing.The first thing was his being in
Parliament, then knighted, then made one of the Commissioners of sick
and wounded, on which occasion we sat long together; then, on the death
of Hugh Pollard, he was made Comptroller of the Household and Privy
Councillor, yet still my brother Commissioner; after the death of Lord
Fitz-Harding, Treasurer of the Household, he, by letters to Lord
Arlington, which that Lord showed me, begged of his Lordship to obtain
it for him as the very height of his ambition.These were written with
such submissions and professions of his patronage, as I had never seen
any more acknowledging.The Earl of Southampton then dying, he was made
one of the Commissioners of the Treasury.His Majesty inclining to put
it into one hand, my Lord Clifford, under pretense of making all his
interest for his patron, my Lord Arlington, cut the grass under his
feet, and procured it for himself, assuring the King that Lord Arlington
did not desire it.Indeed, my Lord Arlington protested to me that his
confidence in Lord Clifford made him so remiss and his affection to him
was so particular, that he was absolutely minded to devolve it on Lord
Clifford, all the world knowing how he himself affected ease and quiet,
now growing into years, yet little thinking of this go-by.This was the
great ingratitude Lord Clifford showed, keeping my Lord Arlington in
ignorance, continually assuring him he was pursuing his interest, which
was the Duke's into whose great favor Lord Clifford was now gotten; but
which certainly cost him the loss of all, namely, his going so
irrevocably far in his interest.For the rest, my Lord Clifford was a valiant, incorrupt gentleman,
ambitious, not covetous; generous, passionate, a most constant, sincere
friend, to me in particular, so as when he laid down his office, I was
at the end of all my hopes and endeavors.These were not for high
matters, but to obtain what his Majesty was really indebted to my
father-in-law, which was the utmost of my ambition, and which I had
undoubtedly obtained, if this friend had stood.Sir Thomas Osborn, who
succeeded him, though much more obliged to my father-in-law and his
family, and my long and old acquaintance, being of a more haughty and
far less obliging nature, I could hope for little; a man of excellent
natural parts; but nothing of generous or grateful.Taking leave of my Lord Clifford, he wrung me by the hand, and, looking
earnestly on me, bid me God-b'ye, adding, "Mr.Evelyn, I shall never see
thee more."said I, "my Lord, what's the meaning of this?I hope I
shall see you often, and as great a person again."Evelyn, do
not expect it, I will never see this place, this city, or Court again,"
or words of this sound.In this manner, not without almost mutual tears,
I parted from him; nor was it long after, but the news was that he was
dead, and I have heard from some who I believe knew, he made himself
away, after an extraordinary melancholy.This is not confidently
affirmed, but a servant who lived in the house, and afterward with Sir
Robert Clayton, Lord Mayor, did, as well as others, report it, and when
I hinted some such thing to Mr.Prideaux, one of his trustees, he was
not willing to enter into that discourse.It was reported with these particulars, that, causing his servant to
leave him unusually one morning, locking himself in, he strangled
himself with his cravat upon the bed-tester; his servant, not liking the
manner of dismissing him, and looking through the keyhole (as I
remember), and seeing his master hanging, broke in before he was quite
dead, and taking him down, vomiting a great deal of blood, he was heard
to utter these words: "Well; let men say what they will, there is a God,
a just God above"; after which he spoke no more.This, if true, is
dismal.Really, he was the chief occasion of the Dutch war, and of all
that blood which was lost at Bergen in attacking the Smyrna fleet, and
that whole quarrel.This leads me to call to mind what my Lord Chancellor Shaftesbury
affirmed, not to me only, but to all my brethren the Council of Foreign
Plantations, when not long after, this accident being mentioned as we
were one day sitting in Council, his Lordship told us this remarkable
passage: that, being one day discoursing with him when he was only Sir
Thomas Clifford, speaking of men's advancement to great charges in the
nation, "Well," says he, "my Lord, I shall be one of the greatest men in
England.Don't impute what I say either to fancy, or vanity; I am
certain that I shall be a mighty man; but it will not last long; I shall
not hold it, but die a bloody death.""What," says my Lord, "your
horoscope tells you so?""No matter for that, it will be as I tell you.""Well," says my Lord Chancellor Shaftesbury, "if I were of that opinion,
I either would not be a great man, but decline preferment, or prevent my
danger."This my Lord affirmed in my hearing before several gentlemen and
noblemen sitting in council at Whitehall.And I the rather am confident
of it, remembering what Sir Edward Walker (Garter King-at-Arms) had
likewise affirmed to me a long time before, even when he was first made
a Lord; that carrying his pedigree to Lord Clifford on his being created
a peer, and, finding him busy, he bade him go into his study and divert
himself there till he was at leisure to discourse with him about some
things relating to his family; there lay, said Sir Edward, on his table,
his horoscope and nativity calculated, with some writing under it, where
he read that he should be advanced to the highest degree in the state
that could be conferred upon him, but that he should not long enjoy it,
but should die, or expressions to that sense; and I think, (but cannot
confidently say) a bloody death.This Sir Edward affirmed both to me and
Sir Richard Browne; nor could I forbear to note this extraordinary
passage in these memoirs.Creighton, son to the late eloquent Bishop of
Bath and Wells, preached to the Household on Isaiah, lvii.I procured L4,000 of the Lords of the Treasury,
and rectified divers matters about the sick and wounded.Bernard
Grenville, at Abs Court in Surrey; an old house in a pretty park.I went to see Paradise, a room in Hatton Garden
furnished with a representation of all sorts of animals handsomely
painted on boards or cloth, and so cut out and made to stand, move, fly,
crawl, roar, and make their several cries.The man who showed it, made
us laugh heartily at his formal poetry.To Council, about sending succors to recover New
York: and then we read the commission and instructions to Sir Jonathan
Atkins, the new Governor of Barbadoes.This night the youths of the city burned the Pope in
effigy, after they had made procession with it in great triumph, they
being displeased at the Duke for altering his religion and marrying an
Italian lady.Andrew's day I first saw the new Duchess of
York, and the Duchess of Modena, her mother.[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st December, 1673.To Gresham College, whither the city had invited the
Royal Society by many of their chief aldermen and magistrates, who gave
us a collation, to welcome us to our first place of assembly, from
whence we had been driven to give place to the City, on their making it
their Exchange on the dreadful conflagration, till their new Exchange
was finished, which it now was.The Society having till now been
entertained and having met at Arundel House.I dined with some friends, and visited the sick;
thence, to an almshouse, where was prayers and relief, some very ill and
miserable.It was one of the best days I ever spent in my life.There was at dinner my Lord Lockhart, designed
Ambassador for France, a gallant and sober person.I saw again the Italian Duchess and her brother, the
Prince Reynaldo.I had some discourse with certain strangers, not
unlearned, who had been born not far from Old Nineveh; they assured me
of the ruins being still extant, and vast and wonderful were the
buildings, vaults, pillars, and magnificent fragments;[34] but they
could say little of the Tower of Babel that satisfied me.But the
description of the amenity and fragrancy of the country for health and
cheerfulness, delighted me; so sensibly they spoke of the excellent air
and climate in respect of our cloudy and splenetic country.[Footnote 34: The remarkable discoveries of Mr.Layard give now a
    curious interest to this notice by Evelyn.]Visited the prisoners at Ludgate, taking orders
about the releasing of some.I gave Almighty God thanks for his infinite
goodness to me the year past, and begged his mercy and protection the
year following; afterward, invited my neighbors to spend the day with
me.I saw an Italian opera in music, the first that
had been in England of this kind.Sent for by his Majesty to write something against
the Hollanders about the duty of the Flag and Fishery.I dined at Knightsbridge, with the Bishops of
Salisbury, Chester, and Lincoln, my old friends.Demalhoy,
Roger L'Estrange, and several of my friends, came to dine with me on the
happy occasion.Dryden, the famous poet and now laureate, came to
give me a visit.It was the anniversary of my marriage, and the first
day I went into my new little cell and cabinet, which I built below
toward the south court, at the east end of the parlor.Jacombe's son's share in
the mill and land at Deptford, which I bought of the Beechers.I went to Windsor with my wife and son to see my
daughter Mary, who was there with my Lady Tuke and to do my duty to his
Majesty.Next day, to a great entertainment at Sir Robert Holmes's at
Cranbourne Lodge, in the Forest; there were his Majesty, the Queen,
Duke, Duchess, and all the Court.I returned in the evening with Sir
Joseph Williamson, now declared Secretary of State.He was son of a poor
clergyman somewhere in Cumberland, brought up at Queen's College,
Oxford, of which he came to be a fellow; then traveled with... and
returning when the King was restored, was received as a clerk under Mr.Sir Henry Bennett (now Lord Arlington) succeeding,
Williamson is transferred to him, who loving his ease more than business
(though sufficiently able had he applied himself to it) remitted all to
his man Williamson; and, in a short time, let him so into the secret of
affairs, that (as his Lordship himself told me) there was a kind of
necessity to advance him; and so, by his subtlety, dexterity, and
insinuation, he got now to be principal Secretary; absolutely Lord
Arlington's creature, and ungrateful enough.It has been the fate of
this obliging favorite to advance those who soon forgot their original.Sir Joseph was a musician, could play at _Jeu de Goblets_, exceedingly
formal, a severe master to his servants, but so inward with my Lord
O'Brien, that after a few months of that gentleman's death, he married
his widow,[35] who, being sister and heir of the Duke of Richmond,
brought him a noble fortune.It was thought they lived not so kindly
after marriage as they did before.She was much censured for marrying so
meanly, being herself allied to the Royal family.[Footnote 35: Lady Catherine Stuart, sister and heir to Charles
    Stuart, Duke of Richmond and Lennox, the husband of Mrs.Frances
    Stuart, one of the most admired beauties of the Court, with whom
    Charles II.was so deeply in love that he never forgave the Duke for
    marrying her, having already, it is thought, formed some similar
    intention himself.He took the first opportunity of sending the Duke
    into an honorable exile, as Ambassador to Denmark, where he shortly
    after died, leaving no issue by the Duchess.][Sidenote: GROOMBRIDGE]

6th August, 1674.I went to Groombridge, to see my old friend, Mr.Packer; the house built within a moat, in a woody valley.The old house
had been the place of confinement of the Duke of Orleans, taken by one
Waller (whose house it then was) at the battle of Agincourt, now
demolished, and a new one built in its place, though a far better
situation had been on the south of the wood, on a graceful ascent.At
some small distance, is a large chapel, not long since built by Mr.Packer's father, on a vow he made to do it on the return of King Charles
I. out of Spain, 1625, and dedicated to St.Charles, but what saint
there was then of that name I am to seek, for, being a Protestant, I
conceive it was not Borromeo.I went to see my farm at Ripe, near Lewes.His Majesty told me how exceedingly the Dutch were
displeased at my treatise of the "History of Commerce;" that the Holland
Ambassador had complained to him of what I had touched of the Flags and
Fishery, etc., and desired the book might be called in; while on the
other side, he assured me he was exceedingly pleased with what I had
done, and gave me many thanks.However, it being just upon conclusion of
the treaty of Breda (indeed it was designed to have been published some
months before and when we were at defiance), his Majesty told me he must
recall it formally; but gave order that what copies should be publicly
seized to pacify the Ambassador, should immediately be restored to the
printer, and that neither he nor the vender should be molested.The
truth is, that which touched the Hollander was much less than what the
King himself furnished me with, and obliged me to publish, having caused
it to be read to him before it went to press; but the error was, it
should have been published before the peace was proclaimed.The noise of
this book's suppression made it presently to be bought up, and turned
much to the stationer's advantage.It was no other than the preface
prepared to be prefixed to my "History of the Whole War;" which I now
pursued no further.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st August, 1674.In one of the meadows at the foot of the long
Terrace below the Castle [Windsor], works were thrown up to show the
King a representation of the city of Maestricht, newly taken by the
French.Bastians, bulwarks, ramparts, palisadoes, graffs, horn-works,
counter-scarps, etc., were constructed.It was attacked by the Duke of
Monmouth (newly come from the real siege) and the Duke of York, with a
little army, to show their skill in tactics.On Saturday night they made
their approaches, opened trenches, raised batteries, took the
counter-scarp and ravelin, after a stout defense; great guns fired on
both sides, grenadoes shot, mines sprung, parties sent out, attempts of
raising the siege, prisoners taken, parleys; and, in short, all the
circumstances of a formal siege, to appearance, and, what is most
strange all without disorder, or ill accident, to the great satisfaction
of a thousand spectators.The
siege being over, I went with Mr.Pepys back to London, where we arrived
about three in the morning.To Council, about fetching away the English left
at Surinam, etc., since our reconciliation with Holland.I went to see the great loss that Lord Arlington
had sustained by fire at Goring House, this night consumed to the
ground, with exceeding loss of hangings, plate, rare pictures, and
cabinets; hardly anything was saved of the best and most princely
furniture that any subject had in England.My lord and lady were both
absent at the Bath.The Lord Chief Baron Turner, and Sergeant Wild,
Recorder of London, came to visit me.At Lord Berkeley's, I discoursed with Sir Thomas
Modiford, late Governor of Jamaica, and with Colonel Morgan, who
undertook that gallant exploit from Nombre de Dios to Panama, on the
Continent of America; he told me 10,000 men would easily conquer all the
Spanish Indies, they were so secure.They took great booty, and much
greater had been taken, had they not been betrayed and so discovered
before their approach, by which the Spaniards had time to carry their
vast treasure on board ships that put off to sea in sight of our men,
who had no boats to follow.They set fire to Panama, and ravaged the
country sixty miles about.The Spaniards were so supine and unexercised,
that they were afraid to fire a great gun.My birthday, 54th year of my life.It was also preparation day for the Holy Sacrament, in which I
participated the next day, imploring God's protection for the year
following, and confirming my resolutions of a more holy life, even upon
the Holy Book.The anniversary of my baptism: I first heard that
famous and excellent preacher, Dr.Burnet, author of the "History of the
Reformation" on Colossians iii.10, with such flow of eloquence and
fullness of matter, as showed him to be a person oL extraordinary parts.Being her Majesty's birthday, the Court was exceeding splendid in
clothes and jewels, to the height of excess.To Council, on the business of Surinam, where the
Dutch had detained some English in prison, ever since the first war,
1665.I heard that stupendous violin, Signor Nicholao
(with other rare musicians), whom I never heard mortal man exceed on
that instrument.He had a stroke so sweet, and made it speak like the
voice of a man, and, when he pleased, like a concert of several
instruments.He did wonders upon a note, and was an excellent composer.Here was also that rare lutanist, Dr.Wallgrave; but nothing approached
the violin in Nicholao's hand.He played such ravishing things as
astonished us all.Slingsby's, master of the mint, my worthy
friend, a great lover of music.Heard Signor Francisco on the
harpsichord, esteemed one of the most excellent masters in Europe on
that instrument; then, came Nicholao with his violin, and struck all
mute, but Mrs.Knight, who sung incomparably, and doubtless has the
greatest reach of any English woman; she had been lately roaming in
Italy, and was much improved in that quality.Saw a comedy at night, at Court, acted by the
ladies only, among them Lady Mary and Ann, his Royal Highness' two
daughters, and my dear friend Mrs.Blagg, who, having the principal
part, performed it to admiration.Was at the repetition of the "Pastoral," on which
occasion Mrs.Blagg had about her near L20,000 worth of jewels, of which
she lost one worth about L80, borrowed of the Countess of Suffolk.The
press was so great, that it is a wonder she lost no more.Streeter, that excellent painter
of perspective and landscape, to comfort and encourage him to be cut for
the stone, with which that honest man was exceedingly afflicted.[Sidenote: LONDON]

22d March, 1675.Supped at Sir William Petty's, with the Bishop of
Salisbury, and divers honorable persons.We had a noble entertainment in
a house gloriously furnished; the master and mistress of it were
extraordinary persons.Sir William was the son of a mean man somewhere
in Sussex, and sent from school to Oxford, where he studied Philosophy,
but was most eminent in Mathematics and Mechanics; proceeded Doctor of
Physic, and was grown famous, as for his learning so for his recovering
a poor wench that had been hanged for felony; and her body having been
begged (as the custom is) for the anatomy lecture, he bled her, put her
to bed to a warm woman, and, with spirits and other means, restored her
to life.The young scholars joined and made a little portion, and
married her to a man who had several children by her, she living fifteen
years after, as I have been assured.Sir William came from Oxford to be
tutor to a neighbor of mine; thence, when the rebels were dividing their
conquests in Ireland, he was employed by them to measure and set out the
land, which he did on an easy contract, so much per acre.This he
effected so exactly, that it not only furnished him with a great sum of
money; but enabled him to purchase an estate worth L4,000 a year.He
afterward married the daughter of Sir Hardress Waller; she was an
extraordinary wit as well as beauty, and a prudent woman.Sir William, among other inventions, was author of the double-bottomed
ship, which perished, and he was censured for rashness, being lost in
the Bay of Biscay in a storm, when, I think, fifteen other vessels
miscarried.This vessel was flat-bottomed, of exceeding use to put into
shallow ports, and ride over small depths of water.It consisted of two
distinct keels cramped together with huge timbers, etc., so as that a
violent stream ran between; it bore a monstrous broad sail, and he still
persists that it is practicable, and of exceeding use; and he has often
told me he would adventure himself in such another, could he procure
sailors, and his Majesty's permission to make a second Experiment; which
name the King gave the vessel at the launching.The Map of Ireland made by Sir William Petty is believed to be the most
exact that ever yet was made of any country.He did promise to publish
it; and I am told it has cost him near L1,000 to have it engraved at
Amsterdam.There is not a better Latin poet living, when he gives
himself that diversion; nor is his excellence less in Council and
prudent matters of state; but he is so exceedingly nice in sifting and
examining all possible contingencies, that he adventures at nothing
which is not demonstration.There was not in the whole world his equal
for a superintendent of manufacture and improvement of trade, or to
govern a plantation.If I were a Prince, I should make him my second
Counsellor, at least.He is, besides,
courageous; on which account, I cannot but note a true story of him,
that when Sir Aleyn Brodrick sent him a challenge upon a difference
between them in Ireland, Sir William, though exceedingly purblind,
accepted the challenge, and it being his part to propound the weapon,
desired his antagonist to meet him with a hatchet, or axe, in a dark
cellar; which the other, of course, refused.Sir William was, with all this, facetious and of easy conversation,
friendly and courteous, and had such a faculty of imitating others, that
he would take a text and preach, now like a grave orthodox divine, then
falling into the Presbyterian way, then to the fanatical, the Quaker,
the monk and friar, the Popish priest, with such admirable action, and
alteration of voice and tone, as it was not possible to abstain from
wonder, and one would swear to hear several persons, or forbear to think
he was not in good earnest an enthusiast and almost beside himself;
then, he would fall out of it into a serious discourse; but it was very
rarely he would be prevailed on to oblige the company with this faculty,
and that only among most intimate friends.My Lord Duke of Ormond once
obtained it of him, and was almost ravished with admiration; but by and
by, he fell upon a serious reprimand of the faults and miscarriages of
some Princes and Governors, which, though he named none, did so sensibly
touch the Duke, who was then Lieutenant of Ireland, that he began to be
very uneasy, and wished the spirit laid which he had raised, for he was
neither able to endure such truths, nor could he but be delighted.At
last, he melted his discourse to a ridiculous subject, and came down
from the joint stool on which he had stood; but my lord would not have
him preach any more.He never could get favor at Court, because he
outwitted all the projectors that came near him.Having never known such
another genius, I cannot but mention these particulars, among a
multitude of others which I could produce.When I, who knew him in mean
circumstances, have been in his splendid palace, he would himself be in
admiration how he arrived at it; nor was it his value or inclination for
splendid furniture and the curiosities of the age, but his elegant lady
could endure nothing mean, or that was not magnificent.He was very
negligent himself, and rather so of his person, and of a philosophic
temper.would he say, "I can lie in straw with
as much satisfaction."He is author of the ingenious deductions from the bills of mortality,
which go under the name of Mr.Graunt; also of that useful discourse of
the manufacture of wool, and several others in the register of the Royal
Society.He was also author of that paraphrase on the 104th Psalm in
Latin verse, which goes about in MS., and is inimitable.In a word,
there is nothing impenetrable to him.Brideoak was elected Bishop of Chichester, on the
translation of Dr.3, the necessity
of those who are baptized to die to sin; a very excellent discourse from
an excellent preacher.Barrow, that excellent, pious, and most learned
man, divine, mathematician, poet, traveler, and most humble person,
preached at Whitehall to the household, on Luke xx.27, of love and
charity to our neighbors.I read my first discourse, "Of Earth and Vegetation,"
before the Royal Society as a lecture in course, after Sir Robert
Southwell had read his, the week before, "On Water."I was commanded by
our President and the suffrage of the Society, to print it.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th May, 1675.Blagg, married at the
Temple Church to my friend, Mr.Sidney Godolphin, Groom of the
Bedchamber to his Majesty.Bathurst, a Spanish merchant, my
neighbor.I went with Lord Ossory to Deptford, where we chose him
Master of the Trinity Company.I was at a conference of the Lords and Commons in the
Painted Chamber, on a difference about imprisoning some of their
members; and on the 3d, at another conference, when the Lords accused
the Commons for their transcendent misbehavior, breach of privilege,
Magna Charta, subversion of government, and other high, provoking, and
diminishing expressions, showing what duties and subjection they owed to
the Lords in Parliament, by record of Henry IV.This was likely to
create a notable disturbance.This afternoon came Monsieur Querouaille and his lady,
parents to the famous beauty and... favorite at Court, to see Sir R.
Browne, with whom they were intimately acquainted in Bretagne, at the
time Sir Richard was sent to Brest to supervise his Majesty's sea
affairs, during the latter part of the King's banishment.This
gentleman's house was not a mile from Brest; Sir Richard made an
acquaintance there, and, being used very civilly, was obliged to return
it here, which we did.He seemed a soldierly person and a good fellow,
as the Bretons generally are; his lady had been very handsome, and
seemed a shrewd understanding woman.Conversing with him in our garden,
I found several words of the Breton language the same with our Welsh.His daughter was now made Duchess of Portsmouth, and in the height of
favor; but he never made any use of it.At Ely House, I went to the consecration of my worthy
friend, the learned Dr.Barlow, Warden of Queen's College, Oxford, now
made Bishop of Lincoln.After it succeeded a magnificent feast, where
were the Duke of Ormond, Earl of Lauderdale, the Lord Treasurer, Lord
Keeper, etc.Howard and her two daughters toward
Northampton Assizes, about a trial at law, in which I was concerned for
them as a trustee.We lay this night at Henley-on-the Thames, at our
attorney, Mr.Stephens's, who entertained us very handsomely.Next day,
dining at Shotover, at Sir Timothy Tyrill's, a sweet place, we lay at
Oxford, where it was the time of the Act.Robert Spencer, uncle to
the Earl of Sunderland, and my old acquaintance in France, entertained
us at his apartment in Christ Church with exceeding generosity.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th July, 1675.Bathurst (who had formerly
taken particular care of my son), President of Trinity College invited
me to dinner, and did me great honor all the time of my stay.The next
day, he invited me and all my company, though strangers to him, to a
very noble feast.I was at all the academic exercises.--Sunday, at St.Mary's, preached a Fellow of Brasen-nose, not a little magnifying the
dignity of Churchmen.We heard the speeches, and saw the ceremony of creating
doctors in Divinity, Law and Physic.I had, early in the morning, heard
Dr.Morison, Botanic Professor, read on divers plants in the Physic
Garden; and saw that rare collection of natural curiosities of Dr.Plot's, of Magdalen Hall, author of "The Natural History of
Oxfordshire," all of them collected in that shire, and indeed
extraordinary, that in one county there should be found such variety of
plants, shells, stones, minerals, marcasites, fowls, insects, models of
works, crystals, agates, and marbles.He was now intending to visit
Staffordshire, and, as he had of Oxfordshire, to give us the natural,
topical, political, and mechanical history.Pity it is that more of this
industrious man's genius were not employed so to describe every county
of England; it would be one of the most useful and illustrious works
that was ever produced in any age or nation.I visited also the Bodleian Library and my old friend, the learned
Obadiah Walker, head of University College, which he had now almost
rebuilt, or repaired.We then proceeded to Northampton, where we arrived
the next day.In this journey, went part of the way Mr.James Graham (since Privy
Purse to the Duke), a young gentleman exceedingly in love with Mrs.Dorothy Howard, one of the maids of honor in our company.I could not
but pity them both, the mother not much favoring it.This lady was not
only a great beauty, but a most virtuous and excellent creature, and
worthy to have been wife to the best of men.My advice was required, and
I spoke to the advantage of the young gentleman, more out of pity than
that she deserved no better match; for, though he was a gentleman of
good family, yet there was great inequality.I went to see my Lord Sunderland's Seat at Althorpe,
four miles from the ragged town of Northampton (since burned, and well
rebuilt).It is placed in a pretty open bottom, very finely watered and
flanked with stately woods and groves in a park, with a canal, but the
water is not running, which is a defect.The house, a kind of modern
building, of freestone, within most nobly furnished; the apartments very
commodious, a gallery and noble hall; but the kitchen being in the body
of the house, and chapel too small, were defects.There is an old yet
honorable gatehouse standing awry, and out-housing mean, but designed to
be taken away.It was moated round, after the old manner, but it is now
dry, and turfed with a beautiful carpet.Above all, are admirable and
magnificent the several ample gardens furnished with the choicest fruit,
and exquisitely kept.Great plenty of oranges, and other curiosities.The park full of fowl, especially herons, and from it a prospect to
Holmby House, which being demolished in the late civil wars, shows like
a Roman ruin shaded by the trees about it, a stately, solemn, and
pleasing view.Our cause was pleaded in behalf of the mother, Mrs.Howard and her daughters, before Baron Thurland, who had formerly been
steward of Courts for me; we carried our cause, as there was reason, for
here was an impudent as well as disobedient son against his mother, by
instigation, doubtless, of his wife, one Mrs.Ogle (an ancient maid),
whom he had clandestinely married, and who brought him no fortune, he
being heir-apparent to the Earl of Berkshire.We lay at Brickhill, in
Bedfordshire, and came late the next day to our journey's end.This was a journey of adventures and knight-errantry.One of the lady's
servants being as desperately in love with Mrs.Graham was with her daughter, and she riding on horseback behind his
rival, the amorous and jealous youth having a little drink in his pate,
had here killed himself had he not been prevented; for, alighting from
his horse, and drawing his sword, he endeavored twice or thrice to fall
on it, but was interrupted by our coachman, and a stranger passing by.After this, running to his rival, and snatching his sword from his side
(for we had beaten his own out of his hand), and on the sudden pulling
down his mistress, would have run both of them through; we parted them,
not without some blood.This miserable creature poisoned himself for her
not many days after they came to London.[Sidenote: LONDON]

19th July, 1675.The Lord Treasurer's Chaplain preached at Wallingford
House.Sprat, prebend of Westminster, and Chaplain to the
Duke of Buckingham, preached on the 3d Epistle of Jude, showing what the
primitive faith was, how near it and how excellent that of the Church of
England, also the danger of departing from it.I visited the Bishop of Rochester, at Bromley, and
dined at Sir Philip Warwick's, at Frogpoole [Frognall].I went to see Dulwich College, being the pious
foundation of one Alleyn, a famous comedian, in King James's time.The
chapel is pretty, the rest of the hospital very ill contrived; it yet
maintains divers poor of both sexes.It is in a melancholy part of
Camberwell parish.I came back by certain medicinal Spa waters, at a
place called Sydenham Wells, in Lewisham parish, much frequented in
summer.I was casually shown the Duchess of Portsmouth's
splendid apartment at Whitehall, luxuriously furnished, and with ten
times the richness and glory beyond the Queen's; such massy pieces of
plate, whole tables, and stands of incredible value.I saw the Italian Scaramuccio act before the King
at Whitehall, people giving money to come in, which was very scandalous,
and never so before at Court diversions.Having seen him act before in
Italy, many years past, I was not averse from seeing the most excellent
of that kind of folly.Dined at Kensington with my old acquaintance, Mr.Henshaw, newly returned from Denmark, where he had been left resident
after the death of the Duke of Richmond, who died there Ambassador.I got an extreme cold, such as was afterward so
epidemical, as not only to afflict us in this island, but was rife over
all Europe, like a plague.It was after an exceedingly dry summer and
autumn.I settled affairs, my son being to go into France with my Lord Berkeley,
designed Ambassador-extraordinary for France and Plenipotentiary for the
general treaty of peace at Nimeguen.Dined at Lord Chamberlain's with the Holland
Ambassador L. Duras, a valiant gentleman whom his Majesty made an
English Baron, of a cadet, and gave him his seat of Holmby, in
Northamptonshire.Lord Berkeley coming into Council, fell down in the
gallery at Whitehall, in a fit of apoplexy, and being carried into my
Lord Chamberlain's lodgings, several famous doctors were employed all
that night, and with much ado he was at last recovered to some sense, by
applying hot fire pans and spirit of amber to his head; but nothing was
found so effectual as cupping him on the shoulders.It was almost a
miraculous restoration.The next day he was carried to Berkeley House.This stopped his journey for the present, and caused my stay in town.He
had put all his affairs and his whole estate in England into my hands
during his intended absence, which though I was very unfit to undertake,
in regard of many businesses which then took me up, yet, upon the great
importunity of my lady and Mr.Godolphin (to whom I could refuse
nothing) I did take it on me.It seems when he was Deputy in Ireland,
not long before, he had been much wronged by one he left in trust with
his affairs, and therefore wished for some unmercenary friend who would
take that trouble on him; this was to receive his rents, look after his
houses and tenants, solicit supplies from the Lord Treasurer, and
correspond weekly with him, more than enough to employ any drudge in
England; but what will not friendship and love make one do?Dined at my Lord Chamberlain's, with my son.There
were the learned Isaac Vossius, and Spanhemius, son of the famous man of
Heidelberg; nor was this gentleman less learned, being a general
scholar.Among other pieces, he was author of an excellent treatise on
Medals.Being the day appointed for my Lord Ambassador to
set out, I met them with my coach at New Cross.There were with him my
Lady his wife, and my dear friend, Mrs.Godolphin, who, out of an
extraordinary friendship, would needs accompany my lady to Paris, and
stay with her some time, which was the chief inducement for permitting
my son to travel, but I knew him safe under her inspection, and in
regard my Lord himself had promised to take him into his special favor,
he having intrusted all he had to my care.Thus we set out three coaches (besides mine), three wagons, and about
forty horses.It being late, and my Lord as yet but valetudinary, we got
but to Dartford, the first day, the next to Sittingbourne.Cony, then an officer of mine for the sick
and wounded of that place, gave the ladies a handsome refreshment as we
came by his house.[Sidenote: DOVER]

12th November, 1675.We came to Canterbury: and, next morning, to Dover.There was in my Lady Ambassadress's company my Lady Hamilton, a
sprightly young lady, much in the good graces of the family, wife of
that valiant and worthy gentleman, George Hamilton, not long after slain
in the wars.She had been a maid of honor to the Duchess, and now turned
<DW7>.Being Sunday, my Lord having before delivered to me
his letter of attorney, keys, seal, and his Will, we took a solemn leave
of one another upon the beach, the coaches carrying them into the sea to
the boats, which delivered them to Captain Gunman's yacht, the "Mary."Being under sail, the castle gave them seventeen guns, which Captain
Gunman answered with eleven.Hence, I went to church, to beg a blessing
on their voyage.Being returned home, I visited Lady Mordaunt at
Parson's Green, my Lord, her son, being sick.This pious woman delivered
to me L100 to bestow as I thought fit for the release of poor prisoners,
and other charitable uses.Visited her Ladyship again, where I found the
Bishop of Winchester, whom I had long known in France; he invited me to
his house at Chelsea.Lady Sunderland gave me ten guineas, to bestow in
charities.Gunning, Bishop of Ely, preached before the
King from St.21, 22, 23, chiefly against an anonymous book,
called "Naked Truth," a famous and popular treatise against the
corruption in the Clergy, but not sound as to its quotations, supposed
to have been the Bishop of Hereford's and was answered by Dr.Turner, it
endeavoring to prove an equality of order of Bishop and Presbyter.Pritchard, Bishop of Gloucester, preached at
Whitehall, on Isaiah v.5, very allegorically, according to his manner,
yet very gravely and wittily.Povey, one of the Masters of
Requests, a nice contriver of all elegancies, and exceedingly formal.Supped with Sir J. Williamson, where were of our Society Mr.Robert
Boyle, Sir Christopher Wren, Sir William Petty, Dr.Holden, subdean of
his Majesty's Chapel, Sir James Shaen, Dr.Whistler, and our Secretary,
Mr.Sir Thomas Linch was returned from his government of
Jamaica.The Countess of Sunderland and I went by water to
Parson's Green, to visit my Lady Mordaunt, and to consult with her about
my Lord's monument.Lloyd, late Curate of Deptford, but now Bishop of
Llandaff, preached before the King, on 1 Cor.57, that though sin
subjects us to death, yet through Christ we become his conquerors.To Twickenham Park, Lord Berkeley's country seat, to
examine how the bailiffs and servants ordered matters.Brideoake, Bishop of Chichester, preached a mean
discourse for a Bishop.Fleetwood, Bishop of Worcester,
on Matt.38, of the sorrows of Christ, a deadly sorrow caused by
our sins; he was no great preacher.Dining with my Lady Sunderland, I saw a fellow swallow
a knife, and divers great pebble stones, which would make a plain
rattling one against another.The knife was in a sheath of horn.North, son of my Lord North, preached before the King, on Isaiah
liii.57, a very young but learned and excellent person.This was
the first time the Duke appeared no more in chapel, to the infinite
grief and threatened ruin of this poor nation.I had now notice that my dear friend Mrs.Godolphin, was
returning from Paris.On the 6th, she arrived to my great joy, whom I
most heartily welcomed.My wife entertained her Majesty at Deptford, for which
the Queen gave me thanks in the withdrawing room at Whitehall.The University of Oxford presented me with the "_Marmora Oxoniensia
Arundeliana_"; the Bishop of Oxford writing to desire that I would
introduce Mr.Prideaux, the editor (a young man most learned in
antiquities) to the Duke of Norfolk, to present another dedicated to his
Grace, which I did, and we dined with the Duke at Arundel House, and
supped at the Bishop of Rochester's with Isaac Vossius.I spoke to the Duke of York about my Lord Berkeley's
going to Nimeguen.Thence, to the Queen's Council at Somerset House,
about Mrs.Godolphin's lease of Spalding, in Lincolnshire.Montague's new palace, near Bloomsbury, built by Mr.Hooke, of our
Society, after the French manner.[36]

    [Footnote 36: Now the British Museum.]Returned home, and found my son returned from France;
praised be God!A chaplain of my Lord Ossory's preached,
after which we took barge to Trinity House in London.Pepys
(Secretary of the Admiralty) succeeded my Lord as Master.[Sidenote: ENFIELD]

2d June, 1676.I went with my Lord Chamberlain to see a garden, at
Enfield town; thence, to Mr.It
is a very pretty place, the house commodious, the gardens handsome, and
our entertainment very free, there being none but my Lord and myself.That which I most wondered at was, that, in the compass of twenty-five
miles, yet within fourteen of London, there is not a house, barn,
church, or building, besides three lodges.To this Lodge are three great
ponds, and some few inclosures, the rest a solitary desert, yet stored
with no less than 3,000 deer.These are pretty retreats for gentlemen,
especially for those who are studious and lovers of privacy.We returned in the evening by Hampstead, to see Lord Wotton's house and
garden (Bellsize House), built with vast expense by Mr.O'Neale, an
Irish gentleman who married Lord Wotton's mother, Lady Stanhope.The
furniture is very particular for Indian cabinets, porcelain, and other
solid and noble movables.The gallery very fine, the gardens very large,
but ill kept, yet woody and chargeable.The soil a cold weeping clay,
not answering the expense.I went to see Sir Thomas Bond's new and fine house by
Peckham; it is on a flat, but has a fine garden and prospect through the
meadows to London.Castillion, Prebend of Canterbury, preached before
the King, on John xv.Went to the funeral of Sir William Sanderson, husband
to the Mother of the Maids, and author of two large but mean histories
of King James and King Charles I. He was buried at Westminster.James's Chapel,
was christened a daughter of Dr.Leake's, the Duke's Chaplain:
godmothers were Lady Mary, daughter of the Duke of York, and the Duchess
of Monmouth: godfather, the Earl of Bath.Came to dine with me my Lord Halifax, Sir Thomas
Meeres, one of the Commissioners of the Admiralty, Sir John Clayton, Mr.Dined with Sir John Banks at his house in Lincoln's
Inn Fields, on recommending Mr.Upman to be tutor to his son going into
France.This Sir John Banks was a merchant of small beginning, but had
amassed L100,000.I dined at the Admiralty with Secretary Pepys, and
supped at the Lord Chamberlain's.Here was Captain Baker, who had been
lately on the attempt of the Northwest passage.He reported prodigious
depth of ice, blue as a sapphire, and as transparent.The thick mists
were their chief impediment, and cause of their return.I paid L1,700 to the Marquis de Sissac, which he had
lent to my Lord Berkeley, and which I heard the Marquis lost at play in
a night or two.The Dean of Chichester preached before the King, on Acts xxiv.Crichton preached the second sermon before him on Psalm xc.12, of
wisely numbering our days, and well employing our time.Dined at Captain Graham's, where I became acquainted
with Dr.Compton (brother to the Earl of Northampton), now Bishop of
London, and Mr.North, son to the Lord North, brother to the Lord
Chief-Justice and Clerk of the Closet, a most hopeful young man.The
Bishop had once been a soldier, had also traveled in Italy, and became a
most sober, grave, and excellent prelate.Supped at the Lord Chamberlain's, where also supped
the famous beauty and errant lady, the Duchess of Mazarine (all the
world knows her story), the Duke of Monmouth, Countess of Sussex (both
natural children of the King by the Duchess of Cleveland[37]), and the
Countess of Derby, a virtuous lady, daughter to my best friend, the Earl
of Ossory.[Footnote 37: Evelyn makes a slip here.The Duke of Monmouth's
    mother was, it is well known, Lucy Walters, sometimes called Mrs.Barlow, and heretofore mentioned in the "Diary."Nor is he more
    correct as to the Countess of Sussex.Lady Anne Fitzroy, as she is
    called in the Peerage books, was married to Lennard Dacre, Earl of
    Sussex, by whom she left a daughter only, who succeeded on her
    father's death to the Barony of Dacre.On the other hand, the Duke
    of Southampton, the Duke of Grafton, and the Duke of Northumberland,
    were all of them children of Charles II.by the Duchess of
    Cleveland.]Flamsted, the learned astrologer
and mathematician, whom his Majesty had established in the new
Observatory in Greenwich Park, furnished with the choicest instruments.To London, to take order about the building of a
house, or rather an apartment, which had all the conveniences of a
house, for my dear friend, Mr.Godolphin and lady, which I undertook to
contrive and survey, and employ workmen until it should be quite
finished; it being just over against his Majesty's wood-yard by the
Thames side, leading to Scotland Yard.To Lambeth, to that rare magazine of marble, to
take order for chimney-pieces, etc., for Mr.The
owner of the works had built for himself a pretty dwelling house; this
Dutchman had contracted with the Genoese for all their marble.We also
saw the Duke of Buckingham's glasswork, where they made huge vases of
metal as clear, ponderous, and thick as crystal; also looking-glasses
far larger and better than any that come from Venice.Godolphin and my wife to Blackwall,
to see some Indian curiosities; the streets being slippery, I fell
against a piece of timber with such violence that I could not speak nor
fetch my breath for some space; being carried into a house and let
blood, I was removed to the water-side and so home, where, after a day's
rest, I recovered.This being one of my greatest deliverances, the Lord
Jesus make me ever mindful and thankful!Being my birthday, and fifty-six years old, I spent
the morning in devotion and imploring God's protection, with solemn
thanksgiving for all his signal mercies to me, especially for that
escape which concerned me this month at Blackwall.Godolphin, and returned home through a prodigious and dangerous mist.Finished the lease of Spalding, for Mr.My son and I dining at my Lord Chamberlain's, he
showed us among others that incomparable piece of Raphael's, being a
Minister of State dictating to Guicciardini, the earnestness of whose
face looking up in expectation of what he was next to write, is so to
the life, and so natural, as I esteem it one of the choicest pieces of
that admirable artist.There was a woman's head of Leonardo da Vinci; a
Madonna of old Palma, and two of Vandyke's, of which one was his own
picture at length, when young, in a leaning posture; the other, an
eunuch, singing.I saw the great ball danced by all the gallants and
ladies at the Duchess of York's.There fell so deep a snow as hindered us from
church.[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th December, 1676.To London, in so great a snow, as I remember not
to have seen the like.More snow falling, I was not able to get to church.I went to Roehampton, with my Lady Duchess of
Ormond.The garden and perspective is pretty, the prospect most
agreeable.Came the Earl of Peterborough, to desire me to be a
trustee for Lord Viscount Mordaunt and the Countess, for the sale of
certain lands set out by Act of Parliament, to pay debts.I went to London, to give the Lord Ambassador Berkeley
(now returned from the treaty at Nimeguen) an account of the great trust
reposed in me during his absence, I having received and remitted to him
no less than L20,000 to my no small trouble and loss of time, that
during his absence, and when the Lord Treasurer was no great friend [of
his] I yet procured him great sums, very often soliciting his Majesty in
his behalf; looking after the rest of his estates and concerns entirely,
without once accepting any kind of acknowledgment, purely upon the
request of my dear friend, Mr.I returned with abundance of
thanks and professions from my Lord Berkeley and my Lady.This business being now at an end, and myself delivered
from that intolerable servitude and correspondence, I had leisure to be
somewhat more at home and to myself.I sealed the deeds of sale of the manor of Blechingley to
Sir Robert Clayton, for payment of Lord Peterborough's debts, according
to the trust of the Act of Parliament.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

16th July, 1677.Evans, curate of Abinger,
preached an excellent sermon on Matt.Duncomb's, at Sheere, whose house stands
environed with very sweet and quick streams.Bohun, my Son's late tutor, preached at Abinger, on
Phil., iv.I went to visit my Lord Brounker, now taking the
waters at Dulwich.Dined at the Earl of Peterborough's the day after the
marriage of my Lord of Arundel to Lady Mary Mordaunt, daughter of the
Earl of Peterborough.To visit my Lord Chamberlain, in Suffolk; he sent his
coach and six to meet and bring me from St.Edmund's Bury to Euston.We hunted in the Park and killed a very fat buck.I went to visit my Lord Crofts, now dying at St.Edmunds Bury, and took the opportunity to see this ancient town, and the
remains of that famous monastery and abbey.There is little standing
entire, save the gatehouse; it has been a vast and magnificent Gothic
structure, and of great extent.The gates are wood, but quite plated
over with iron.There are also two stately churches, one especially.I went to Thetford, to the borough-town, where
stand the ruins of a religious house: there is a round mountain
artificially raised, either for some castle, or monument, which makes a
pretty landscape.As we went and returned, a tumbler showed his
extraordinary address in the Warren.I also saw the Decoy; much pleased
with the stratagem.There dined this day at my Lord's one Sir John
Gaudy, a very handsome person, but quite dumb, yet very intelligent by
signs, and a very fine painter; he was so civil and well bred, as it was
not possible to discern any imperfection in him.His lady and children
were also there, and he was at church in the morning with us.A stranger preached at Euston Church, and fell into
a handsome panegyric on my Lord's new building the church, which indeed
for its elegance and cheerfulness, is one of the prettiest country
churches in England.My Lord told me his heart smote him that, after he
had bestowed so much on his magnificent palace there, he should see
God's House in the ruin it lay in.He has also rebuilt the
parsonage-house, all of stone, very neat and ample.[Sidenote: EUSTON]

10th September, 1677.To divert me, my Lord would needs carry me to see
Ipswich, when we dined with one Mr.Mann by the way, who was Recorder of
the town.There were in our company my Lord Huntingtower, son to the
Duchess of Lauderdale, Sir Edward Bacon, a learned gentleman of the
family of the great Chancellor Verulam, and Sir John Felton, with some
other knights and gentlemen.After dinner came the bailiff and
magistrates in their formalities with their maces to compliment my Lord,
and invite him to the town-house, where they presented us a collation of
dried sweetmeats and wine, the bells ringing, etc.Then, we went to see
the town, and first, the Lord Viscount Hereford's house, which stands in
a park near the town, like that at Brussels, in Flanders; the house not
great, yet pretty, especially the hall.The stews for fish succeeded one
another, and feed one the other, all paved at bottom.There is a good
picture of the blessed virgin in one of the parlors, seeming to be of
Holbein, or some good master.Then we saw the Haven, seven miles from
Harwich.The tide runs out every day, but the bedding being soft mud, it
is safe for shipping and a station.The trade of Ipswich is for the most
part Newcastle coals, with which they supply London; but it was formerly
a clothing town.There is not any beggar asks alms in the whole place, a
thing very extraordinary, so ordered by the prudence of the magistrates.It has in it fourteen or fifteen beautiful churches: in a word, it is
for building, cleanness, and good order, one of the best towns in
England.Cardinal Wolsey was a butcher's son of Ipswich, but there is
little of that magnificent Prelate's foundation here, besides a school
and I think a library, which I did not see.His intentions were to build
some great thing.We returned late to Euston, having traveled about
fifty miles this day.Since first I was at this place, I found things exceedingly improved.It is seated in a bottom between two graceful swellings, the main
building being now in the figure of a Greek II with four pavilions, two
at each corner, and a break in the front, railed and balustered at the
top, where I caused huge jars to be placed full of earth to keep them
steady upon their pedestals between the statues, which make as good a
show as if they were of stone, and, though the building be of brick, and
but two stories besides cellars and garrets covered with blue slate, yet
there is room enough for a full court, the offices and outhouses being
so ample and well disposed.The King's apartment is painted _a fresco_,
and magnificently furnished.There are many excellent pictures of the
great masters.The gallery is a pleasant, noble room; in the break, or
middle, is a billiard table, but the wainscot, being of fir, and
painted, does not please me so well as Spanish oak without paint.The
chapel is pretty, the porch descending to the gardens.The orange garden
is very fine, and leads into the greenhouse, at the end of which is a
hall to eat in, and the conservatory some hundred feet long, adorned
with maps, as the other side is with the heads of the Caesars, ill cut in
alabaster; above are several apartments for my Lord, Lady, and Duchess,
with kitchens and other offices below, in a lesser form; lodgings for
servants, all distinct for them to retire to when they please and would
be in private, and have no communication with the palace, which he tells
me he will wholly resign to his son-in-law and daughter, that charming
young creature.The canal running under my Lady's dressing room chamber window, is full
of carps and fowl, which come and are fed there.The cascade at the end
of the canal turns a cornmill that provides the family, and raises water
for the fountains and offices.To pass this canal into the opposite
meadows, Sir Samuel Morland has invented a screw bridge, which, being
turned with a key, lands you fifty feet distant at the entrance of an
ascending walk of trees, a mile in length,--as it is also on the front
into the park,--of four rows of ash trees, and reaches to the park pale,
which is nine miles in compass, and the best for riding and meeting the
game that I ever saw.There were now of red and fallow deer almost a
thousand, with good covert, but the soil barren and flying sand, in
which nothing will grow kindly.The tufts of fir, and much of the other
wood, were planted by my direction some years before.This seat is
admirably placed for field sports, hawking, hunting, or racing.The
mutton is small, but sweet.The stables hold thirty horses and four
coaches.The out-offices make two large quadrangles, so as servants
never lived with more ease and convenience; never master more civil.Strangers are attended and accommodated as at their home, in pretty
apartments furnished with all manner of conveniences and privacy.There is a library full of excellent books; bathing rooms, elaboratory,
dispensary, a decoy, and places to keep and fat fowl in.He had now in
his new church (near the garden) built a dormitory, or vault, with
several repositories, in which to bury his family.In the expense of this pious structure, the church is most laudable,
most of the houses of God in this country resembling rather stables and
thatched cottages than temples in which to serve the Most High.He has
built a lodge in the park for the keeper, which is a neat dwelling, and
might become any gentleman.The same has he done for the parson, little
deserving it for murmuring that my Lord put him some time out of his
wretched hovel, while it was building.He has also erected a fair inn at
some distance from his palace, with a bridge of stone over a river near
it, and repaired all the tenants' houses, so as there is nothing but
neatness and accommodations about his estate, which I yet think is not
above L1,500 a year.I believe he had now in his family one hundred
domestic servants.His lady (being one of the Brederode's daughters, grandchild to a
natural son of Henry Frederick, Prince of Orange) is a good-natured and
obliging woman.They love fine things, and to live easily, pompously,
and hospitably; but, with so vast expense, as plunges my Lord into debts
exceedingly.My Lord himself is given into no expensive vice but
building, and to have all things rich, polite, and princely.He never
plays, but reads much, having the Latin, French, and Spanish tongues in
perfection.He has traveled much, and is the best bred and courtly
person his Majesty has about him, so as the public Ministers more
frequent him than any of the rest of the nobility.While he was
Secretary of State and Prime Minister, he had gotten vastly, but spent
it as hastily, even before he had established a fund to maintain his
greatness; and now beginning to decline in favor (the Duke being no
great friend of his), he knows not how to retrench.He was son of a
Doctor of Laws, whom I have seen, and, being sent from Westminster
School to Oxford, with intention to be a divine, and parson of
Arlington, a village near Brentford, when Master of Arts the Rebellion
falling out, he followed the King's Army, and receiving an HONORABLE
WOUND IN THE FACE, grew into favor, and was advanced from a mean
fortune, at his Majesty's Restoration, to be an Earl and Knight of the
Garter, Lord Chamberlain of the Household, and first favorite for a long
time, during which the King married his natural son, the Duke of
Grafton, to his only daughter and heiress, as before mentioned, worthy
for her beauty and virtue of the greatest prince in Christendom.My Lord
is, besides this, a prudent and understanding person in business, and
speaks well; unfortunate yet in those he has advanced, most of them
proving ungrateful.The many obligations and civilities I have received
from this noble gentleman, extracts from me this character, and I am
sorry he is in no better circumstances.Having now passed near three weeks at Euston, to my great satisfaction,
with much difficulty he suffered me to look homeward, being very earnest
with me to stay longer; and, to engage me, would himself have carried me
to Lynn-Regis, a town of important traffic, about twenty miles beyond,
which I had never seen; as also the Traveling Sands, about ten miles
wide of Euston, that have so damaged the country, rolling from place to
place, and, like the Sands in the Deserts of Lybia, quite overwhelmed
some gentlemen's whole estates, as the relation extant in print, and
brought to our Society, describes at large.My Lord's coach conveyed me to Bury, and thence
baiting at Newmarket, stepping in at Audley-End to see that house again,
I slept at Bishop-Stortford, and, the next day, home.I was accompanied
in my journey by Major Fairfax, of a younger house of the Lord Fairfax,
a soldier, a traveler, an excellent musician, a good-natured, well-bred
gentleman.Phillips (nephew of Milton) to the
service of my Lord Chamberlain, who wanted a scholar to read to and
entertain him sometimes.With Sir Robert Clayton to Marden, an estate he had
bought lately of my kinsman, Sir John Evelyn, of Godstone, in Surrey,
which from a despicable farmhouse Sir Robert had erected into a seat
with extraordinary expense.It is in such a solitude among hills, as,
being not above sixteen miles from London, seems almost incredible, the
ways up to it are so winding and intricate.The gardens are large, and
well-walled, and the husbandry part made very convenient and perfectly
understood.The barns, the stacks of corn, the stalls for cattle, pigeon
house, etc., of most laudable example.Innumerable are the plantations
of trees, especially walnuts.The orangery and gardens are very curious.He and his lady (who is very
curious in distillery) entertained me three or four days very freely.I
earnestly suggested to him the repairing of an old desolate dilapidated
church, standing on the hill above the house, which I left him in good
disposition to do, and endow it better; there not being above four or
five houses in the parish, besides that of this prodigious rich
Scrivener.This place is exceedingly sharp in the winter, by reason of
the serpentining of the hills: and it wants running water; but the
solitude much pleased me.All the ground is so full of wild thyme,
marjoram, and other sweet plants, that it cannot be overstocked with
bees; I think he had near forty hives of that industrious insect.I went to church at Godstone, and to see old Sir
John Evelyn's DORMITORY, joining to the church, paved with marble, where
he and his Lady lie on a very stately monument at length; he in armor of
white marble.The inscription is only an account of his particular
branch of the family, on black marble.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th October, 1677.Returned to London; in the evening, I saw the Prince
of Orange, and supped with Lord Ossory.Saw again the Prince of Orange; his marriage with the
Lady Mary, eldest daughter to the Duke of York, by Mrs.Hyde, the late
Duchess, was now declared.I was all this week composing matters between old
Mrs.Howard and Sir Gabriel Sylvius, upon his long and earnest addresses
to Mrs.Anne, her second daughter, maid of honor to the Queen.Godolphin (who exceedingly loved the young lady) was most
industrious in it, out of pity to the languishing knight; so as though
there were great differences in their years, it was at last effected,
and they were married the 13th, in Henry VII.'s Chapel, by the Bishop of
Rochester, there being besides my wife and Mrs.We dined at the old lady's, and supped at
Mr.The Queen's birthday, a great ball at Court, where
the Prince of Orange and his new Princess danced.They went away, and I saw embarked my Lady Sylvius,
who went into Holland with her husband, made Hoffmaester to the Prince,
a considerable employment.We parted with great sorrow, for the great
respect and honor I bore her, a most pious and virtuous lady.Dined at the Lord Treasurer's with Prince Rupert,
Viscount Falkenburg, Earl of Bath, Lord O'Brien, Sir John Lowther, Sir
Christopher Wren, Dr.Sir Joseph Williamson, Principal Secretary of
State, was chosen President of the Royal Society, after my Lord Viscount
Brouncker had possessed the chair now sixteen years successively, and
therefore now thought fit to CHANGE, that prescription might not
prejudice.Being the first day of his taking the chair, he gave
us a magnificent supper.Carried to my Lord Treasurer an account of the Earl
of Bristol's Library, at Wimbledon, which my Lord thought of purchasing,
till I acquainted him that it was a very broken collection, consisting
much in books of judicial astrology, romances, and trifles.I gave my son an office, with instructions how to
govern his youth; I pray God give him the grace to make a right use of
it!Dined with the Duke of Norfolk, being the first
time I had seen him since the death of his elder brother, who died at
Padua in Italy, where he had resided above thirty years.The Duke had
now newly declared his marriage to his concubine, whom he promised me he
never would marry.I went with him to see the Duke of Buckingham, thence
to my Lord Sunderland, now Secretary of State, to show him that rare
piece of Vosterman's (son of old Vosterman), which was a view, or
landscape of my Lord's palace, etc., at Althorpe in Northamptonshire.Supping at my Lord Chamberlain's I had a long
discourse with the Count de Castel Mellor, lately Prime Minister in
Portugal, who, taking part with his master, King Alphonso, was banished
by his brother, Don Pedro, now Regent; but had behaved himself so
uncorruptly in all his ministry that, though he was acquitted, and his
estate restored, yet would they not suffer him to return.He is a very
intelligent and worthy gentleman.My Lord Treasurer sent for me to accompany him to
Wimbledon, which he had lately purchased of the Earl of Bristol; so
breaking fast with him privately in his chamber, I accompanied him with
two of his daughters, my Lord Conway, and Sir Bernard Gascoyne; and,
having surveyed his gardens and alterations, returned late at night.[Sidenote: LONDON]

22d February, 1678.Pierce preached at Whitehall, on 2 Thessalonians
iii.6, against our late schismatics, in a rational discourse, but a
little over-sharp, and not at all proper for the auditory there.South preached _coram Rege_, an incomparable
discourse on this text, "A wounded spirit who can bear!"Note: Now was
our Communion table placed altarwise; the church steeple, clock, and
other reparations finished.I showed Don Emmanuel de Lyra (Portugal Ambassador)
and the Count de Castel Mellor, the Repository of the Royal Society, and
the College of Physicians.I went to see new Bedlam Hospital, magnificently
built, and most sweetly placed in Moorfields, since the dreadful fire in
London.I went to Windsor with my Lord Chamberlain (the castle
now repairing with exceeding cost) to see the rare work of Verrio, an
incomparable carving of Gibbons.Returned with my Lord by Hounslow Heath, where we saw
the newly raised army encamped, designed against France, in pretense, at
least; but which gave umbrage to the Parliament.His Majesty and a world
of company were in the field, and the whole army in battalia; a very
glorious sight.Now were brought into service a new sort of soldiers,
called GRENADIERS, who were dexterous in flinging hand grenades,
everyone having a pouch full; they had furred caps with coped crowns
like Janizaries, which made them look very fierce, and some had long
hoods hanging down behind, as we picture fools.Their clothing being
likewise piebald, yellow and red.Came to dine with me my Lord Longford, Treasurer of
Ireland, nephew to that learned gentleman, my Lord Aungier, with whom I
was long since acquainted; also the Lady Stidolph, and other company.The Earl of Ossory came to take his leave of me, going
into Holland to command the English forces.I went to the Tower to try a metal at the
Assay-master's, which only proved sulphur; then saw Monsieur Rotiere,
that excellent graver belonging to the Mint, who emulates even the
ancients, in both metal and stone;[38] he was now molding a horse for
the King's statue, to be cast in silver, of a yard high.[Footnote 38: Doubtless Philip Rotiere, who introduced the figure of
    Britannia into the coinage, taking for his model the King's
    favorite, Frances Stewart, Duchess of Richmond.]Elias Ashmole's library and curiosities,
at Lambeth.He had divers MSS., but most of them astrological, to which
study he is addicted, though I believe not learned, but very
industrious, as his History of the order of the Garter proves.He showed
me a toad included in amber.The prospect from a turret is very fine, it
being so near London, and yet not discovering any house about the
country.The famous John Tradescant bequeathed his Repository to this
gentleman, who has given them to the University of Oxford, and erected a
lecture on them, over the laboratory, in imitation of the Royal Society.Godolphin was made master of the robes to the King.There was sent me L70; from whom I knew not, to be by
me distributed among poor people; I afterward found it was from that
dear friend (Mrs.Godolphin), who had frequently given me large sums to
bestow on charities.I went to Lady Mordaunt, who put L100 into my hand to
dispose of for pious uses, relief of prisoners, poor, etc.Many a sum
had she sent me on similar occasions; a blessed creature she was, and
one that loved and feared God exemplarily.[Sidenote: WEYBRIDGE]

23d August, 1678.Upon Sir Robert Reading's importunity, I went to visit
the Duke of Norfolk, at his new palace at Weybridge, where he has laid
out in building near L10,000, on a copyhold, and in a miserable, barren,
sandy place by the street side; never in my life had I seen such expense
to so small purpose.The rooms are wainscotted, and some of them richly
pargeted with cedar, yew, cypress, etc.There are some good pictures,
especially that incomparable painting of Holbein's, where the Duke of
Norfolk, Charles Brandon and Henry VIII., are dancing with the three
ladies, with most amorous countenances, and sprightly motion exquisitely
expressed.It is a thousand pities (as I told my Lord of Arundel, his
son), that that jewel should be given away.Alban's house, at
Byfleet, an old, large building.Thence, to the papermills, where I
found them making a coarse white paper.They cull the rags which are
linen for white paper, woolen for brown; then they stamp them in troughs
to a pap, with pestles, or hammers, like the powder mills, then put it
into a vessel of water, in which they dip a frame closely wired with
wire as small as a hair and as close as a weaver's reed; on this they
take up the pap, the superfluous water draining through the wire; this
they dexterously turning, shake out like a pancake on a smooth board
between two pieces of flannel, then press it between a great press, the
flannel sucking out the moisture; then, taking it out, they ply and dry
it on strings, as they dry linen in the laundry; then dip it in alum
water, lastly, polish and make it up in quires.They put some gum in the
water in which they macerate the rags.The mark we find on the sheets is
formed in the wire.Sheldon (nephew to
the late Archbishop of Canterbury), and his pretty melancholy garden; I
took notice of the largest _arbor thuyris_ I had ever seen.The place is
finely watered, and there are many curiosities of India, shown in the
house.There was at Weybridge the Duchess of Norfolk, Lord Thomas Howard (a
worthy and virtuous gentleman, with whom my son was sometime bred in
Arundel House), who was newly come from Rome, where he had been some
time; also one of the Duke's daughters, by his first lady.My Lord
leading me about the house made no scruple of showing me all the hiding
places for the Popish priests, and where they said mass, for he was no
bigoted <DW7>.He told me he never trusted them with any secret, and
used Protestants only in all businesses of importance.I went this evening with my Lord Duke to Windsor, where was a
magnificent Court, it being the first time of his Majesty's removing
thither since it was repaired.I took leave of the Duke, and dined at Mr.Henry
Bruncker's, at the Abbey of Sheene, formerly a monastery of Carthusians,
there yet remaining one of their solitary cells with a cross.Within
this ample inclosure are several pretty villas and fine gardens of the
most excellent fruits, especially Sir William Temple's (lately
Ambassador into Holland), and the Lord Lisle's, son to the Earl of
Leicester, who has divers rare pictures, above all, that of Sir Brian
Tuke's, by Holbein.After dinner I walked to Ham, to see the house and garden of the Duke of
Lauderdale, which is indeed inferior to few of the best villas in Italy
itself; the house furnished like a great Prince's; the parterres,
flower-gardens, orangeries, groves, avenues, courts, statues,
perspectives, fountains, aviaries, and all this at the banks of the
sweetest river in the world, must needs be admirable.Hence, I went to my worthy friend, Sir Henry Capel [at Kew], brother to
the Earl of Essex; it is an old timber-house; but his garden has the
choicest fruit of any plantation in England, as he is the most
industrious and understanding in it.I was called to London to wait upon the Duke of
Norfolk, who having at my sole request bestowed the Arundelian Library
on the Royal Society; sent to me to take charge of the books, and remove
them, only stipulating that I would suffer the Herald's chief officer,
Sir William Dugdale, to have such of them as concerned heraldry and the
marshal's office, books of armory and genealogies, the Duke being Earl
Marshal of England.I procured for our Society, besides printed books,
near one hundred MSS.The printed
books being of the oldest impressions, are not the less valuable; I
esteem them almost equal to MSS.Among them, are most of the Fathers,
printed at Basil, before the Jesuits abused them with their expurgatory
Indexes; there is a noble MS.Many of these books had been
presented by Popes, Cardinals, and great persons, to the Earls of
Arundel and Dukes of Norfolk; and the late magnificent Earl of Arundel
bought a noble library in Germany, which is in this collection.I should
not, for the honor I bear the family, have persuaded the Duke to part
with these, had I not seen how negligent he was of them, suffering the
priests and everybody to carry away and dispose of what they pleased; so
that abundance of rare things are irrecoverably gone.Having taken order here, I went to the Royal Society to give them an
account of what I had procured, that they might call a Council and
appoint a day to wait on the Duke to thank him for this munificent gift.[Sidenote: LONDON]

3d September, 1678.I went to London, to dine with Mrs.Godolphin, and
found her in labor; she was brought to bed of a son, who was baptized in
the chamber, by the name of Francis, the susceptors being Sir William
Godolphin (head of the family), Mr.John Hervey, Treasurer to the Queen,
and Mrs.Boscawen, sister to Sir William and the father.While I was at church came a letter from Mr.Godolphin, that my dear friend his lady was exceedingly ill, and
desiring my prayers and assistance.My wife and I took boat immediately,
and went to Whitehall, where, to my inexpressible sorrow, I found she
had been attacked with a new fever, then reigning this excessive hot
autumn, and which was so violent, that it was not thought she could last
many hours.She died in the 26th year of her age, to the
inexpressible affliction of her dear husband, and all her relations, but
of none in the world more than of myself, who lost the most excellent
and inestimable friend that ever lived.Never was a more virtuous and
inviolable friendship; never a more religious, discreet, and admirable
creature, beloved of all, admired of all, for all possible perfections
of her sex.She is gone to receive the reward of her signal charity, and
all other her Christian graces, too blessed a creature to converse with
mortals, fitted as she was, by a most holy life, to be received into the
mansions above.She was for wit, beauty, good nature, fidelity,
discretion, and all accomplishments, the most incomparable person.How
shall I ever repay the obligations to her for the infinite good offices
she did my soul by so often engaging me to make religion the terms and
tie of the friendship there was between us!She was the best wife, the
best mistress, the best friend, that ever husband had.But it is not
here that I pretend to give her character, HAVING DESIGNED TO CONSECRATE
HER WORTHY LIFE TO POSTERITY.Her husband, struck with unspeakable affliction, fell down as dead.The
King himself, and all the Court, expressed their sorrow.To the poor and
miserable, her loss was irreparable; for there was no degree but had
some obligation to her memory.So careful and provident was she to be
prepared for all possible accidents, that (as if she foresaw her end)
she received the heavenly viaticum but the Sunday before, after a most
solemn recollection.She put all her domestic concerns into the exactest
order, and left a letter directed to her husband, to be opened in case
she died in childbed, in which with the most pathetic and endearing
expressions of the most loyal and virtuous wife, she begs his kindness
to her memory might be continued by his care and esteem of those she
left behind, even to her domestic servants, to the meanest of which she
left considerable legacies, as well as to the poor.It was now seven
years since she was maid of honor to the Queen, that she regarded me as
a father, a brother, and what is more, a friend.We often prayed,
visited the sick and miserable, received, read, discoursed, and
communicated in all holy offices together.She was most dear to my wife,
and affectionate to my children.This only is my
comfort, that she is happy in Christ, and I shall shortly behold her
again.She desired to be buried in the dormitory of his family, near
three hundred miles from all her other friends.So afflicted was her
husband at this severe loss, that the entire care of her funeral was
committed to me.Having closed the eyes, and dropped a tear upon the
cheek of my dear departed friend, lovely even in death, I caused her
corpse to be embalmed and wrapped in lead, a plate of brass soldered
thereon, with an inscription, and other circumstances due to her worth,
with as much diligence and care as my grieved heart would permit me; I
then retired home for two days, which were spent in solitude and sad
reflection.She was, accordingly, carried to Godolphin, in
Cornwall, in a hearse with six horses, attended by two coaches of as
many, with about thirty of her relations and servants.There accompanied
the hearse her husband's brother, Sir William, two more of his brothers,
and three sisters; her husband was so overcome with grief, that he was
wholly unfit to travel so long a journey, till he was more composed.I
went as far as Hounslow with a sad heart; but was obliged to return upon
some indispensable affairs.The corpse was ordered to be taken out of
the hearse every night, and decently placed in the house, with tapers
about it, and her servants attending, to Cornwall; and then was
honorably interred in the parish church of Godolphin.This funeral cost
not much less than L1,000.Godolphin, I looked over and sorted his lady's papers, most of
which consisted of Prayers, Meditations, Sermon-notes, Discourses, and
Collections on several religious subjects, and many of her own happy
composing, and so pertinently digested, as if she had been all her life
a student in divinity.We found a diary of her solemn resolutions,
tending to practical virtue, with letters from select friends, all put
into exact method.It astonished us to see what she had read and
written, her youth considered.[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st October, 1678.The Parliament and the whole Nation were alarmed
about a conspiracy of some eminent <DW7>s for the destruction of the
King and introduction of Popery, discovered by one Oates and Dr.Tongue,[39] WHICH LAST I KNEW, BEING THE TRANSLATOR OF THE "Jesuits'
Morals"; I went to see and converse with him at Whitehall, with Mr.Oates, one that was lately an apostate to the church of Rome, and now
returned again with this discovery.He seemed to be a bold man, and, in
my thoughts, furiously indiscreet; but everybody believed what he said;
and it quite changed the genius and motions of the Parliament, growing
now corrupt and interested with long sitting and court practices; but,
with all this, Popery would not go down.This discovery turned them all
as one man against it, and nothing was done but to find out the depth of
this.Oates was encouraged, and everything he affirmed taken for gospel;
the truth is, the Roman Catholics were exceedingly bold and busy
everywhere, since the Duke forbore to go any longer to the chapel.[Footnote 39: Ezrael Tonge was bred in University College, Oxford,
    and being puritanically inclined, quitted the University; but in
    1648 returned, and was made a Fellow.He had the living of Pluckley,
    in Kent, which he resigned in consequence of quarrels with his
    parishioners and Quakers.In 1657, he was made fellow of the
    newly-erected College at Durham, and that being dissolved in 1660,
    he taught school at Islington.He then went with Colonel Edward
    Harley to Dunkirk, and subsequently took a small living in
    Herefordshire (Lentwardine); but quitted it for St.Mary Stayning,
    in London, which, after the fire in 1666, was united to St.These he held till his death, in 1680.He was a great
    opponent of the Roman Catholics.Wood mentions several publications
    of his, among which are, "The Jesuits Unmasked," 1678; "Jesuitical
    Aphorisms," 1678; and "The Jesuits' Morals," 1680 (1670); the two
    latter translated from the French.(Wood's "_Athenae, Oxon._" vol.Evelyn speaks of the last of these translations as
    having been executed by his desire: and it figures in a notable
    passage of Oates's testimony.Oates said, for example, "that Thomas
    Whitbread, a priest, on 13th of June, 16.did tell the rector of
    St.Omer's that a Minister of the Church of England had scandalously
    put out the 'Jesuits' Morals' in English, and had endeavored to
    render them odious, and had asked the Rector whether he thought
    Oates might know him?and the Rector called, the deponent, who heard
    these words as he stood at the chamber door, and when he went into
    the chamber of the Provincial, he asked him 'If he knew the author
    of the "Jesuits' Morals?"'deponent answered, 'His person, but not
    his name.'Whitbread then demanded, whether he would undertake to
    poison, or assassinate the author; which deponent undertook, having
    L50 reward promised him, and appointed to return to England."]Godolphin requested me to continue the trust his
wife had reposed in me, in behalf of his little son, conjuring me to
transfer the friendship I had for his dear wife, on him and his.The murder of Sir Edmondbury Godfrey, found
strangled about this time, as was manifest, by the <DW7>s, he being the
Justice of the Peace, and one who knew much of their practices, as
conversant with Coleman (a servant of the... now accused), put the
whole nation into a new ferment against them.Being the 58th of my age, required my humble
addresses to Almighty God, and that he would take off his heavy hand,
still on my family; and restore comforts to us after the death of my
excellent friend.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1678.Tillotson preached before the Commons at St.He said the <DW7>s were now arrived at that impudence, as
to deny that there ever was any such as the gunpowder-conspiracy; but he
affirmed that he himself had several letters written by Sir Everard
Digby (one of the traitors), in which he gloried that he was to suffer
for it; and that it was so contrived, that of the <DW7>s not above two
or three should have been blown up, and they, such as were not worth
saving.I never saw the Court more
brave, nor the nation in more apprehension and consternation.Coleman
and one Staly had now been tried, condemned, and executed.On this,
Oates grew so presumptuous as to accuse the Queen of intending to poison
the King; which certainly that pious and virtuous lady abhorred the
thoughts of, and Oates's circumstances made it utterly unlikely in my
opinion.He probably thought to gratify some who would have been glad
his Majesty should have married a fruitful lady; but the King was too
kind a husband to let any of these make impression on him.However,
divers of the Popish peers were sent to the Tower, accused by Oates; and
all the Roman Catholic lords were by a new Act forever excluded the
Parliament; which was a mighty blow.The King's, Queen's, and Duke's
servants, were banished, and a test to be taken by everybody who
pretended to enjoy any office of public trust, and who would not be
suspected of Popery.I went with Sir William Godolphin, a member of the
Commons' House, to the Bishop of Ely (Dr.Peter Gunning), to be resolved
whether masses were idolatry, as the text expressed it, which was so
worded, that several good Protestants scrupled, and Sir William, though
a learned man and excellent divine himself, had some doubts about it.The Bishop's opinion was that he might take it, though he wished it had
been otherwise worded in the text.I went with my Lady Sunderland to Chelsa, and
dined with the Countess of Bristol [her mother] in the great house,
formerly the Duke of Buckingham's, a spacious and excellent place for
the extent of ground and situation in a good air.The house is large but
ill-contrived, though my Lord of Bristol, who purchased it after he sold
Wimbledon to my Lord Treasurer, expended much money on it.There were
divers pictures of Titian and Vandyke, and some of Bassano, very
excellent, especially an Adonis and Venus, a Duke of Venice, a butcher
in his shambles selling meat to a Swiss; and of Vandyke, my Lord of
Bristol's picture, with the Earl of Bedford's at length, in the same
table.There was in the garden a rare collection of orange trees, of
which she was pleased to bestow some upon me.Houblon's, a French merchant, who had his house furnished _en Prince_,
and gave us a splendid entertainment.The Long Parliament, which had sat ever since the
Restoration, was dissolved by persuasion of the Lord Treasurer, though
divers of them were believed to be his pensioner.At this, all the
politicians were at a stand, they being very eager in pursuit of the
late plot of the <DW7>s.Cudworth preached before the King at Whitehall,
on 2 Timothy iii.5, reckoning up the perils of the last times, in
which, among other wickedness, treasons should be one of the greatest,
applying it to the occasion, as committed under a form of reformation
and godliness; concluding that the prophecy did intend more particularly
the present age, as one of the last times; the sins there enumerated,
more abundantly reigning than ever.[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d February, 1679.Durell, Dean of Windsor, preached to the
household at Whitehall, on 1 Cor.22; he read the whole sermon out
of his notes, which I had never before seen a Frenchman do, he being of
Jersey, and bred at Paris.Pierce, Dean of Salisbury, preached on 1 John,
iv.1, "Try the Spirits, there being so many delusory ones gone forth of
late into the world"; he inveighed against the pernicious doctrines of
Mr.My brother Evelyn, was now chosen Knight for the County of Surrey,
carrying it against my Lord Longford and Sir Adam Brown, of Bechworth
Castle.The country coming in to give him their suffrages were so many,
that I believe they ate and drank him out near L2,000, by a most
abominable custom.Godolphin, was now made one of the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury, and of the Privy Council.The Bishop of Gloucester preached in a manner very like
Bishop Andrews, full of divisions, and scholastical, and that with much
quickness.Our vicar preached exceedingly well on 1
Cor.The Holy Communion followed, at which I and my daughter, Mary
(now about fourteen years old), received for the first time.The Lord
Jesus continue his grace unto her, and improve this blessed beginning!The Duke of York, voted against by the Commons for his
recusancy, went over to Flanders; which made much discourse.Pepys in the Tower, he having been
committed by the House of Commons for misdemeanors in the Admiralty when
he was secretary; I believe he was unjustly charged.Here I saluted my
Lords Stafford and Petre, who were committed for the Popish plot.I saw the magnificent cavalcade and entry of the
Portugal Ambassador.I was godfather to a son of Sir Christopher Wren,
surveyor of his Majesty's buildings, that most excellent and learned
person, with Sir William Fermor, and my Lady Viscountess Newport, wife
of the Treasurer of the Household.Thence to Chelsea, to Sir Stephen Fox, and my lady, in order to the
purchase of the Countess of Bristol's house there, which she desired me
to procure a chapman for.I dined at Sir Robert Clayton's with Sir Robert Viner,
the great banker.There were now divers Jesuits executed about the plot,
and a rebellion in Scotland of the fanatics, so that there was a sad
prospect of public affairs.The new Commissioners of the Admiralty came to visit
me, viz, Sir Henry Capell, brother to the Earl of Essex, Mr.Finch,
eldest son to the Lord Chancellor, Sir Humphry Winch, Sir Thomas Meeres,
Mr.Hales, with some of the Commissioners of the Navy.I dined at Sir William Godolphin's, and with that
learned gentleman went to take the air in Hyde Park, where was a
glorious _cortege_.Sending a piece of venison to Mr.Pepys, still a
prisoner, I went and dined with him.Now were there papers, speeches, and libels, publicly
cried in the streets against the Dukes of York and Lauderdale, etc.,
obnoxious to the Parliament, with too much and indeed too shameful a
liberty; but the people and Parliament had gotten head by reason of the
vices of the great ones.[Sidenote: LONDON]

There was now brought up to London a child, son of one Mr.Wotton,
formerly amanuensis to Dr.Andrews, Bishop of Winton, who both read and
perfectly understood Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Arabic, Syriac, and most of
the modern languages; disputed in divinity, law, and all the sciences;
was skillful in history, both ecclesiastical and profane; in politics;
in a word, so universally and solidly learned at eleven years of age,
that he was looked on as a miracle.Lloyd, one of the most deeply
learned divines of this nation in all sorts of literature, with Dr.Burnet, who had severely examined him, came away astonished, and they
told me they did not believe there had the like appeared in the world.He had only been instructed by his father, who being himself a learned
person, confessed that his son knew all that he himself knew.But, what
was more admirable than his vast memory, was his judgment and invention,
he being tried with divers hard questions, which required maturity of
thought and experience.He was also dexterous in chronology,
antiquities, mathematics.In sum, an _intellectus universalis_, beyond
all that we read of Picus Mirandula, and other precocious wits, and yet
withal a very humble child.I went to see how things stood at Parson's Green, my
Lady Viscountess Mordaunt (now sick in Paris, whither she went for
health) having made me a trustee for her children, an office I could not
refuse to this most excellent, pious, and virtuous lady, my long
acquaintance.Sidney Godolphin, now one of the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury.I went early to the Old Bailey Sessions House, to the
famous trial of Sir George Wakeman, one of the Queen's physicians, and
three Benedictine monks; the first (whom I was well acquainted with, and
take to be a worthy gentleman abhorring such a fact), for intending to
poison the King; the others as accomplices to carry on the plot, to
subvert the government, and introduce Popery.The bench was crowded with
the judges, Lord Mayor justices, and innumerable spectators.Oates (as he called himself), and one Bedlow, a man of
inferior note.Their testimonies were not so pregnant, and I fear much
of it from hearsay, but swearing positively to some particulars, which
drew suspicion upon their truth; nor did circumstances so agree, as to
give either the bench or jury so entire satisfaction as was expected.After, therefore, a long and tedious trial of nine hours, the jury
brought them in not guilty, to the extraordinary triumph of the <DW7>s,
and without sufficient disadvantage and reflections on witnesses,
especially Oates and Bedlow.This was a happy day for the lords in the Tower, who, expecting their
trial, had this gone against the prisoners at the bar, would all have
been in the utmost hazard.For my part, I look on Oates as a vain,
insolent man, puffed up with the favor of the Commons for having
discovered something really true, more especially as detecting the
dangerous intrigue of Coleman, proved out of his own letters, and of a
general design which the Jesuited party of the <DW7>s ever had and
still have, to ruin the Church of England; but that he was trusted with
those great secrets he pretended, or had any solid ground for what he
accused divers noblemen of, I have many reasons to induce my contrary
belief.That among so many commissions as he affirmed to have delivered
to them from P. Oliva[40] and the Pope,--he who made no scruple of
opening all other papers, letters, and secrets, should not only not open
any of those pretended commissions, but not so much as take any copy or
witness of any one of them, is almost miraculous.But the Commons (some
leading persons I mean of them) had so exalted him that they took all he
said for Gospel, and without more ado ruined all whom he named to be
conspirators; nor did he spare whoever came in his way.But, indeed, the
murder of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, suspected to have been compassed by
the Jesuits' party for his intimacy with Coleman (a busy person whom I
also knew), and the fear they had that he was able to have discovered
things to their prejudice, did so exasperate not only the Commons, but
all the nation, that much of these sharpnesses against the more honest
Roman Catholics who lived peaceably, is to be imputed to that horrid
fact.Mary went back to the hallway.[Footnote 40: Padre Oliva, General of the Order of Jesuits.]The sessions ended, I dined or rather supped (so late it was) with the
judges in the large room annexed to the place, and so returned home.Though it was not my custom or delight to be often present at any
capital trials, we having them commonly so exactly published by those
who take them in short-hand, yet I was inclined to be at this signal
one, that by the ocular view of the carriages and other circumstances of
the managers and parties concerned, I might inform myself, and regulate
my opinion of a cause that had so alarmed the whole nation.Dined at Clapham, at Sir D. Gauden's; went thence with
him to Windsor, to assist him in a business with his Majesty.I lay that
night at Eton College, the Provost's lodgings (Dr.Craddock), where I
was courteously entertained.[Sidenote: LONDON]

23d July, 1679.To Court: after dinner, I visited that excellent
painter, Verrio, whose works in _fresco_ in the King's palace, at
Windsor, will celebrate his name as long as those walls last.He showed
us his pretty garden, choice flowers, and curiosities, he himself being
a skillful gardener.I went to Clifden, that stupendous natural rock, wood, and prospect, of
the Duke of Buckingham's, and buildings of extraordinary expense.The
grots in the chalky rocks are pretty: it is a romantic object, and the
place altogether answers the most poetical description that can be made
of solitude, precipice, prospect, or whatever can contribute to a thing
so very like their imaginations.The stand, somewhat like Frascati as to
its front, and on the platform is a circular view to the utmost verge of
the horizon, which, with the serpenting of the Thames, is admirable.The
staircase is for its materials singular; the cloisters, descents,
gardens, and avenue through the wood, august and stately; but the land
all about wretchedly barren, and producing nothing but fern.Indeed, as
I told his Majesty that evening (asking me how I liked Clifden) without
flattery, that it did not please me so well as Windsor for the prospect
and park, which is without compare; there being but one only opening,
and that narrow, which led one to any variety; whereas that of Windsor
is everywhere great and unconfined.Returning, I called at my cousin Evelyn's, who has a very pretty seat in
the forest, two miles by hither Clifden, on a flat, with gardens
exquisitely kept, though large, and the house a staunch good old
building, and what was singular, some of the rooms floored dove
tail-wise without a nail, exactly close.One of the closets is pargeted
with plain deal, set in diamond, exceeding staunch and pretty.Dined at the Sheriff's, when, the Company of Drapers
and their wives being invited, there was a sumptuous entertainment,
according to the forms of the city, with music, etc., comparable to any
prince's service in Europe.I went this morning to show my Lord Chamberlain, his
Lady, and the Duchess of Grafton, the incomparable work of Mr.Gibbon,
the carver, whom I first recommended to his Majesty, his house being
furnished like a cabinet, not only with his own work, but divers
excellent paintings of the best hands.Thence, to Sir Stephen Fox's,
where we spent the day.After evening service, to see a neighbor, one Mr.Bohun, related to my son's late tutor of that name, a rich Spanish
merchant, living in a neat place, which he has adorned with many
curiosities, especially several carvings of Mr.Gibbons, and some
pictures by Streeter.To Windsor, to congratulate his Majesty on his
recovery; I kissed the Duke's hand, now lately returned from
Flanders[41] to visit his brother the King, on which there were various
bold and foolish discourses, the Duke of Monmouth being sent away.[Footnote 41: He returned the day before, the 12th of September.This is another of the indications that the entries of this Diary
    were not always made on the precise days they refer to.]My Lord Sunderland, one of the principal
Secretaries of State, invited me to dinner, where was the King's natural
son, the Earl of Plymouth, the Earl of Shrewsbury, Earl of Essex, Earl
of Mulgrave, Mr.After dinner I went to prayers
at Eton, and visited Mr.Henry Godolphin, fellow there, and Dr.Slingsby and Signor Verrio came to dine with
me, to whom I gave China oranges off my own trees, as good, I think, as
were ever eaten.Dined at my Lord Chamberlain's, the King being now
newly returned from his Newmarket recreations.Dined at the Lord Mayor's; and, in the evening, went
to the funeral of my pious, dear, and ancient learned friend, Dr.Jasper
Needham, who was buried at St.He was a true and holy
Christian, and one who loved me with great affection.Dove preached
with an eulogy due to his memory.I lost in this person one of my
dearest remaining sincere friends.I was invited to dine at my Lord Teviotdale's, a
Scotch Earl, a learned and knowing nobleman.Montague's new palace near Bloomsbury, built by our curator, Mr.Hooke, somewhat after the French; it was most nobly furnished, and a
fine, but too much exposed garden.[42]

    [Footnote 42: Now the British Museum.][Sidenote: LONDON]

6th November, 1679.Dined at the Countess of Sunderland's, and was this
evening at the remarriage of the Duchess of Grafton to the Duke (his
Majesty's natural son), she being now twelve years old.The ceremony was
performed in my Lord Chamberlain's (her father's) lodgings at Whitehall
by the Bishop of Rochester, his Majesty being present.A sudden and
unexpected thing, when everybody believed the first marriage would have
come to nothing; but, the measure being determined, I was privately
invited by my Lady, her mother, to be present.I confess I could give
her little joy, and so I plainly told her, but she said the King would
have it so, and there was no going back.This sweetest, most hopeful,
most beautiful, child, and most virtuous, too, was sacrificed to a boy
that had been rudely bred, without anything to encourage them but his
Majesty's pleasure.I pray God the sweet child find it to her advantage,
who, if my augury deceive me not, will in a few years be such a paragon
as were fit to make the wife of the greatest Prince in Europe!I staid
supper, where his Majesty sat between the Duchess of Cleveland (the
mother of the Duke of Grafton) and the sweet Duchess the bride; there
were several great persons and ladies, without pomp.My love to my Lord
Arlington's family, and the sweet child made me behold all this with
regret, though as the Duke of Grafton affects the sea, to which I find
his father intends to use him, he may emerge a plain, useful and robust
officer: and were he polished, a tolerable person; for he is exceedingly
handsome, by far surpassing any of the King's other natural issue.At Sir Stephen Fox's, and was agreeing for the
Countess of Bristol's house at Chelsea, within L500.I dined at my Lord Mayor's, being desired by the
Countess of Sunderland to carry her thither on a solemn day, that she
might see the pomp and ceremony of this Prince of Citizens, there never
having been any, who for the stateliness of his palace, prodigious
feasting, and magnificence, exceeded him.This Lord Mayor's acquaintance
had been from the time of his being apprentice to one Mr.Abbot, his
uncle, who being a scrivener, and an honest worthy man, one who was
condemned to die at the beginning of the troubles forty years past, as
concerned in the commission of array for King Charles I. had escaped
with his life; I often used his assistance in money matters.Robert
Clayton, then a boy, his nephew, became, after his uncle Abbot's death,
so prodigiously rich and opulent, that he was reckoned one of the
wealthiest citizens.He married a free-hearted woman, who became his
hospitable disposition; and having no children, with the accession of
his partner and fellow apprentice, who also left him his estate, he grew
excessively rich.He was a discreet magistrate, and though envied, I
think without much cause.Some believed him guilty of hard dealing,
especially with the Duke of Buckingham, much of whose estate he had
swallowed, but I never saw any ill by him, considering the trade he was
of.The reputation and known integrity of his uncle, Abbot, brought all
the royal party to him, by which he got not only great credit, but vast
wealth, so as he passed this office with infinite magnificence and
honor.Slingsby, Master of the Mint, with
my wife, invited to hear music, which was exquisitely performed by four
of the most renowned masters: Du Prue, a Frenchman, on the lute; Signor
Bartholomeo, an Italian, on the harpsichord; Nicholao on the violin;
but, above all, for its sweetness and novelty, the _viol d'amore_ of
five wire strings played on with a bow, being but an ordinary violin,
played on lyre-way, by a German.There was also a _flute douce_, now in
much request for accompanying the voice.Slingsby, whose son and
daughter played skillfully, had these meetings frequently in his house.I dined at my Lord Mayor's, to accompany my
worthiest and generous friend, the Earl of Ossory; it was on a Friday, a
private day, but the feast and entertainment might have become a King.Such an hospitable costume and splendid magistrature does no city in the
world show, as I believe.Allestree preached before the household on St.20, before the King, showing with
how little reason the <DW7>s applied those words of our blessed Savior
to maintain the pretended infallibility they boast of.I never heard a
more Christian and excellent discourse; yet were some offended that he
seemed to say the Church of Rome was a true church; but it was a
captious mistake; for he never affirmed anything that could be more to
their reproach, and that such was the present Church of Rome, showing
how much it had erred.There was not in this sermon so much as a shadow
for censure, no person of all the clergy having testified greater zeal
against the errors of the <DW7>s than this pious and most learned
person.I dined at the Bishop of Rochester's, and then went to St.Paul's to hear that great wit, Dr.His talent was a great memory,
never making use of notes, a readiness of expression in a most pure and
plain style of words, full of matter, easily delivered.I met the Earl of Clarendon with the rest of my
fellow executors of the Will of my late Lady Viscountess Mordaunt,
namely, Mr.Laurence Hyde, one of the Commissioners of the Treasury, and
lately Plenipotentiary-Ambassador at Nimeguen; Andrew Newport; and Sir
Charles Wheeler; to examine and audit and dispose of this year's account
of the estate of this excellent Lady, according to the direction of her
Will.I went to see Sir John Stonehouse, with whom I was
treating a marriage between my son and his daughter-in-law.Came over the Duke of Monmouth from Holland
unexpectedly to his Majesty; while the Duke of York was on his journey
to Scotland, whither the King sent him to reside and govern.The bells
and bonfires of the city at this arrival of the Duke of Monmouth
publishing their joy, to the no small regret of some at Court.This
Duke, whom for distinction they called the Protestant Duke (though the
son of an abandoned woman), the people made their idol.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th December, 1679.I dined, together with Lord Ossory and the Earl of
Chesterfield, at the Portugal Ambassador's, now newly come, at Cleveland
House, a noble palace, too good for that infamous.... The staircase is
sumptuous, and the gallery and garden; but, above all, the costly
furniture belonging to the Ambassador, especially the rich Japan
cabinets, of which I think there were a dozen.There was a billiard
table, with as many more hazards as ours commonly have; the game being
only to prosecute the ball till hazarded, without passing the port, or
touching the pin; if one miss hitting the ball every time, the game is
lost, or if hazarded.It is more difficult to hazard a ball, though so
many, than in our table, by reason the bound is made so exactly even,
and the edges not stuffed; the balls are also bigger, and they for the
most part use the sharp and small end of the billiard stick, which is
shod with brass, or silver.The entertainment was exceedingly civil;
but, besides a good olio, the dishes were trifling, hashed and condited
after their way, not at all fit for an English stomach, which is for
solid meat.There was yet good fowls, but roasted to coal, nor were the
sweetmeats good.I went to meet Sir John Stonehouse, and give him a
particular of the settlement on my son, who now made his addresses to
the young lady his daughter-in-law, daughter of Lady Stonehouse.Cave, author of "Primitive Christianity,"
etc., a pious and learned man, preached at Whitehall to the household,
on James iii.17, concerning the duty of grace and charity.I supped with Sir Stephen Fox, now made one of the
Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.The writings for the settling jointure and other
contracts of marriage of my son were finished and sealed.The lady was
to bring L5,000, in consideration of a settlement of L500 a year present
maintenance, which was likewise to be her jointure, and L500 a year
after mine and my wife's decease.But, with God's blessing, it will be
at the least L1,000 a year more in a few years.I pray God make him
worthy of it, and a comfort to his excellent mother, who deserves much
from him!Martha
Spencer, daughter to my Lady Stonehouse by a former gentleman, at St.Andrew's, Holborn, by our Vicar, borrowing the church of Dr.We afterward
dined at a house in Holborn; and, after the solemnity and dancing was
done, they were bedded at Sir John Stonehouse's lodgings in Bow Street,
Convent Garden.To the Royal Society, where I met an Irish Bishop
with his Lady, who was daughter to my worthy and pious friend, Dr.Jeremy Taylor, late Bishop of Down and Connor; they came to see the
Repository.She seemed to be a knowing woman, beyond the ordinary talent
of her sex.I dined at my Lord Mayor's, in order to the meeting of
my Lady Beckford, whose daughter (a rich heiress) I had recommended to
my brother of Wotton for his only son, she being the daughter of the
lady by Mr.To London, to receive L3,000 of my daughter-in-law's
portion, which was paid in gold.The Dean of Sarum preached on Jerem.5, an hour
and a half from his common-place book, of kings and great men retiring
to private situations.[Sidenote: CASHIOBURY]

18th April, 1680.On the earnest invitation of the Earl of Essex, I went
with him to his house at Cashiobury, in Hertfordshire.It was on Sunday,
but going early from his house in the square of St.James, we arrived by
ten o'clock; this he thought too late to go to church, and we had
prayers in his chapel.The house is new, a plain fabric, built by my
friend, Mr.There are divers fair and good rooms, and
excellent carving by Gibbons, especially the chimney-piece of the
library.There is in the porch, or entrance, a painting by Verrio, of
Apollo and the Liberal Arts.One room pargeted with yew, which I liked
well.Some of the chimney mantels are of Irish marble, brought by my
Lord from Ireland, when he was Lord-Lieutenant, and not much inferior to
Italian.The tympanum, or gable, at the front is a bass-relievo of Diana
hunting, cut in Portland stone, handsomely enough.I do not approve of
the middle doors being round: but, when the hall is finished as
designed, it being an oval with a cupola, together with the other wing,
it will be a very noble palace.The library is large, and very nobly
furnished, and all the books are richly bound and gilded; but there are
no MSS., except the Parliament Rolls and Journals, the transcribing and
binding of which cost him, as he assured me, L500.No man has been more industrious than this noble Lord in planting about
his seat, adorned with walks, ponds, and other rural elegancies; but the
soil is stony, churlish, and uneven, nor is the water near enough to the
house, though a very swift and clear stream runs within a flight-shot
from it in the valley, which may fitly be called Coldbrook, it being
indeed excessively cold, yet producing fair trouts.It is a pity the
house was not situated to more advantage: but it seems it was built just
where the old one was, which I believe he only meant to repair; this
leads men into irremediable errors, and saves but a little.The land about is exceedingly addicted to wood, but the coldness of the
place hinders the growth.Black cherry trees prosper even to
considerable timber, some being eighty feet long; they make also very
handsome avenues.There is a pretty oval at the end of a fair walk, set
about with treble rows of Spanish chestnut trees.The gardens are very rare, and cannot be otherwise, having so skillful
an artist to govern them as Mr.Cooke, who is, as to the mechanic part,
not ignorant in mathematics, and pretends to astrology.There is an
excellent collection of the choicest fruit.As for my Lord, he is a sober, wise, judicious, and pondering person,
not illiterate beyond the rate of most noblemen in this age, very well
versed in English history and affairs, industrious, frugal, methodical,
and every way accomplished.His Lady (being sister of the late Earl of
Northumberland) is a wise, yet somewhat melancholy woman, setting her
heart too much on the little lady, her daughter, of whom she is over
fond.My Lord was not long since come from his Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland,
where he showed his abilities in administration and government, as well
as prudence in considerably augmenting his estate without reproach.He
had been Ambassador-extraordinary in Denmark, and, in a word, such a
person as became the son of that worthy hero his father to be, the late
Lord Capel, who lost his life for King Charles I.

We spent our time in the mornings in walking, or riding, and contriving
[alterations], and the afternoons in the library, so as I passed my time
for three or four days with much satisfaction.He was pleased in
conversation to impart to me divers particulars of state, relating to
the present times.He being no great friend to the D---- was now laid
aside, his integrity and abilities being not so suitable in this
conjuncture.To a meeting of the executors of late Viscountess
Mordaunt's estate, to consider of the sale of Parson's Green, being in
treaty with Mr.Loftus, and to settle the half year's account.Was a meeting of the feoffees of the poor of our parish.This year I would stand one of the collectors of their rents, to give
example to others.My son was added to the feoffees.This afternoon came to visit me Sir Edward Deering, of Surrendon, in
Kent, one of the Lords of the Treasury, with his daughter, married to my
worthy friend, Sir Robert Southwell, Clerk of the Council, now
Extraordinary-Envoy to the Duke of Brandenburgh, and other Princes in
Germany, as before he had been in Portugal, being a sober, wise, and
virtuous gentleman.Shish, master-shipwright
of his Majesty's Yard here, an honest and remarkable man, and his death
a public loss, for his excellent success in building ships (though
altogether illiterate), and for breeding up so many of his children to
be able artists.I held up the pall with three knights, who did him that
honor, and he was worthy of it.It was the custom of this good man to
rise in the night, and to pray, kneeling in his own coffin, which he had
lying by him for many years.He was born that famous year, the
Gunpowder-plot, 1605.Came to dine with us the Countess of Clarendon, Dr.Lloyd, Dean of Bangor (since Bishop of St.Burnet, author of
the "History of the Reformation," and my old friend, Mr.After
dinner we all went to see the Observatory, and Mr.Flamsted, who showed
us divers rare instruments, especially the great quadrant.[Sidenote: WINDSOR]

24th July, 1680.Went with my wife and daughter to Windsor, to see that
stately court, now near finished.There was erected in the court the
King on horseback, lately cast in copper, and set on a rich pedestal of
white marble, the work of Mr.Gibbons, at the expense of Toby Rustate, a
page of the back stairs, who by his wonderful frugality had arrived to a
great estate in money, and did many works of charity, as well as this of
gratitude to his master, which cost him L1,000.He is very simple,
ignorant, but honest and loyal creature.We all dined at the Countess of Sunderland's, afterward to see Signor
Verrio's garden, thence to Eton College, to salute the provost, and
heard a Latin speech of one of the alumni (it being at the election) and
were invited to supper; but took our leave, and got to London that night
in good time.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th July, 1680.My most noble and illustrious friend, the Earl of
Ossory, espying me this morning after sermon in the privy gallery,
calling to me, told me he was now going his journey (meaning to Tangier,
whither he was designed Governor, and General of the forces, to regain
the losses we had lately sustained from the Moors, when Inchiquin was
Governor).I asked if he would not call at my house (as he always did
whenever he went out of England on any exploit).He said he must embark
at Portsmouth, "wherefore let you and me dine together to-day; I am
quite alone, and have something to impart to you; I am not well, shall
be private, and desire your company."Being retired to his lodgings, and set down on a couch, he sent to his
secretary for the copy of a letter which he had written to Lord
Sunderland (Secretary of State), wishing me to read it; it was to take
notice how ill he resented it, that he should tell the King before Lord
Ossory's face, that Tangier was not to be kept, but would certainly be
lost, and yet added that it was fit Lord Ossory should be sent, that
they might give some account of it to the world, meaning (as supposed)
the next Parliament, when all such miscarriages would probably be
examined; this Lord Ossory took very ill of Lord Sunderland, and not
kindly of the King, who resolving to send him with an incompetent force,
seemed, as his Lordship took it, to be willing to cast him away, not
only on a hazardous adventure, but in most men's opinion, an
impossibility, seeing there was not to be above 300 or 400 horse, and
4,000 foot for the garrison and all, both to defend the town, form a
camp, repulse the enemy, and fortify what ground they should get in.This touched my Lord deeply, that he should be so little considered as
to put him on a business in which he should probably not only lose his
reputation, but be charged with all the miscarriage and ill success;
whereas, at first they promised 6,000 foot and 600 horse effective.My Lord, being an exceedingly brave and valiant person, and who had so
approved himself in divers signal battles, both at sea and land; so
beloved and so esteemed by the people, as one they depended on, upon all
occasions worthy of such a captain;--he looked on this as too great an
indifference in his Majesty, after all his services, and the merits of
his father, the Duke of Ormond, and a design of some who envied his
virtue.It certainly took so deep root in his mind, that he who was the
most void of fear in the world (and assured me he would go to Tangier
with ten men if his Majesty commanded him) could not bear up against
this unkindness.Having disburdened himself of this to me after dinner,
he went with his Majesty to the sheriffs at a great supper in
Fishmongers' Hall; but finding himself ill, took his leave immediately
of his Majesty, and came back to his lodging.Not resting well this
night, he was persuaded to remove to Arlington House, for better
accommodation.His disorder turned to a malignant fever, which
increasing, after all that six of the most able physicians could do, he
became delirious, with intervals of sense, during which Dr.Lloyd (after
Bishop of St.Asaph) administered the Holy Sacrament, of which I also
participated.He died the Friday following, the 30th of July, to the
universal grief of all that knew or heard of his great worth, nor had
any a greater loss than myself.Oft would he say I was the oldest
acquaintance he had in England (when his father was in Ireland), it
being now of about thirty years, contracted abroad, when he rode in the
Academy in Paris, and when we were seldom asunder.His Majesty never lost a worthier subject, nor father a better or more
dutiful son; a loving, generous, good-natured, and perfectly obliging
friend; one who had done innumerable kindnesses to several before they
knew it; nor did he ever advance any that were not worthy; no one more
brave, more modest; none more humble, sober, and every way virtuous.Unhappy England in this illustrious person's loss!Universal was the
mourning for him, and the eulogies on him; I stayed night and day by his
bedside to his last gasp, to close his dear eyes!O sad father, mother,
wife, and children!He deserved all that a sincere
friend, a brave soldier, a virtuous courtier, a loyal subject, an honest
man, a bountiful master, and good Christian, could deserve of his prince
and country.One thing more let me note, that he often expressed to me
the abhorrence he had of that base and unworthy action which he was put
upon, of engaging the Smyrna fleet in time of peace, in which though he
behaved himself like a great captain, yet he told me it was the only
blot in his life, and troubled him exceedingly.Though he was commanded,
and never examined further when he was so, yet he always spoke of it
with regret and detestation.The Countess was at the seat of her
daughter, the Countess of Derby, about 200 miles off.I went to visit a French gentleman, one Monsieur
Chardin, who having been thrice in the East Indies, Persia, and other
remote countries, came hither in our return ships from those parts, and
it being reported that he was a very curious and knowing man, I was
desired by the Royal Society to salute him in their name, and to invite
him to honor them with his company.Sir Joseph Hoskins and Sir
Christopher Wren accompanied me.We found him at his lodgings in his
eastern habit, a very handsome person, extremely affable, a modest,
well-bred man, not inclined to talk wonders.He spoke Latin, and
understood Greek, Arabic, and Persian, from eleven years' travels in
those parts, whither he went in search of jewels, and was become very
rich.After the usual civilities, we
asked some account of the extraordinary things he must have seen in
traveling over land to those places where few, if any, northern
Europeans used to go, as the Black and Caspian Sea, Mingrelia, Bagdad,
Nineveh, Persepolis, etc.He told us that the things most worthy of our
sight would be, the draughts he had caused to be made of some noble
ruins, etc.; for that, besides his own little talent that way, he had
carried two good painters with him, to draw landscapes, measure and
design the remains of the palace which Alexander burned in his frolic at
Persepolis, with divers temples, columns, relievos, and statues, yet
extant, which he affirmed to be sculpture far exceeding anything he had
observed either at Rome, in Greece, or in any other part of the world
where magnificence was in estimation.He said there was an inscription
in letters not intelligible, though entire.He was sorry he could not
gratify the curiosity of the Society at present, his things not being
yet out of the ship; but would wait on them with them on his return from
Paris, whither he was going the next day, but with intention to return
suddenly, and stay longer here, the persecution in France not suffering
Protestants, and he was one, to be quiet.He told us that Nineveh was a vast city, now all buried in her ruins,
the inhabitants building on the subterranean vaults, which were, as
appeared, the first stories of the old city, that there were frequently
found huge vases of fine earth, columns, and other antiquities; that the
straw which the Egyptians required of the Israelites, was not to burn,
or cover the rows of bricks as we use, but being chopped small to mingle
with the clay, which being dried in the sun (for they bake not in the
furnace) would else cleave asunder; that in Persia are yet a race of
Ignicolae, who worship the sun and the fire as Gods; that the women of
Georgia and Mingrelia were universally, and without any compare, the
most beautiful creatures for shape, features, and figure, in the world,
and therefore the Grand Seignor and Bashaws had had from thence most of
their wives and concubines; that there had within these hundred years
been Amazons among them, that is to say, a sort or race of valiant
women, given to war; that Persia was extremely fertile; he spoke also of
Japan and China, and of the many great errors of our late geographers,
as we suggested matter for discourse.We then took our leave, failing of
seeing his papers; but it was told us by others that indeed he dared not
open, or show them, till he had first showed them to the French King;
but of this he himself said nothing.[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d September, 1680.I had an opportunity, his Majesty being still at
Windsor, of seeing his private library at Whitehall, at my full ease.I
went with expectation of finding some curiosities, but, though there
were about 1,000 volumes, there were few of importance which I had not
perused before.They consisted chiefly of such books as had from time to
time been dedicated, or presented to him; a few histories, some Travels
and French books, abundance of maps and sea charts, entertainments and
pomps, buildings and pieces relating to the navy, some mathematical
instruments; but what was most rare, were three or four Romish
breviaries, with a great deal of miniature and monkish painting and
gilding, one of which is most exquisitely done, both as to the figures,
grotesques, and compartments, to the utmost of that curious art.There
is another in which I find written by the hand of King Henry VII., his
giving it to his dear daughter, Margaret, afterward Queen of Scots, in
which he desires her to pray for his soul, subscribing his name at
length.There is also the process of the philosophers' great elixir,
represented in divers pieces of excellent miniature, but the discourse
is in high Dutch, a MS.in quarto, of above 300
years old, in French, being an institution of physic, and in the
botanical part the plants are curiously painted in miniature; also a
folio MS.of good thickness, being the several exercises, as Themes,
Orations, Translations, etc., of King Edward VI., all written and
subscribed by his own hand, and with his name very legible, and divers
of the Greek interleaved and corrected after the manner of schoolboys'
exercises, and that exceedingly well and proper; with some epistles to
his preceptor, which show that young prince to have been extraordinarily
advanced in learning, and as Cardan, who had been in England affirmed,
stupendously knowing for his age.There is likewise his journal, no less
testifying his early ripeness and care about the affairs of state.There are besides many pompous volumes, some embossed with gold, and
intaglios on agates, medals, etc.I spent three or four entire days,
locked up, and alone, among these books and curiosities.In the rest of
the private lodgings contiguous to this, are divers of the best pictures
of the great masters, Raphael, Titian, etc., and in my esteem, above
all, the "_Noli me tangere_" of our blessed Savior to Mary Magdalen
after his Resurrection, of Hans Holbein; than which I never saw so much
reverence and kind of heavenly astonishment expressed in a picture.There are also divers curious clocks, watches, and pendules of exquisite
work, and other curiosities.An ancient woman who made these lodgings
clean, and had all the keys, let me in at pleasure for a small reward,
by means of a friend.I dined with Sir Stephen Fox, now one of the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury.This gentleman came first a poor boy from
the choir of Salisbury, then he was taken notice of by Bishop Duppa, and
afterward waited on my Lord Percy (brother to Algernon, Earl of
Northumberland), who procured for him an inferior place among the clerks
of the kitchen and Greencloth side, where he was found so humble,
diligent, industrious, and prudent in his behavior, that his Majesty
being in exile, and Mr.Fox waiting, both the King and Lords about him
frequently employed him about their affairs, and trusted him both with
receiving and paying the little money they had.Returning with his
Majesty to England, after great want and great sufferings, his Majesty
found him so honest and industrious, and withal so capable and ready,
that, being advanced from clerk of the kitchen to that of the
Greencloth, he procured to be paymaster of the whole army, and by his
dexterity and punctual dealing he obtained such credit among the
bankers, that he was in a short time able to borrow vast sums of them
upon any exigence.The continual turning thus of money, and the
soldiers' moderate allowance to him for keeping touch with them, did so
enrich him, that he is believed to be worth at least L200,000, honestly
got and unenvied; which is next to a miracle.With all this he continues
as humble and ready to do a courtesy as ever he was.He is generous, and lives very honorably, of a sweet nature,
well-spoken, well-bred, and is so highly in his Majesty's esteem, and so
useful, that being long since made a knight, he is also advanced to be
one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, and has the reversion of
the Cofferer's place after Harry Brouncker.He has married his eldest
daughter to my Lord Cornwallis, and gave her L12,000, and restored that
entangled family besides.Trollop, who brings
with her (besides a great sum) near, if not altogether, L2,000 per
annum.Sir Stephen's lady (an excellent woman) is sister to Mr.Whittle,
one of the King's chirurgeons.In a word, never was man more fortunate
than Sir Stephen; he is a handsome person, virtuous, and very religious.Came to my house some German strangers and Signor
Pietro, a famous musician, who had been long in Sweden in Queen
Christina's Court; he sung admirably to a guitar, and had a perfect good
tenor and bass, and had set to Italian composure many of Abraham
Cowley's pieces which showed extremely well.He told me that in Sweden
the heat in some part of summer was as excessive as the cold in winter;
so cold, he affirmed, that the streets of all the towns are desolate, no
creatures stirring in them for many months, all the inhabitants retiring
to their stoves.He spoke high things of that romantic Queen's learning
and skill in languages, the majesty of her behavior, her exceeding wit,
and that the histories she had read of other countries, especially of
Italy and Rome, had made her despise her own.That the real occasion of
her resigning her crown was the nobleman's importuning her to marry, and
the promise which the Pope had made her of procuring her to be Queen of
Naples, which also caused her to change her religion; but she was
cheated by his crafty Holiness,[43] working on her ambition; that the
reason of her killing her secretary at Fontainebleau, was, his revealing
that intrigue with the Pope.But, after all this, I rather believe it
was her mad prodigality and extreme vanity, which had consumed those
vast treasures the great Adolphus, her father, had brought out of
Germany during his [campaigns] there and wonderful successes; and that,
if she had not voluntarily resigned, as foreseeing the event, the
Estates of her kingdom would have compelled her to do so.[Footnote 43: Pope Alexander VII., of the family of Chighi, at
    Sienna.][Sidenote: LONDON]

30th October, 1680.I went to London to be private, my birthday being
the next day, and I now arrived at my sixtieth year; on which I began a
more solemn survey of my whole life, in order to the making and
confirming my peace with God, by an accurate scrutiny of all my actions
past, as far as I was able to call them to mind.How difficult and
uncertain, yet how necessary a work!The Lord be merciful to me, and
accept me!Teach me, therefore, so to
number my days, that I may apply my heart unto wisdom, and make my
calling and election sure.A stranger
preached at Whitehall[44] on Luke xvi.15; the
Holy Communion followed, at which I participated, humbly imploring God's
assistance in the great work I was entering into.Margaret's, on Acts xvii.[Footnote 44: Probably to the King's household, very early in the
    morning, as the custom was.]I began and spent the whole week in examining my life, begging pardon
for my faults, assistance and blessing for the future, that I might, in
some sort, be prepared for the time that now drew near, and not have the
great work to begin, when one can work no longer.I therefore stirred little abroad till the 5th of
November, when I heard Dr.Tenison, the now vicar of St.Lloyd, the former incumbent, being made Bishop of St.I participated of the blessed Communion, finishing
and confirming my resolutions of giving myself up more entirely to God,
to whom I had now most solemnly devoted the rest of the poor remainder
of life in this world; the Lord enabling me, who am an unprofitable
servant, a miserable sinner, yet depending on his infinite goodness and
mercy accepting my endeavors.Came to dine with us Sir Richard Anderson, his
lady, son and wife, sister to my daughter-in-law.[Sidenote: LONDON]

30th November, 1680.The anniversary election at the Royal Society
brought me to London, where was chosen President that excellent person
and great philosopher, Mr.Robert Boyle, who indeed ought to have been
the very first; but neither his infirmity nor his modesty could now any
longer excuse him.I desired I might for this year be left out of the
Council, by reason my dwelling was in the country.The Society according
to custom dined together.The signal day begun the trial (at which I was present) of my Lord
Viscount Stafford, (for conspiring the death of the King), second son to
my Lord Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel and Surrey, Earl Marshal of
England, and grandfather to the present Duke of Norfolk, whom I so well
knew, and from which excellent person I received so many favors.It was
likewise his birthday, The trial was in Westminster Hall, before the
King, Lords, and Commons, just in the same manner as, forty years past,
the great and wise Earl of Strafford (there being but one letter
differing their names) received his trial for pretended ill government
in Ireland, in the very same place, this Lord Stafford's father being
then High Steward.The place of sitting was now exalted some
considerable height from the paved floor of the hall, with a stage of
boards.The throne, woolsacks for the Judges, long forms for the Peers,
chair for the Lord Steward, exactly ranged, as in the House of Lords.The sides on both hands scaffolded to the very roof for the members of
the House of Commons.At the upper end, and on the right side of the
King's state, was a box for his Majesty, and on the left others for the
great ladies, and over head a gallery for ambassadors and public
ministers.At the lower end, or entrance, was a bar, and place for the
prisoner, the Lieutenant of the Tower of London, the ax-bearer and
guards, my Lord Stafford's two daughters, the Marchioness of Winchester
being one; there was likewise a box for my Lord to retire into.At the
right hand, in another box, somewhat higher, stood the witnesses; at the
left, the managers, in the name of the Commons of England, namely,
Serjeant Maynard (the great lawyer, the same who prosecuted the cause
against the Earl of Strafford forty years before, being now near eighty
years of age), Sir William Jones, late Attorney-General, Sir Francis
Winnington, a famous pleader, and Mr.Treby, now Recorder of London, not
appearing in their gowns as lawyers, but in their cloaks and swords, as
representing the Commons of England: to these were joined Mr.Poule, Colonel Titus, Sir Thomas Lee, all gentlemen
of quality, and noted parliamentary men.The first two days, in which
were read the commission and impeachment, were but a tedious entrance
into matter of fact, at which I was but little present.But, on
Thursday, I was commodiously seated among the Commons, when the
witnesses were sworn and examined.Oates
swore that he delivered a commission to Viscount Stafford from the Pope,
to be Paymaster-General to an army intended to be raised; Dugdale, that
being at Lord Aston's, the prisoner dealt with him plainly to murder his
Majesty; and Turberville, that at Paris he also proposed the same to
him.The depositions of my Lord's witnesses were taken, to
invalidate the King's witnesses; they were very slight persons, but,
being fifteen or sixteen, they took up all that day, and in truth they
rather did my Lord more injury than service.Came other witnesses of the Commons to corroborate
the King's, some being Peers, some Commons, with others of good quality,
who took off all the former day's objections, and set the King's
witnesses _recti in curia_.Sir William Jones summed up the evidence; to him
succeeded all the rest of the managers, and then Mr.Henry Poule made a
vehement oration.After this my Lord, as on all occasions, and often
during the trial, spoke in his own defense, denying the charge
altogether, and that he had never seen Oates, or Turberville, at the
time and manner affirmed: in truth, their testimony did little weigh
with me; Dugdale's only seemed to press hardest, to which my Lord spoke
a great while, but confusedly, without any method.One thing my Lord said as to Oates, which I confess did exceedingly
affect me: That a person who during his depositions should so vauntingly
brag that though he went over to the Church of Rome, yet he was never a
<DW7>, nor of their religion, all the time that he seemed to apostatize
from the Protestant, but only as a spy; though he confessed he took
their sacrament; worshiped images, went through all their oaths and
discipline of their proselytes, swearing secrecy and to be faithful, but
with intent to come over again and betray them; that such a hypocrite,
that had so deeply prevaricated as even to turn idolater (for so we of
the Church of England termed it), attesting God so solemnly that he was
entirely theirs and devoted to their interest, and consequently (as he
pretended) trusted; I say, that the witness of such a profligate wretch
should be admitted against the life of a peer,--this my Lord looked upon
as a monstrous thing, and such as must needs redound to the dishonor of
our religion and nation.And verily I am of his Lordship's opinion: such
a man's testimony should not be taken against the life of a dog.But the
merit of something material which he discovered against Coleman, put him
in such esteem with the Parliament, that now, I fancy, he stuck at
nothing, and thought everybody was to take what he said for Gospel.The
consideration of this, and some other circumstances, began to stagger
me; particularly how it was possible that one who went among the <DW7>s
on such a design, and pretended to be intrusted with so many letters and
commissions from the Pope and the party,--nay, and delivered them to so
many great persons,--should not reserve one of them to show, nor so much
as one copy of any commission, which he who had such dexterity in
opening letters might certainly have done, to the undeniable conviction
of those whom he accused; but, as I said, he gained credit on Coleman.But, as to others whom he so madly flew upon, I am little inclined to
believe his testimony, he being so slight a person, so passionate, ill
bred, and of such impudent behavior; nor is it likely that such piercing
politicians as the Jesuits should trust him with so high and so
dangerous secrets.On Tuesday, I was again at the trial, when judgment
was demanded; and, after my Lord had spoken what he could in denying the
fact, the managers answering the objections, the Peers adjourned to
their House, and within two hours returned again.There was, in the
meantime, this question put to the judges, "whether there being but one
witness to any single crime, or act, it could amount to convict a man of
treason."They gave an unanimous opinion that in case of treason they
all were overt acts for though no man should be condemned by one witness
for any one act, yet for several acts to the same intent, it was valid;
which was my Lord's case.This being past, and the Peers in their seats
again, the Lord Chancellor Finch (this day the Lord High-Steward)
removing to the woolsack next his Majesty's state, after summoning the
Lieutenant of the Tower to bring forth his prisoner, and proclamation
made for silence, demanded of every Peer (who were in all eighty-six)
whether William, Lord Viscount Stafford, were guilty of the treason laid
to his charge, or not guilty.Then the Peer spoken to, standing up, and laying his right hand upon his
breast, said guilty, or not guilty, upon my honor, and then sat down,
the Lord Steward noting their suffrages as they answered upon a paper:
when all had done, the number of not guilty being but 31, the guilty 55;
and then, after proclamation for silence again, the Lord Steward
directing his speech to the prisoner, against whom the ax was turned
edgeways and not before, in aggravation of his crime, he being ennobled
by the King's father, and since received many favors from his present
Majesty: after enlarging on his offense, deploring first his own
unhappiness that he who had never condemned any man before should now be
necessitated to begin with him, he then pronounced sentence of death by
hanging, drawing, and quartering, according to form, with great
solemnity and dreadful gravity; and, after a short pause, told the
prisoner that he believed the Lords would intercede for the omission of
some circumstances of his sentence, beheading only excepted; and then
breaking his white staff, the Court was dissolved.My Lord Stafford
during all this latter part spoke but little, and only gave their
Lordships thanks after the sentence was pronounced; and indeed behaved
himself modestly, and as became him.It was observed that all his own relations of his name and family
condemned him, except his nephew, the Earl of Arundel, son to the Duke
of Norfolk.And it must be acknowledged that the whole trial was carried
on with exceeding gravity: so stately and august an appearance I had
never seen before; for, besides the innumerable spectators of gentlemen
and foreign ministers, who saw and heard all the proceedings, the
prisoner had the consciences of all the Commons of England for his
accusers, and all the Peers to be his judges and jury.He had likewise
the assistance of what counsel he would, to direct him in his plea, who
stood by him.And yet I can hardly think that a person of his age and
experience should engage men whom he never saw before (and one of them
that came to visit him as a stranger at Paris) POINT BLANK to murder the
King: God only, who searches hearts, can discover the truth.Lord
Stafford was not a man beloved especially of his own family.This evening, looking out of my chamber window
toward the west, I saw a meteor of an obscure bright color, very much in
shape like the blade of a sword, the rest of the sky very serene and
clear.What this may portend, God only knows; but such another
phenomenon I remember to have seen in 1640, about the trial of the great
Earl of Strafford, preceding our bloody Rebellion.We have had of late several comets, which though I believe
appear from natural causes, and of themselves operate not, yet I cannot
despise them.They may be warnings from God, as they commonly are
forerunners of his animadversions.After many days and nights of snow,
cloudy and dark weather, the comet was very much wasted.My daughter-in-law was brought to bed of a son,
christened Richard.A solemn public Fast that God would prevent all
Popish plots, avert his judgments, and give a blessing to the
proceedings of Parliament now assembled, and which struck at the
succession of the Duke of York.The Viscount Stafford was beheaded on Towerhill.I was at the wedding of my nephew, John Evelyn
of Wotton, married by the Bishop of Rochester at Westminster, in Henry
VII.'s chapel, to the daughter and heir of Mr.Eversfield, of Sussex,
her portion L8,000.The solemnity was kept with a few friends only at
Lady Beckford's, the lady's mother.Visited and dined at the Earl of Essex's, with whom I
spent most of the afternoon alone.Thence to my (yet living) godmother
and kinswoman, Mrs.Keightley, sister to Sir Thomas Evelyn and niece to
my father, being now eighty-six years of age, sprightly, and in perfect
health, her eyes serving her as well as ever, and of a comely
countenance, that one would not suppose her above fifty.Great
expectation of his Royal Highness's case as to the succession, against
which the House was set.An extraordinary sharp, cold spring, not yet a leaf on the trees, frost
and snow lying: while the whole nation was in the greatest ferment.Asaph) at
his house in Leicester Fields, now going to reside in his diocese.Brisbane's, Secretary to the Admiralty,
a learned and industrious person, whither came Dr.Burnet, to thank me
for some papers I had contributed toward his excellent "History of the

26th April, 1681.I dined at Don Pietro Ronquillo's, the Spanish
Ambassador, at Wild House, who used me with extraordinary civility.The
dinner was plentiful, half after the Spanish, half after the English
way.After dinner, he led me into his bedchamber, where we fell into a
long discourse concerning religion.Though he was a learned man in
politics, and an advocate, he was very ignorant in religion, and unable
to defend any point of controversy; he was, however, far from being
fierce.At parting, he earnestly wished me to apply humbly to the
blessed virgin to direct me, assuring me that he had known divers who
had been averse from the Roman Catholic religion, wonderfully
enlightened and convinced by her intercession.He importuned me to come
and visit him often.Came to dine with me Sir William Fermor, of
Northamptonshire, and Sir Christopher Wren, his Majesty's architect and
surveyor, now building the Cathedral of St.Paul, and the column in
memory of the city's conflagration, and was in hand with the building of
fifty parish churches.Came my Lady Sunderland, to desire that I would propose
a match to Sir Stephen Fox for her son, Lord Spencer, to marry Mrs.I excused myself all I was able; for the
truth is, I was afraid he would prove an extravagant man: for, though a
youth of extraordinary parts, and had an excellent education to render
him a worthy man, yet his early inclinations to extravagance made me
apprehensive, that I should not serve Sir Stephen by proposing it, like
a friend; this being now his only daughter, well-bred, and likely to
receive a large share of her father's opulence.Lord Sunderland was much
sunk in his estate by gaming and other prodigalities, and was now no
longer Secretary of State, having fallen into displeasure of the King
for siding with the Commons about the succession; but which, I am
assured, he did not do out of his own inclination, or for the
preservation of the Protestant religion, but by mistaking the ability of
the party to carry it.However, so earnest and importunate was the
Countess, that I did mention it to Sir Stephen, who said it was too
great an honor, that his daughter was very young, as well as my Lord,
and he was resolved never to marry her without the parties' mutual
liking; with other objections which I neither would or could contradict.He desired me to express to the Countess the great sense he had of the
honor done him, that his daughter and her son were too young, that he
would do nothing without her liking, which he did not think her capable
of expressing judiciously, till she was sixteen or seventeen years of
age, of which she now wanted four years, and that I would put it off as
civilly as I could.Our new curate preached, a pretty hopeful young man, yet
somewhat raw, newly come from college, full of Latin sentences, which in
time will wear off.There came to visit me Sir William Walter and Sir John
Elowes: and the next day, the Earl of Kildare, a young gentleman related
to my wife, and other company.There had scarce fallen any rain since
Christmas.I went to Hampton Court, when the Surrey gentlemen
presented their addresses to his Majesty, whose hand I kissed,
introduced by the Duke of Albemarle.Being at the Privy Council, I took
another occasion of discoursing with Sir Stephen Fox about his daughter
and to revive that business, and at least brought it to this: That in
case the young people liked one the other, after four years, he first
desiring to see a particular of my Lord's present estate if I could
transmit it to him privately, he would make her portion L14,000, though
to all appearance he might likely make it L50,000 as easily, his eldest
son having no child and growing very corpulent.It still continued so great a drought as had never been
known in England, and it was said to be universal.No sermon this afternoon, which I think did not
happen twice in this parish these thirty years; so gracious has God been
to it, and indeed to the whole nation: God grant that we abuse not this
great privilege either by our wantonness, schism, or unfaithfulness,
under such means as he has not favored any other nation under Heaven
besides![Sidenote: WOTTON]

23d August, 1681.I went to Wotton, and, on the following day, was
invited to Mr.Denzil Onslow's at his seat at Purford, where was much
company, and such an extraordinary feast, as I had hardly seen at any
country gentleman's table.What made it more remarkable was, that there
was not anything save what his estate about it did afford; as venison,
rabbits, hares, pheasants, partridges, pigeons, quails, poultry, all
sorts of fowl in season from his own decoy near his house, and all sorts
of fresh fish.After dinner we went to see sport at the decoy, where I
never saw so many herons.The seat stands on a flat, the ground pasture, rarely watered, and
exceedingly improved since Mr.Onslow bought it of Sir Robert Parkhurst,
who spent a fair estate.The house is timber, but commodious, and with
one ample dining-room, the hall adorned with paintings of fowl and
huntings, etc., the work of Mr.Barlow, who is excellent in this kind
from the life.Hussey (at Sutton in
Shere), who has a very pretty seat well watered, near my brother's.He
is the neatest husband for curious ordering his domestic and field
accommodations, and what pertains to husbandry, that I have ever seen,
as to his granaries, tacklings, tools, and utensils, plows, carts,
stables, wood piles, wood houses, even to hen roosts and hog troughs.Methought, I saw old Cato, or Varro, in him; all substantial, all in
exact order.The sole inconvenience he lies under, is the great quantity
of sand which the stream brings along with it, and fills his canals and
receptacles for fish too soon.The rest of my time of stay at Wotton was
spent in walking about the grounds and goodly woods, where I have in my
youth so often entertained my solitude; and so, on the 2d of September,
I once more returned to my home.Died my pretty grandchild, and was interred on the
8th [at Deptford].Dined with Sir Stephen Fox, who proposed to me the
purchasing of Chelsea College, which his Majesty had sometime since
given to our Society, and would now purchase it again to build a
hospital; or infirmary for soldiers there, in which he desired my
assistance as one of the Council of the Royal Society.I had another opportunity of visiting his
Majesty's private library at Whitehall.To Sir Samuel Morland's, to see his house and mechanics.I went with Monsieur Faubert about taking the
Countess of Bristol's house for an academy, he being lately come from
Paris for his religion, and resolving to settle here.I went to see Sir Thomas Bond's fine house and
garden at Peckham.I went to Camberwell, where that good man Dr.Parr
(late chaplain to Archbishop Usher) preached on Acts xvi.To Fulham, to visit the Bishop of London, in whose
garden I first saw the _Sedum arborescens_ in flower, which was
exceedingly beautiful.16, 17, before the
King, of the usurpation of the Church of Rome.This is one of the first
rank of pulpit men in the nation.I dined with the Earl of Essex who, after dinner
in his study, where we were alone, related to me how much he had been
scandalized and injured in the report of his being privy to the marriage
of his Lady's niece, the rich young widow of the late Lord Ogle, sole
daughter of the Earl of Northumberland; showing me a letter of Mr.Thynn's, excusing himself for not communicating his marriage to his
Lordship.He acquainted me also with the whole story of that unfortunate
lady being betrayed by her grandmother, the Countess of Northumberland,
and Colonel Bret, for money; and that though, upon the importunity of
the Duke of Monmouth, he had delivered to the grandmother a particular
of the jointure which Mr.Thynn pretended he would settle on the lady,
yet he totally discouraged the proceeding as by no means a competent
match for one that both by birth and fortune might have pretended to the
greatest prince in Christendom; that he also proposed the Earl of
Kingston, or the Lord Cranburn, but was by no means for Mr.[Sidenote: LONDON]

19th November, 1681.I dined with my worthy friend, Mr.Erskine, Master
of the Charter House, uncle to the Duchess of Monmouth; a wise and
learned gentleman, fitter to have been a privy councillor and minister
of state than to have been laid aside.I was at the audience of the Russian Ambassador
before both their Majesties in the Banqueting House.The presents were
carried before him, held up by his followers in two ranks before the
King's State, and consisted of tapestry (one suite of which was
doubtlessly brought from France as being of that fabric, the Ambassador
having passed through that kingdom as he came out of Spain), a large
Persian carpet, furs of sable and ermine, etc.; but nothing was so
splendid and exotic as the Ambassador who came soon after the King's
restoration.This present Ambassador was exceedingly offended that his
coach was not permitted to come into the Court, till, being told that no
King's Ambassador did, he was pacified, yet requiring an attestation of
it under the hand of Sir Charles Cotterell, the Master of the
Ceremonies; being, it seems, afraid he should offend his Master, if he
omitted the least punctilio.It was reported he condemned his son to
lose his head for shaving off his beard, and putting himself in the
French mode at Paris, and that he would have executed it, had not the
French King interceded--but qy.Sir Christopher Wren chosen President [of the Royal
Society], Mr.Plot, the ingenious author of
the "History of Oxfordshire."I saw the audience of the Morocco Ambassador,
his retinue not numerous.He was received in the Banqueting House, both
their Majesties being present.He came up to the throne without making
any sort of reverence, not bowing his head, or body.He spoke by a
renegado Englishman, for whose safe return there was a promise.They
were all clad in the Moorish habit, cassocks of  cloth, or silk,
with buttons and loops, over this an _alhaga_, or white woolen mantle,
so large as to wrap both head and body, a sash, or small turban,
naked-legged and armed, but with leather socks like the Turks, rich
scymetar, and large calico sleeved shirts.The Ambassador had a string
of pearls oddly woven in his turban.I fancy the old Roman habit was
little different as to the mantle and naked limbs.He was a handsome
person, well featured, of a wise look, subtle, and extremely civil.Their presents were lions and ostriches; their errand about a peace at
Tangier.But the concourse and tumult of the people was intolerable, so
as the officers could keep no order, which these strangers were
astonished at first, there being nothing so regular, exact, and
performed with such silence, as is on all these public occasions of
their country, and indeed over all the Turkish dominions.Dined at the Bishop of Rochester's, at the Abbey, it
being his marriage day, after twenty-four years.He related to me how he
had been treated by Sir William Temple, foreseeing that he might be a
delegate in the concern of my Lady Ogle now likely come in controversy
upon her marriage with Mr.Thynn; also how earnestly the late Earl of
Danby, Lord Treasurer, sought his friendship, and what plain and sincere
advice he gave him from time to time about his miscarriages and
partialities; particularly his outing Sir John Duncomb from being
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Sir Stephen Fox, above all, from being
Paymaster of the Army.The Treasurer's excuse and reason was, that Fox's
credit was so over great with the bankers and monied men, that he could
procure none but by his means, "for that reason," replied the Bishop, "I
would have made him my friend, Sir Stephen being a person both honest
and of credit."He told him likewise of his stateliness and difficulty
of access, and several other miscarriages, and which indeed made him
hated.To the Royal Society, where at the Council we
passed a new law for the more accurate consideration of candidates, as
whether they would really be useful; also concerning the honorary
members, that none should be admitted but by diploma.[Sidenote: LONDON]

This evening I was at the entertainment of the Morocco Ambassador at the
Duchess of Portsmouth's glorious apartments at Whitehall, where was a
great banquet of sweetmeats and music; but at which both the Ambassador
and his retinue behaved themselves with extraordinary moderation and
modesty, though placed about a long table, a lady between two Moors, and
among these were the King's natural children, namely, Lady Lichfield and
Sussex, the Duchess of Portsmouth, Nelly, etc., concubines, and cattle
of that sort, as splendid as jewels and excess of bravery could make
them; the Moors neither admiring nor seeming to regard anything,
furniture or the like, with any earnestness, and but decently tasting of
the banquet.They drank a little milk and water, but not a drop of wine;
they also drank of a sorbet and jacolatt;[45] did not look about, or
stare on the ladies, or express the least surprise, but with a courtly
negligence in pace, countenance, and whole behavior, answering only to
such questions as were asked with a great deal of wit and gallantry, and
so gravely took leave with this compliment, that God would bless the
Duchess of Portsmouth and the Prince, her son meaning the little Duke of
Richmond.The King came in at the latter end, just as the Ambassador was
going away.In this manner was this slave (for he was no more at home)
entertained by most of the nobility in town, and went often to Hyde Park
on horseback, where he and his retinue showed their extraordinary
activity in horsemanship, and flinging and catching their lances at full
speed; they rode very short, and could stand upright at full speed,
managing their spears with incredible agility.He went sometimes to the
theaters, where, upon any foolish or fantastical action, he could not
forbear laughing, but he endeavored to hide it with extraordinary
modesty and gravity.In a word, the Russian Ambassador, still at Court
behaved himself like a clown compared to this civil heathen.This evening, Sir Stephen Fox acquainted me again
with his Majesty's resolution of proceeding in the erection of a Royal
Hospital for emerited soldiers on that spot of ground which the Royal
Society had sold to his Majesty for L1,300, and that he would settle
L5,000 per annum on it, and build to the value of L20,000 for the relief
and reception of four companies, namely, 400 men, to be as in a college,
or monastery.I was therefore desired by Sir Stephen (who had not only
the whole managing of this, but was, as I perceived, himself to be a
grand benefactor, as well it became him who had gotten so vast an estate
by the soldiers) to assist him, and consult what method to cast it in,
as to the government.So, in his study we arranged the governor,
chaplain, steward, housekeeper, chirurgeon, cook, butler, gardener,
porter, and other officers, with their several salaries and
entertainments.I would needs have a library, and mentioned several
books, since some soldiers might possibly be studious, when they were at
leisure to recollect.Thus we made the first calculations, and set down
our thoughts to be considered and digested better, to show his Majesty
and the Archbishop.He also engaged me to consider of what laws and
orders were fit for the government, which was to be in every respect as
strict as in any religious convent.After supper, came in the famous treble, Mr.Abel, newly returned from
Italy; I never heard a more excellent voice; one would have sworn it had
been a woman's, it was so high, and so well and skillfully managed,
being accompanied by Signor Francesco on the harpsichord.Pepys, late Secretary to the Admiralty, showed
me a large folio containing the whole mechanic part and art of building
royal ships and men-of-war, made by Sir Anthony Dean, being so accurate
a piece from the very keel to the lead block, rigging, guns, victualing,
manning, and even to every individual pin and nail, in a method so
astonishing and curious, with a draught, both geometrical and in
perspective, and several sections, that I do not think the world can
show the like.My daughter, Mary, began to learn music of Signor
Bartholomeo, and dancing of Monsieur Isaac, reputed the best masters.Having had several violent fits of an ague, recourse was had to bathing
my legs in milk up to the knees, made as hot as I could endure it: and
sitting so in it in a deep churn, or vessel, covered with blankets, and
drinking _carduus_ posset, then going to bed and sweating, I not only
missed that expected fit, but had no more, only continued weak, that I
could not go to church till Ash Wednesday, which I had not missed, I
think, so long in twenty years, so gracious had God been to me.After this warning and admonition, I now began to look over and
methodize all my writings, accounts, letters, papers; inventoried the
goods, and other articles of the house, and put things into the best
order I could, and made my will; that now, growing in years, I might
have none of these secular things and concerns to distract me, when it
should please Almighty God to call me from this transitory life.With
this, I prepared some special meditations and devotions for the time of
sickness.The Lord Jesus grant them to be salutary for my poor soul in
that day, that I may obtain mercy and acceptance!My second grandchild was born, and christened the next
day by our vicar at Sayes Court, by the name of John.[46] I beseech God
to bless him![Footnote 46: Who became his successor, and was created a baronet in
    1713.]I went to church: our vicar preached on
Proverbs, showing what care and vigilance was required for the keeping
of the heart upright.The Holy Communion followed, on which I gave God
thanks for his gracious dealing with me in my late sickness, and
affording me this blessed opportunity of praising him in the
congregation, and receiving the cup of salvation with new and serious
resolutions.Came to see and congratulate my recovery, Sir John Lowther, Mr.Pepys, Sir Anthony Deane, and Mr.This day was executed Colonel Vrats, and some of his
accomplices, for the execrable murder of Mr.Thynn, set on by the
principal Koningsmark.He went to execution like an undaunted hero, as
one that had done a friendly office for that base coward, Count
Koningsmark, who had hopes to marry his widow, the rich Lady Ogle, and
was acquitted by a corrupt jury, and so got away.Vrats told a friend of
mine who accompanied him to the gallows, and gave him some advice that
he did not value dying of a rush, and hoped and believed God would deal
with him like a gentleman.Never man went, so unconcerned for his sad
fate.I went to see the corpse of that obstinate creature,
Colonel Vrats, the King permitting that his body should be transported
to his own country, he being of a good family, and one of the first
embalmed by a particular art, invented by one William Russell, a
coffin-maker, which preserved the body without disboweling, or to
appearance using any bituminous matter.The flesh was florid, soft, and
full, as if the person were only sleeping.He had now been dead near
fifteen days, and lay exposed in a very rich coffin lined with lead, too
magnificent for so daring and horrid a murderer.[Sidenote: LONDON]

At the meeting of the Royal Society were exhibited some pieces of amber
sent by the Duke of Brandenburg, in one of which was a spider, in
another a gnat, both very entire.There was a discourse of the tingeing
of glass, especially with red, and the difficulty of finding any red
color effectual to penetrate glass, among the glass-painters; that the
most diaporous, as blue, yellow, etc., did not enter into the substance
of what was ordinarily painted, more than very shallow, unless
incorporated in the metal itself, other reds and whites not at all
beyond the superfices.To the Royal Society, where at a Council was regulated
what collections should be published monthly, as formerly the
transactions, which had of late been discontinued, but were now much
called for by the curious abroad and at home.I went this afternoon with several of the Royal
Society to a supper which was all dressed, both fish and flesh, in
Monsieur Papin's digestors, by which the hardest bones of beef itself,
and mutton, were made as soft as cheese, without water or other liquor,
and with less than eight ounces of coals, producing an incredible
quantity of gravy; and for close of all, a jelly made of the bones of
beef, the best for clearness and good relish, and the most delicious
that I had ever seen, or tasted.We ate pike and other fish, bones and
all, without impediment; but nothing exceeded the pigeons, which tasted
just as if baked in a pie, all these being stewed in their own juice,
without any addition of water save what swam about the digestor, as _in
balneo_; the natural juice of all these provisions acting on the grosser
substances, reduced the hardest bones to tenderness; but it is best
descanted with more particulars for extracting tinctures, preserving and
stewing fruit, and saving fuel, in Dr.Papin's book, published and
dedicated to our Society of which he is a member.He is since gone to
Venice with the late Resident here (and also a member of our Society),
who carried this excellent mechanic, philosopher, and physician, to set
up a philosophical meeting in that city.This philosophical supper
caused much mirth among us, and exceedingly pleased all the company.I
sent a glass of the jelly to my wife, to the reproach of all that the
ladies ever made of their best hartshorn.[47]

Wren to accompany them to Lambeth, with the plot and design of the
college to be built at Chelsea, to have the Archbishop's approbation.It
was a quadrangle of 200 feet square, after the dimensions of the larger

election sure, were they irreversible and what the rigid Presbyterians
pretend.Lawrence's church, a new and cheerful

Maimburg had published about the motives of the late Duchess of York's
perversion, in his "History of Calvinism;" and did myself write to the
Bishop of Winchester about it, who being concerned in it, I urged him to
set forth his vindication.The Morocco Ambassador being admitted an honorary member
of the Royal Society, and subscribing his name and titles in Arabic, I
was deputed by the Council to go and compliment him.The Bantam, or East India Ambassadors (at this time we
had in London the Russian, Moroccan, and Indian Ambassadors), being
invited to dine at Lord George Berkeley's (now Earl), I went to the
entertainment to contemplate the exotic guests.They were both very
hard-favored, and much resembling in countenance some sort of monkeys.We ate at two tables, the Ambassadors and interpreter by themselves.Their garments were rich Indian silks, flowered with gold, viz, a close
waistcoat to their knees, drawers, naked legs, and on their heads caps
made like fruit baskets.They wore poisoned daggers at their bosoms, the
hafts carved with some ugly serpents' or devils' heads, exceedingly
keen, and of Damascus metal.The second Ambassador
(sent it seems to succeed in case the first should die by the way in so
tedious a journey), having been at Mecca, wore a Turkish or Arab sash, a
little part of the linen hanging down behind his neck, with some other
difference of habit, and was half a <DW64>, bare legged and naked feet,
and deemed a very holy man.They sat cross-legged like Turks, and
sometimes in the posture of apes and monkeys; their nails and teeth as
black as jet, and shining, which being the effect, as to their teeth, of
perpetually chewing betel to preserve them from the toothache, much
raging in their country, is esteemed beautiful.The first ambassador was of an olive hue, a flat face, narrow eyes,
squat nose, and Moorish lips, no hair appeared; they wore several rings
of silver, gold and copper on their fingers, which was a token of
knighthood, or nobility.They were of Java Major, whose princes have
been turned Mahometans not above fifty years since; the inhabitants are
still pagans and idolaters.They seemed of a dull and heavy
constitution, not wondering at any thing they saw; but exceedingly
astonished how our law gave us propriety in our estates, and so thinking
we were all kings, for they could not be made to comprehend how subjects
could possess anything but at the pleasure of their Prince, they being
all slaves; they were pleased with the notion, and admired our
happiness.They were very sober, and I believe subtle in their way.Their meat was cooked, carried up, and they attended by several fat
slaves, who had no covering save drawers, which appeared very uncouth
and loathsome.They ate their pilaw, and other spoon-meat, without
spoons, taking up their pottage in the hollow of their fingers, and very
dexterously flung it into their mouths without spilling a drop.Came to dine with me, the Duke of Grafton and the young
Earl of Ossory, son to my most dear deceased friend.Went to visit our good neighbor, Mr.Bohun, whose whole
house is a cabinet of all elegancies, especially Indian; in the hall are
contrivances of Japan screens, instead of wainscot; and there is an
excellent pendule clock inclosed in the curious flowerwork of Mr.Gibbons, in the middle of the vestibule.The landscapes of the screens
represent the manner of living, and country of the Chinese.But, above
all, his lady's cabinet is adorned on the fret, ceiling, and
chimney-piece, with Mr.There are also some of
Streeter's best paintings, and many rich curiosities of gold and silver
as growing in the mines.The gardens are exactly kept, and the whole
place very agreeable and well watered.The owners are good neighbors,
and Mr.Bohun has also built and endowed a hospital for eight poor
people, with a pretty chapel, and every necessary accommodation.To the Bishop of London at Fulham, to review the
additions which Mr.Marshall had made to his curious book of flowers in
miniature, and collection of insects.With Sir Stephen Fox, to survey the foundations of the
Royal Hospital begun at Chelsea.[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th August, 1682.The Council of the Royal Society had it recommended
to them to be trustees and visitors, or supervisors, of the Academy
which Monsieur Faubert did hope to procure to be built by subscription
of worthy gentlemen and noblemen, for the education of youth, and to
lessen the vast expense the nation is at yearly by sending children into
France to be taught military exercises.We thought to give him all the
encouragement our recommendation could procure.Rogers, an acquaintance of mine
long since at Padua.He was then Consul of the English nation, and
student in that University, where he proceeded Doctor in Physic;
presenting me now with the Latin oration he lately made upon the famous
Dr.Harvey's anniversary in the College of Physicians, at London.This night I saw another comet, near Cancer, very
bright, but the stream not so long as the former.Supped at Lord Clarendon's, with Lord Hyde, his
brother, now the great favorite, who invited himself to dine at my house
the Tuesday following.Being my birthday, and I now entering my great
climacterical of 63, after serious recollections of the years past,
giving Almighty God thanks for all his merciful preservations and
forbearance, begging pardon for my sins and unworthiness, and his
blessing on me the year entering, I went with my Lady Fox to survey her
building, and give some directions for the garden at Chiswick; the
architect is Mr.May,--somewhat heavy and thick, and not so well
understood: the garden much too narrow, the place without water, near a
highway, and near another great house of my Lord Burlington, little land
about it, so that I wonder at the expense; but women will have their
will.I was invited to dine with Monsieur Lionberg, the
Swedish Resident, who made a magnificent entertainment, it being the
birthday of his King.There dined the Duke of Albemarle, Duke of
Hamilton, Earl of Bath, Earl of Aylesbury, Lord Arran, Lord Castlehaven,
the son of him who was executed fifty years before, and several great
persons.I was exceedingly afraid of drinking (it being a Dutch feast),
but the Duke of Albemarle being that night to wait on his Majesty,
excess was prohibited; and, to prevent all, I stole away and left the
company as soon as we rose from table.[Sidenote: LONDON]

28th November, 1682.I went to the Council of the Royal Society, for the
auditing the last year's account, where I was surprised with a fainting
fit that for a time took away my sight; but God being merciful to me, I
recovered it after a short repose.I was exceedingly endangered and importuned to
stand the election,[48] having so many voices, but by favor of my
friends, and regard of my remote dwelling, and now frequent infirmities,
I desired their suffrages might be transferred to Sir John Hoskins, one
of the Masters of Chancery; a most learned virtuoso as well as lawyer,
who accordingly was elected.[Footnote 48: For President of the Royal Society.]Went to congratulate Lord Hyde (the great favorite)
newly made Earl of Rochester, and lately marrying his eldest daughter to
the Earl of Ossory.I sold my East India adventure of L250 principal
for L750 to the Royal Society, after I had been in that company
twenty-five years, being extraordinarily advantageous, by the blessing
of God.Sir Francis North, son to the Lord North, and Lord
Chief Justice, being made Lord Keeper on the death of the Earl of
Nottingham, the Lord Chancellor, I went to congratulate him.He is a
most knowing, learned, and ingenious man, and, besides being an
excellent person, of an ingenious and sweet disposition, very skillful
in music, painting, the new philosophy, and politer studies.Supped at Sir Joseph Williamson's, where was a
select company of our Society, Sir William Petty, Dr.Gale (that learned
schoolmaster of St.The
conversation was philosophical and cheerful, on divers considerable
questions proposed; as of the hereditary succession of the Roman
Emperors; the Pica mentioned in the preface to our Common Prayer, which
signifies only the Greek _Kalendarium_.James's, when I saw the sea
charts of Captain Collins, which that industrious man now brought to
show the Duke, having taken all the coasting from the mouth of the
Thames, as far as Wales, and exactly measuring every creek, island,
rock, soundings, harbors, sands, and tides, intending next spring to
proceed till he had finished the whole island, and that measured by
chains and other instruments: a most exact and useful undertaking.He
affirmed, that of all the maps put out since, there are none extant so
true as those of Joseph Norden, who gave us the first in Queen
Elizabeth's time; all since him are erroneous.This morning I received the news of the death of my
father-in-law, Sir Richard Browne, Knt.and Bart., who died at my house
at Sayes Court this day at ten in the morning, after he had labored
under the gout and dropsy for nearly six months, in the 78th year of his
age.The funeral was solemnized on the 19th at Deptford, with as much
decency as the dignity of the person, and our relation to him, required;
there being invited the Bishop of Rochester, several noblemen, knights,
and all the fraternity of the Trinity Company, of which he had been
Master, and others of the country.The vicar preached a short but proper
discourse on Psalm xxxix.10, on the frailty of our mortal condition,
concluding with an ample and well-deserved eulogy on the defunct,
relating to his honorable birth and ancestors, education, learning in
Greek and Latin, modern languages, travels, public employments, signal
loyalty, character abroad, and particularly the honor of supporting the
Church of England in its public worship during its persecution by the
late rebels' usurpation and regicide, by the suffrages of divers
Bishops, Doctors of the Church, and others, who found such an asylum in
his house and family at Paris, that in their disputes with the <DW7>s
(then triumphing over it as utterly lost) they used to argue for its
visibility and existence from Sir R. Browne's chapel and assembly there.Then he spoke of his great and loyal sufferings during thirteen years'
exile with his present Majesty, his return with him in the signal year
1660; his honorable employment at home, his timely recess to recollect
himself, his great age, infirmities, and death.He gave to the Trinity Corporation that land in Deptford on which are
built those almshouses for twenty-four widows of emerited seamen.He was
born the famous year of the Gunpowder Treason, in 1605, and being the
last [male] of his family, left my wife, his only daughter, heir.His
grandfather, Sir Richard Browne, was the great instrument under the
great Earl of Leicester (favorite to Queen Elizabeth) in his government
of the Netherland.He was Master of the Household to King James, and
Cofferer; I think was the first who regulated the compositions through
England for the King's household, provisions, progresses,[49] etc.,
which was so high a service, and so grateful to the whole nation, that
he had acknowledgments and public thanks sent him from all the counties;
he died by the rupture of a vein in a vehement speech he made about the
compositions in a Parliament of King James.By his mother's side he was
a Gunson, Treasurer of the Navy in the reigns of Henry VIII., Queen
Mary, and Queen Elizabeth, and, as by his large pedigree appears,
related to divers of the English nobility.Thus ended this honorable
person, after so many changes and tossings to and fro, in the same house
where he was born."Lord teach us so to number our days, that we may
apply our hearts unto wisdom!"[Footnote 49: Notice was taken of this in a previous passage of the
    "Diary."The different counties were bound to supply provisions of
    various kinds, and these were collected by officers called
    purveyors, whose extortions often excited the attention of
    Parliament.]By a special clause in his will, he ordered that his body should be
buried in the churchyard under the southeast window of the chancel,
adjoining to the burying places of his ancestors, since they came out of
Essex into Sayes Court, he being much offended at the novel custom of
burying everyone within the body of the church and chancel; that being a
favor heretofore granted to martyrs and great persons; this excess of
making churches charnel houses being of ill and irreverend example, and
prejudicial to the health of the living, besides the continual
disturbance of the pavement and seats, and several other indecencies.Hall, the pious Bishop of Norwich, would also be so interred, as may
be read in his testament.I went to see Sir Josiah Child's prodigious cost in
planting walnut trees about his seat, and making fish ponds, many miles
in circuit, in Epping Forest, in a barren spot, as oftentimes these
suddenly monied men for the most part seat themselves.He from a
merchant's apprentice, and management of the East India Company's stock,
being arrived to an estate (it is said) of L200,000; and lately married
his daughter to the eldest son of the Duke of Beaufort, late Marquis of
Worcester, with L50,000 portional present, and various expectations.Houblon's, a rich and gentle French merchant, who was
building a house in the Forest, near Sir J. Child's, in a place where
the late Earl of Norwich dwelt some time, and which came from his lady,
the widow of Mr.It will be a pretty villa, about five miles from
Whitechapel.Horneck preach at the Savoy Church,
on Phil.He was a German born, a most pathetic preacher, a person
of a saint-like life, and hath written an excellent treatise on
Consideration.Whistler's, at the Physicians' College,
with Sir Thomas Millington, both learned men; Dr.W. the most facetious
man in nature, and now Censor of the college.I was here consulted where
they should build their library; it is a pity this college is built so
near Newgate Prison, and in so obscure a hole, a fault in placing most
of our public buildings and churches in the city, through the avarice of
some few men, and his Majesty not overruling it, when it was in his
power after the dreadful conflagration.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st March, 1683.Tenison preached at Whitehall on 1 Cor.12; I
esteem him to be one of the most profitable preachers in the Church of
England, being also of a most holy conversation, very learned and
ingenious.The pains he takes and care of his parish will, I fear, wear
him out, which would be an inexpressible loss.Charleton's lecture on the heart in
the Anatomy Theater at the Physicians' College.To London, in order to my passing the following week,
for the celebration of the Easter now approaching, there being in the
Holy Week so many eminent preachers officiating at the Court and other
places.[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th April, 1683.There was in the afternoon, according to
custom, a sermon before the King, at Whitehall; Dr.Sprat preached for
the Bishop of Rochester.I was at the launching of the last of the thirty ships
ordered to be newly built by Act of Parliament, named the "Neptune," a
second rate, one of the goodliest vessels of the whole navy, built by my
kind neighbor, young Mr.Shish, his Majesty's master shipwright of this
dock.I went to Blackheath, to see the new fair, being the
first procured by the Lord Dartmouth.This was the first day, pretended
for the sale of cattle, but I think in truth to enrich the new tavern at
the bowling-green, erected by Snape, his Majesty's farrier, a man full
of projects.There appeared nothing but an innumerable assembly of
drinking people from London, peddlars, etc., and I suppose it too near
London to be of any great use to the country.March was unusually hot and dry, and all April excessively wet.I planted all the out limits of the garden and long walks with
holly.[50]

    Muscovy."--"_Sylva_," book ii.Dined at Sir Gabriel Sylvius's and thence to visit the
Duke of Norfolk, to ask whether he would part with any of his cartoons
and other drawings of Raphael, and the great masters; he told me if he
might sell them all together he would, but that the late Sir Peter Lely
(our famous painter) had gotten some of his best.The person who desired
me to treat for them was Vander Douse, grandson to that great scholar,
contemporary and friend of Joseph Scaliger.Came to dinner and visited me Sir Richard Anderson, of
Pendley, and his lady, with whom I went to London.On my return home from the Royal Society, I found Mr.Wilbraham, a young gentleman of Cheshire.The Lord Dartmouth was elected Master of the Trinity
House; son to George Legge, late Master of the Ordnance, and one of the
grooms of the bedchamber; a great favorite of the Duke's, an active and
understanding gentleman in sea affairs.To our Society, where we received the Count de
Zinzendorp, Ambassador from the Duke of Saxony, a fine young man; we
showed him divers experiments on the magnet, on which subject the
Society were upon.I went to Windsor, dining by the way at Chiswick, at
Sir Stephen Fox's, where I found Sir Robert Howard (that universal
pretender), and Signor Verrio, who brought his draught and designs for
the painting of the staircase of Sir Stephen's new house.That which was new at Windsor since I was last there, and was surprising
to me, was the incomparable fresco painting in St.George's Hall,
representing the legend of St.George, and triumph of the Black Prince,
and his reception by Edward III.; the volto, or roof, not totally
finished; then the Resurrection in the Chapel, where the figure of the
Ascension is, in my opinion, comparable to any paintings of the most
famous Roman masters; the Last Supper, also over the altar.I liked the
contrivance of the unseen organ behind the altar, nor less the
stupendous and beyond all description the incomparable carving of our
Gibbons, who is, without controversy, the greatest master both for
invention and rareness of work, that the world ever had in any age; nor
doubt I at all that he will prove as great a master in the statuary art.Verrio's invention is admirable, his ordnance full and flowing, antique
and heroical; his figures move; and, if the walls hold (which is the
only doubt by reason of the salts which in time and in this moist
climate prejudice), the work will preserve his name to ages.There was now the terrace brought almost round the old castle; the
grass made clean, even, and curiously turfed; the avenues to the new
park, and other walks, planted with elms and limes, and a pretty canal,
and receptacle for fowl; nor less observable and famous is the throwing
so huge a quantity of excellent water to the enormous height of the
castle, for the use of the whole house, by an extraordinary invention of
Sir Samuel Morland.I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's with the Earls of
Bath, Castlehaven, Lords Viscounts Falconberg, Falkland, Bishop of
London, the Grand Master of Malta, brother to the Duke de Vendome (a
young wild spark), and Mr.After evening prayer, I
walked in the park with my Lord Clarendon, where we fell into discourse
of the Bishop of Salisbury (Dr.Seth Ward), his subtlety, etc.Durell, late Dean of Windsor, being dead, Dr.Turner, one of the Duke's
chaplains was made dean.I visited my Lady Arlington, groom of the stole to her Majesty, who
being hardly set down to supper, word was brought her that the Queen was
going into the park to walk, it being now near eleven at night; the
alarm caused the Countess to rise in all haste, and leave her supper to
us.By this one may take an estimate of the extreme slavery and subjection
that courtiers live in, who had not time to eat and drink at their
pleasure.It put me in mind of Horace's "Mouse," and to bless God for my
own private condition.Here was Monsieur de l'Angle, the famous minister of Charenton, lately
fled from the persecution in France, concerning the deplorable condition
of the Protestants there.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th June, 1683.I was present, and saw and heard the humble submission
and petition of the Lord Mayor, sheriffs, and aldermen, on behalf of the
city of London, on the _quo warranto_ against their charter which they
delivered to his Majesty in the presence chamber.It was delivered
kneeling, and then the King and Council went into the council chamber,
the mayor and his brethren attending still in the presence chamber.After a short space they were called in, and my Lord Keeper made a
speech to them, exaggerating the disorderly and riotous behavior in the
late election, and polling for Papillon and Du Bois after the Common
hall had been formally dissolved: with other misdemeanors, libels on the
government, etc., by which they had incurred his Majesty's high
displeasure: and that but for this submission, and under such articles
as the King should require their obedience to, he would certainly enter
judgment against them, which hitherto he had suspended.The things
required were as follows: that they should neither elect mayor,
sheriffs, aldermen, recorder, common Serjeant town clerk, coroner, nor
steward of Southwark, without his Majesty's approbation; and that if
they presented any his Majesty did not like, they should proceed in
wonted manner to a second choice; if that was disapproved, his Majesty
to nominate them; and if within five days they thought good to assent to
this, all former miscarriages should be forgotten.And so they tamely
parted with their so ancient privileges after they had dined and been
treated by the King.What
the consequences will prove, time will show.Divers of the old and most
learned lawyers and judges were of opinion that they could not forfeit
their charter, but might be personally punished for their misdemeanors;
but the plurality of the younger judges and rising men judged it
otherwise.The Popish Plot also, which had hitherto made such a noise, began now
sensibly to dwindle, through the folly, knavery, impudence, and
giddiness of Oates, so as the <DW7>s began to hold up their heads
higher than ever, and those who had fled, flocked to London from abroad.Such sudden changes and eager doings there had been without anything
steady or prudent, for these last seven years.I returned to town in a coach with the Earl of
Clarendon, when passing by the glorious palace of his father, built but
a few years before, which they were now demolishing, being sold to
certain undertakers, I turned my head the contrary way till the coach
had gone past it, lest I might minister occasion of speaking of it;
which must needs have grieved him, that in so short a time their pomp
was fallen.After the Popish Plot, there was now a new and (as
they called it) a Protestant Plot discovered, that certain Lords and
others should design the assassination of the King and the Duke as they
were to come from Newmarket, with a general rising of the nation, and
especially of the city of London, disaffected to the present Government.Upon which were committed to the Tower, the Lord Russell, eldest son of
the Earl of Bedford, the Earl of Essex, Mr.Algernon Sidney, son to the
old Earl of Leicester, Mr.Trenchard, Hampden, Lord Howard of Escrick,
and others.A proclamation was issued against my Lord Grey, the Duke of
Monmouth, Sir Thomas Armstrong, and one Ferguson, who had escaped beyond
sea; of these some were said to be for killing the King, others for only
seizing on him, and persuading him to new counsels, on the pretense of
the danger of Popery, should the Duke live to succeed, who was now again
admitted to the councils and cabinet secrets.The Lords Essex and
Russell were much deplored, for believing they had any evil intention
against the King, or the Church; some thought they were cunningly drawn
in by their enemies for not approving some late counsels and management
relating to France, to Popery, to the persecution of the Dissenters,
etc.They were discovered by the Lord Howard of Escrick and some false
brethren of the club, and the design happily broken; had it taken
effect, it would, to all appearance, have exposed the Government to
unknown and dangerous events; which God avert!Was born my granddaughter at Sayes Court, and christened by the name of
Martha Maria, our Vicar officiating.I pray God bless her, and may she
choose the better part![Sidenote: LONDON]

13th July, 1683.As I was visiting Sir Thomas Yarborough and his Lady,
in Covent Garden, the astonishing news was brought to us of the Earl of
Essex having cut his throat, having been but three days a prisoner in
the Tower, and this happened on the very day and instant that Lord
Russell was on his trial, and had sentence of death.This accident
exceedingly amazed me, my Lord Essex being so well known by me to be a
person of such sober and religious deportment, so well at his ease, and
so much obliged to the King.It is certain the King and Duke were at the
Tower, and passed by his window about the same time this morning, when
my Lord asking for a razor, shut himself into a closet, and perpetrated
the horrid act.Yet it was wondered by some how it was possible he
should do it in the manner he was found, for the wound was so deep and
wide, that being cut through the gullet, windpipe, and both the
jugulars, it reached to the very vertebrae of the neck, so that the head
held to it by a very little skin as it were; the gapping too of the
razor, and cutting his own fingers, was a little strange; but more, that
having passed the jugulars he should have strength to proceed so far,
that an executioner could hardly have done more with an ax.The fatal news coming to Hicks's Hall upon the article of my Lord
Russell's trial, was said to have had no little influence on the Jury
and all the Bench to his prejudice.Others said that he had himself on
some occasions hinted that in case he should be in danger of having his
life taken from him by any public misfortune, those who thirsted for his
estate should miss of their aim; and that he should speak favorably of
that Earl of Northumberland,[51] and some others, who made away with
themselves; but these are discourses so unlike his sober and prudent
conversation that I have no inclination to credit them.What might
instigate him to this devilish act, I am not able to conjecture.My Lord
Clarendon, his brother-in-law, who was with him but the day before,
assured me he was then very cheerful, and declared it to be the effect
of his innocence and loyalty; and most believe that his Majesty had no
severe intentions against him, though he was altogether inexorable as to
Lord Russell and some of the rest.For my part, I believe the crafty and
ambitious Earl of Shaftesbury had brought them into some dislike of the
present carriage of matters at Court, not with any design of destroying
the monarchy (which Shaftesbury had in confidence and for unanswerable
reasons told me he would support to his last breath, as having seen and
felt the misery of being under mechanic tyranny), but perhaps of setting
up some other whom he might govern, and frame to his own platonic fancy,
without much regard to the religion established under the hierarchy, for
which he had no esteem; but when he perceived those whom he had engaged
to rise, fail of his expectations, and the day past, reproaching his
accomplices that a second day for an exploit of this nature was never
successful, he gave them the slip, and got into Holland, where the fox
died, three months before these unhappy Lords and others were discovered
or suspected.Every one deplored Essex and Russell, especially the last,
as being thought to have been drawn in on pretense only of endeavoring
to rescue the King from his present councilors, and secure religion from
Popery, and the nation from arbitrary government, now so much
apprehended; while the rest of those who were fled, especially Ferguson
and his gang, had doubtless some bloody design to get up a Commonwealth,
and turn all things topsy-turvy.Of the same tragical principles is
Sydney.[Footnote 51: Henry Percy, eighth Earl of Northumberland, shot
    himself in the Tower, to which he had been committed on a charge of
    high treason in June, 1585.]I had this day much discourse with Monsieur Pontaq, son to the famous
and wise prime President of Bordeaux.This gentleman was owner of that
excellent _vignoble_ of Pontaq and O'Brien, from whence come the
choicest of our Bordeaux wines; and I think I may truly say of him, what
was not so truly said of St.Paul, that much learning had made him mad.He had studied well in philosophy, but chiefly the Rabbins, and was
exceedingly addicted to cabalistical fancies, an eternal hablador
[romancer], and half distracted by reading abundance of the extravagant
Eastern Jews.He spoke all languages, was very rich, had a handsome
person, and was well bred, about forty-five years of age.Fraser, a learned Scotch gentleman, whom
I had formerly recommended to Lord Berkeley for the instruction and
government of his son, since dead at sea.He had now been in Holland at
the sale of the learned Heinsius's library, and showed me some very rare
and curious books, and some MSS., which he had purchased to good value.There were three or four Herbals in miniature, accurately done, divers
Roman antiquities of Verona, and very many books of Aldus's impression.A stranger, an old man, preached on Jerem.8, the
not hearkening to instruction, portentous of desolation to a people;
much after Bishop Andrew's method, full of logical divisions, in short
and broken periods, and Latin sentences, now quite out of fashion in the
pulpit, which is grown into a far more profitable way, of plain and
practical discourses, of which sort this nation, or any other, never had
greater plenty or more profitable (I am confident); so much has it to
answer for thriving no better on it.The public was now in great consternation on the late plot and
conspiracy; his Majesty very melancholy, and not stirring without double
guards; all the avenues and private doors about Whitehall and the Park
shut up, few admitted to walk in it.The <DW7>s, in the meantime, very
jocund; and indeed with reason, seeing their own plot brought to
nothing, and turned to ridicule, and now a conspiracy of Protestants, as
they called them.The Turks were likewise in hostility against the German Emperor, almost
masters of the Upper Hungary, and drawing toward Vienna.On the other
side, the French King (who it is believed brought in the infidels)
disturbing his Spanish and Dutch neighbors, having swallowed up almost
all Flanders, pursuing his ambition of a fifth universal monarchy; and
all this blood and disorder in Christendom had evidently its rise from
our defections at home, in a wanton peace, minding nothing but luxury,
ambition, and to procure money for our vices.To this add our irreligion
and atheism, great ingratitude, and self-interest; the apostacy of some,
and the suffering the French to grow so great, and the Hollanders so
weak.In a word, we were wanton, mad, and surfeiting with prosperity;
every moment unsettling the old foundations, and never constant to
anything.The Lord in mercy avert the sad omen, and that we do not
provoke him till he bear it no longer!This summer did we suffer twenty French men-of-war to pass our Channel
toward the Sound, to help the Danes against the Swedes, who had
abandoned the French interest, we not having ready sufficient to guard
our coasts, or take cognizance of what they did; though the nation never
had more, or a better navy, yet the sea had never so slender a fleet.George, Prince of Denmark, who had landed this day,
came to marry the Lady Anne, daughter to the Duke; so I returned home,
having seen the young gallant at dinner at Whitehall.Several of the conspirators of the lower form were
executed at Tyburn; and the next day,

[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st July, 1683.Lord Russell was beheaded in Lincoln's Inn Fields, the
executioner giving him three butcherly strokes.The speech he made, and
the paper which he gave the Sheriff declaring his innocence, the
nobleness of the family, the piety and worthiness of the unhappy
gentleman, wrought much pity, and occasioned various discourses on the
plot.I again saw Prince George of Denmark: he had the Danish
countenance, blonde, of few words, spoke French but ill, seemed somewhat
heavy, but reported to be valiant, and indeed he had bravely rescued and
brought off his brother, the King of Denmark, in a battle against the
Swedes, when both these Kings were engaged very smartly.He was married to the Lady Anne at Whitehall.Her Court

cousin-german of the late Lord Russell, came to visit me, and condole
his sad fate.The next day, came Colonel Russell, uncle to the late Lord
Russell, and brother to the Earl of Bedford, and with him Mrs.Middleton, that famous and indeed incomparable beauty, daughter to my
relation, Sir Robert Needham.I went to Bromley to visit our Bishop, and excellent
neighbor, and to congratulate his now being made Archbishop of York.On
the 28th, he came to take his leave of us, now preparing for his journey
and residence in his province.My sweet little grandchild, Martha Maria, died, and
on the 29th was buried in the parish church.This morning, was read in the church, after the
office was done, the Declaration setting forth the late conspiracy
against the King's person.I went to see what had been done by the Duke of
Beaufort on his lately purchased house at Chelsea, which I once had the
selling of for the Countess of Bristol, he had made great alterations,
but might have built a better house with the materials and the cost he
had been at.Saw the Countess of Monte Feltre, whose husband I had formerly known,
he was a subject of the Pope's, but becoming a Protestant he resided in
England, and married into the family of the Savilles, of Yorkshire.The
Count, her late husband, was a very learned gentleman, a great
politician, and a goodly man.She was accompanied by her sister,
exceedingly skilled in painting, nor did they spare for color on their
own faces.It being the day of public thanksgiving for his
Majesty's late preservation, the former Declaration was again read, and
there was an office used, composed for the occasion.A loyal sermon was
preached on the divine right of Kings, from Psalm cxliv."Thou hast
preserved David from the peril of the sword."Came to visit me the learned anatomist, Dr.Tyson,[52] with some other Fellows of our Society.[Footnote 52: Doctor Edward Tyson, a learned physician, born at
    Clevedon, Somersetshire, in 1649, who became reader of the
    anatomical lecture in Surgeons' Hall, and physician to the hospitals
    of Bethlehem and Bridewell, which offices he held at his death, Aug.He was an ingenious writer, and has left various Essays in
    the Philosophical Transactions and Hook's Collections.He published
    also "The Anatomy of a Porpoise Dissected at Gresham College," and
    "The Anatomy of a Pigmy Compared with a Monkey, an Ape, and a Man,"
    4to., 1698-99.]At the elegant villa and garden of Mr.He showed me the zinnar tree, or platanus, and told me that since
they had planted this kind of tree about the city of Ispahan, in Persia,
the plague, which formerly much infested the place, had exceedingly
abated of its mortal effects, and rendered it very healthy.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th September, 1683.I went to London to visit the Duchess of Grafton,
now great with child, a most virtuous and beautiful lady.Dining with
her at my Lord Chamberlain's, met my Lord of St.Alban's, now grown so
blind, that he could not see to take his meat.He has lived a most easy
life, in plenty even abroad, while his Majesty was a sufferer; he has
lost immense sums at play, which yet, at about eighty years old, he
continues, having one that sits by him to name the spots on the cards.He is a prudent old
courtier, and much enriched since his Majesty's return.After dinner, I walked to survey the sad demolition of Clarendon House,
that costly and only sumptuous palace of the late Lord Chancellor Hyde,
where I have often been so cheerful with him, and sometimes so sad:
happening to make him a visit but the day before he fled from the angry
Parliament, accusing him of maladministration, and being envious at his
grandeur, who from a private lawyer came to be father-in-law to the Duke
of York, and as some would suggest, designing his Majesty's marriage
with the Infanta of Portugal, not apt to breed.To this they imputed
much of our unhappiness; and that he, being sole minister and favorite
at his Majesty's restoration, neglected to gratify the King's suffering
party, preferring those who were the cause of our troubles.But perhaps
as many of these things were injuriously laid to his charge, so he kept
the government far steadier than it has proved since.I could name some
who I think contributed greatly to his ruin,--the buffoons and the
MISSIS, to whom he was an eye-sore.It is true he was of a jolly temper,
after the old English fashion; but France had now the ascendant, and we
were become quite another nation.The Chancellor gone, and dying in
exile, the Earl his successor sold that which cost L50,000 building, to
the young Duke of Albemarle for L25,000, to pay debts which how
contracted remains yet a mystery, his son being no way a prodigal.Some
imagine the Duchess his daughter had been chargeable to him.However it
were, this stately palace is decreed to ruin, to support the prodigious
waste the Duke of Albemarle had made of his estate, since the old man
died.He sold it to the highest bidder, and it fell to certain rich
bankers and mechanics, who gave for it and the ground about it, L35,000;
they design a new town, as it were, and a most magnificent piazza
[square].It is said they have already materials toward it with what
they sold of the house alone, more worth than what they paid for it.See
the vicissitudes of earthly things!I was astonished at this demolition,
nor less at the little army of laborers and artificers leveling the
ground, laying foundations, and contriving great buildings at an expense
of L200,000, if they perfect their design.In my walks I stepped into a goldbeater's
workhouse, where he showed me the wonderful ductility of that spreading
and oily metal.He said it must be finer than the standard, such as was
old angel-gold, and that of such he had once to the value of L100
stamped with the _agnus dei_, and coined at the time of the holy war;
which had been found in a ruined wall somewhere in the North, near to
Scotland, some of which he beat into leaves, and the rest sold to the
curiosi in antiquities and medals.We had now the welcome tidings of the King of
Poland raising the siege of Vienna, which had given terror to all
Europe, and utmost reproach to the French, who it is believed brought in
the Turks for diversion, that the French King might the more easily
swallow Flanders, and pursue his unjust conquest on the empire, while we
sat unconcerned and under a deadly charm from somebody.There was this day a collection for rebuilding Newmarket, consumed by an
accidental fire, which removing his Majesty thence sooner than was
intended, put by the assassins, who were disappointed of their
rendezvous and expectation by a wonderful providence.This made the King
more earnest to render Winchester the seat of his autumnal field
diversions for the future, designing a palace there, where the ancient
castle stood; infinitely indeed preferable to Newmarket for prospects,
air, pleasure, and provisions.The surveyor has already begun the
foundation for a palace, estimated to cost L35,000, and his Majesty is
purchasing ground about it to make a park, etc.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th October, 1683.I went to London, on receiving a note from the
Countess of Arlington, of some considerable charge or advantage I might
obtain by applying myself to his Majesty on this signal conjuncture of
his Majesty entering up judgment against the city charter; the proposal
made me I wholly declined, not being well satisfied with these violent
transactions, and not a little sorry that his Majesty was so often put
upon things of this nature against so great a city, the consequence
whereof may be so much to his prejudice; so I returned home.At this
time, the Lord Chief-Justice Pemberton was displaced.He was held to be
the most learned of the judges, and an honest man.Sir George Jeffreys
was advanced, reputed to be most ignorant, but most daring.Sir George
Treby, Recorder of London, was also put by, and one Genner, an obscure
lawyer, set in his place.Eight of the richest and chief aldermen were
removed and all the rest made only justices of the peace, and no more
wearing of gowns, or chains of gold; the Lord Mayor and two sheriffs
holding their places by new grants as _custodes_, at the King's
pleasure.The pomp and grandeur of the most august city in the world
thus changed face in a moment; which gave great occasion of discourse
and thoughts of hearts, what all this would end in.Prudent men were for
the old foundations.Following his Majesty this morning through the gallery, I went with the
few who attended him, into the Duchess of Portmouth's DRESSING ROOM
within her bedchamber, where she was in her morning loose garment, her
maids combing her, newly out of her bed, his Majesty and the gallants
standing about her; but that which engaged my curiosity, was the rich
and splendid furniture of this woman's apartment, now twice or thrice
pulled down and rebuilt to satisfy her prodigal and expensive pleasures,
while her Majesty's does not exceed some gentlemen's ladies in furniture
and accommodation.Here I saw the new fabric of French tapestry, for
design, tenderness of work, and incomparable imitation of the best
paintings, beyond anything I had ever beheld.Some pieces had
Versailles, St.Germains, and other palaces of the French King, with
huntings, figures, and landscapes, exotic fowls, and all to the life
rarely done.Then for Japan cabinets, screens, pendule clocks, great
vases of wrought plate, tables, stands, chimney-furniture, sconces,
branches, braseras, etc., all of massy silver and out of number, besides
some of her Majesty's best paintings.Surfeiting of this, I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's and went contented home
to my poor, but quiet villa.What contentment can there be in the riches
and splendor of this world, purchased with vice and dishonor?Visited the Duchess of Grafton, not yet brought to
bed, and dining with my Lord Chamberlain (her father), went with them to
see Montague House, a palace lately built by Lord Montague, who had
married the most beautiful Countess of Northumberland.It is a stately
and ample palace.Signor Verrio's fresco paintings, especially the
funeral pile of Dido, on the staircase, the labors of Hercules, fight
with the Centaurs, his effeminacy with Dejanira, and Apotheosis or
reception among the gods, on the walls and roof of the great room
above,--I think exceeds anything he has yet done, both for design,
coloring, and exuberance of invention, comparable to the greatest of the
old masters, or what they so celebrate at Rome.In the rest of the
chamber are some excellent paintings of Holbein, and other masters.The
garden is large, and in good air, but the fronts of the house not
answerable to the inside.The court at entry, and wings for offices seem
too near the street, and that so very narrow and meanly built, that the
corridor is not in proportion to the rest, to hide the court from being
overlooked by neighbors; all which might have been prevented, had they
placed the house further into the ground, of which there was enough to
spare.But on the whole it is a fine palace, built after the French
pavilion-way, by Mr.Hooke, the Curator of the Royal Society.There were
with us my Lady Scroope, the great wit, and Monsieur Chardine, the
celebrated traveler.Came to visit me my old and worthy friend, Mr.Packer, bringing with him his nephew Berkeley, grandson to the honest
judge.A most ingenious, virtuous, and religious gentleman, seated near
Worcester, and very curious in gardening.I was at the court-leet of this manor, my Lord
Arlington his Majesty's High Steward.Came to visit and dine with me, Mr.Brisbane,
Secretary to the Admiralty, a learned and agreeable man.I went to Kew to visit Sir Henry Capell, brother to
the late Earl of Essex; but he being gone to Cashiobury, after I had
seen his garden and the alterations therein, I returned home.He had
repaired his house, roofed his hall with a kind of cupola, and in a
niche was an artificial fountain; but the room seems to me
over-melancholy, yet might be much improved by having the walls well
painted _a fresco_.The two green houses for oranges and myrtles,
communicating with the rooms below, are very well contrived.There is a
cupola made with pole-work between two elms at the end of a walk, which
being covered by plashing the trees to them, is very pretty; for the
rest there are too many fir trees in the garden.[Sidenote: LONDON]

17th November, 1683.I took a house in Villiers Street, York Buildings,
for the winter, having many important concerns to dispatch, and for the
education of my daughters.The Duke of Monmouth, till now proclaimed traitor on
the pretended plot for which Lord Russell was lately beheaded, came this
evening to Whitehall and rendered himself, on which were various
discourses.I went to compliment the Duchess of Grafton, now
lying-in of her first child, a son, which she called for, that I might
see it.She was become more beautiful, if it were possible, than before,
and full of virtue and sweetness.She discoursed with me of many
particulars, with great prudence and gravity beyond her years.Forbes showed me the plot of the garden making
at Burleigh, at my Lord Exeter's, which I looked on as one of the most
noble that I had seen.The whole court and town in solemn mourning for the death of the King of
Portugal, her Majesty's brother.At the anniversary dinner of the Royal Society the
King sent us two does.I was this day invited to a wedding of one Mrs.Castle, to whom I had some obligation, and it was to her fifth husband,
a lieutenant-colonel of the city.She was the daughter of one Burton, a
broom-man, by his wife, who sold kitchen stuff in Kent Street, whom God
so blessed that the father became a very rich, and was a very honest
man; he was sheriff of Surrey, where I have sat on the bench with him.Another of his daughters was married to Sir John Bowles; and this
daughter was a jolly friendly woman.There was at the wedding the Lord
Mayor, the Sheriff, several Aldermen and persons of quality; above all,
Sir George Jeffreys, newly made Lord Chief Justice of England, with Mr.Justice Withings, danced with the bride, and were exceedingly merry.These great men spent the rest of the afternoon, till eleven at night,
in drinking healths, taking tobacco, and talking much beneath the
gravity of judges, who had but a day or two before condemned Mr.Algernon Sidney, who was executed the 7th on Tower Hill, on the single
witness of that monster of a man, Lord Howard of Escrick, and some
sheets of paper taken in Mr.Sidney's study, pretended to be written by
him, but not fully proved, nor the time when, but appearing to have been
written before his Majesty's Restoration, and then pardoned by the Act
of Oblivion; so that though Mr.Sidney was known to be a person
obstinately averse to government by a monarch (the subject of the paper
was in answer to one by Sir E. Filmer), yet it was thought he had very
hard measure.There is this yet observable, that he had been an
inveterate enemy to the last king, and in actual rebellion against him;
a man of great courage, great sense, great parts, which he showed both
at his trial and death; for, when he came on the scaffold, instead of a
speech, he told them only that he had made his peace with God, that he
came not thither to talk, but to die; put a paper into the sheriff's
hand, and another into a friend's; said one prayer as short as a grace,
laid down his neck, and bid the executioner do his office.The Duke of Monmouth, now having his pardon, refuses to acknowledge
there was any treasonable plot; for which he is banished Whitehall.This
is a great disappointment to some who had prosecuted Trenchard, Hampden,
etc., that for want of a second witness were come out of the Tower upon
their _habeas corpus_.The King had now augmented his guards with a new sort of dragoons, who
carried also grenades, and were habited after the Polish manner, with
long peaked caps, very fierce and fantastical.[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th December, 1683.I went to the Tower, and visited the Earl of Danby,
the late Lord High Treasurer, who had been imprisoned four years: he
received me with great kindness.I dined with him, and stayed till
night.We had discourse of many things, his Lady railing sufficiently at
the keeping her husband so long in prison.Here I saluted the Lord
Dumblaine's wife, who before had been married to Emerton, and about whom
there was that scandalous business before the delegates.The smallpox very prevalent and mortal; the Thames
frozen.I dined at Lord Clarendon's, where I was to meet
that ingenious and learned gentleman, Sir George Wheeler, who has
published the excellent description of Africa and Greece, and who, being
a knight of a very fair estate and young, had now newly entered into
holy orders.I went to visit Sir John Chardin, a French
gentleman, who traveled three times by land into Persia, and had made
many curious researches in his travels, of which he was now setting
forth a relation.It being in England this year one of the severest
frosts that has happened of many years, he told me the cold in Persia
was much greater, the ice of an incredible thickness; that they had
little use of iron in all that country, it being so moist (though the
air admirably clear and healthy) that oil would not preserve it from
rusting, so that they had neither clocks nor watches; some padlocks they
had for doors and boxes.Sprat, now made Dean of Westminster, preached
to the King at Whitehall, on Matt.Recollecting the passages of
the past year, I gave God thanks for his mercies, praying his blessing
for the future.The weather continuing intolerably severe, streets
of booths were set up on the Thames; the air was so very cold and thick,
as of many years there had not been the like.I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's: after dinner came a
fellow who ate live charcoal, glowingly ignited, quenching them in his
mouth, and then champing and swallowing them down.There was a dog also
which seemed to do many rational actions.I went across the Thames on the ice, now become so
thick as to bear not only streets of booths, in which they roasted meat,
and had divers shops of wares, quite across as in a town, but coaches,
carts, and horses passed over.So I went from Westminster stairs to
Lambeth, and dined with the Archbishop: where I met my Lord Bruce, Sir
George Wheeler, Colonel Cooke, and several divines.After dinner and
discourse with his Grace till evening prayers, Sir George Wheeler and I
walked over the ice from Lambeth stairs to the Horse-ferry.I visited Sir Robert Reading, where after supper we
had music, but not comparable to that which Mrs.Bridgeman made us on
the guitar with such extraordinary skill and dexterity.The Thames was filled with people and tents selling
all sorts of wares as in the city.The frost continues more and more severe, the Thames
before London was still planted with booths in formal streets, all sorts
of trades and shops furnished, and full of commodities, even to a
printing press, where the people and ladies took a fancy to have their
names printed, and the day and year set down when printed on the Thames:
this humor took so universally, that it was estimated that the printer
gained L5 a day, for printing a line only, at sixpence a name, besides
what he got by ballads, etc.Coaches plied from Westminster to the
Temple, and from several other stairs to and fro, as in the streets,
sleds, sliding with skates, a bull-baiting, horse and coach-races,
puppet-plays and interludes, cooks, tippling, and other lewd places, so
that it seemed to be a bacchanalian triumph, or carnival on the water,
while it was a severe judgment on the land, the trees not only splitting
as if the lightning struck, but men and cattle perishing in divers
places, and the very seas so locked up with ice, that no vessels could
stir out or come in.The fowls, fish, and birds, and all our exotic
plants and greens, universally perishing.Many parks of deer were
destroyed, and all sorts of fuel so dear, that there were great
contributions to preserve the poor alive.Nor was this severe weather
much less intense in most parts of Europe, even as far as Spain and the
most southern tracts.London, by reason of the excessive coldness of the
air hindering the ascent of the smoke, was so filled with the fuliginous
steam of the sea-coal, that hardly could one see across the street, and
this filling the lungs with its gross particles, exceedingly obstructed
the breast, so as one could scarcely breathe.Here was no water to be
had from the pipes and engines, nor could the brewers and divers other
tradesmen work, and every moment was full of disastrous accidents.I went to Sayes Court to see how the frost had
dealt with my garden, where I found many of the greens and rare plants
utterly destroyed.The oranges and myrtles very sick, the rosemary and
laurels dead to all appearance, but the cypress likely to endure it.It began to thaw, but froze again.My coach crossed
from Lambeth, to the Horse-ferry at Milbank, Westminster.The booths
were almost all taken down; but there was first a map or landscape cut
in copper representing all the manner of the camp, and the several
actions, sports, and pastimes thereon, in memory of so signal a frost.I dined with my Lord Keeper, [North], and walking
alone with him some time in his gallery, we had discourse of music.He
told me he had been brought up to it from a child, so as to sing his
part at first sight.Then speaking of painting, of which he was also a
great lover, and other ingenious matters, he desired me to come oftener
to him.I went this evening to visit that great and knowing
virtuoso, Monsieur Justell.The weather was set in to an absolute thaw
and rain; but the Thames still frozen.After eight weeks missing the foreign posts, there
came abundance of intelligence from abroad.[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th February, 1684.The Earl of Danby, late Lord-Treasurer, together
with the Roman Catholic Lords impeached of high treason in the Popish
Plot, had now their _habeas corpus_, and came out upon bail, after five
years' imprisonment in the Tower.Then were also tried and deeply fined
Mr.Hampden and others, for being supposed of the late plot, for which
Lord Russell and Colonel Sidney suffered; as also the person who went
about to prove that the Earl of Essex had his throat cut in the Tower by
others; likewise Mr.Johnson, the author of that famous piece called
Julian.News of the Prince of Orange having accused the
Deputies of Amsterdam of _crimen laesae Majestatis_, and being pensioners
to France.Tenison communicated to me his intention of erecting a library in
St.Martin's parish, for the public use, and desired my assistance, with
Sir Christopher Wren, about the placing and structure thereof, a worthy
and laudable design.He told me there were thirty or forty young men in
Orders in his parish, either governors to young gentlemen or chaplains
to noblemen, who being reproved by him on occasion for frequenting
taverns or coffeehouses, told him they would study or employ their time
better, if they had books.This put the pious Doctor on this design; and
indeed a great reproach it is that so great a city as London should not
have a public library becoming it.Paul's;
the west end of that church (if ever finished) would be a convenient
place.I went to Sir John Chardin, who desired my
assistance for the engraving the plates, the translation, and printing
his History of that wonderful Persian Monument near Persepolis, and
other rare antiquities, which he had caused to be drawn from the
originals in his second journey into Persia, which we now concluded
upon.Afterward, I went with Sir Christopher Wren to Dr.Tenison, where
we made the drawing and estimate of the expense of the library, to be
begun this next spring near the Mews.Great expectation of the Prince of Orange's attempts in Holland to bring
those of Amsterdam to consent to the new levies, to which we were no
friends, by a pseudo-politic adherence to the French interest.Turner, our new Bishop of
Rochester.I dined at Lady Tuke's, where I heard Dr.Walgrave
(physician to the Duke and Duchess) play excellently on the lute.Meggot, Dean of Winchester, preached an
incomparable sermon (the King being now gone to Newmarket), on Heb.15, showing and pathetically pressing the care we ought to have lest we
come short of the grace of God.Tenison
at Kensington, whither he was retired to refresh, after he had been sick
of the smallpox.Henry Godolphin, a prebend
of St.Paul's, and brother to my dear friend Sydney, on Isaiah 1v.I
dined at the Lord Keeper's, and brought him to Sir John Chardin, who
showed him his accurate drafts of his travels in Persia.There was so great a concourse of people with their
children to be touched for the Evil, that six or seven were crushed to
death by pressing at the chirurgeon's door for tickets.The weather
began to be more mild and tolerable; but there was not the least
appearance of any spring.The Bishop of Rochester preached before
the King; after which his Majesty, accompanied with three of his natural
sons, the Dukes of Northumberland, Richmond, and St.Alban (sons of
Portsmouth, Cleveland, and Nelly), went up to the altar; the three boys
entering before the King within the rails, at the right hand, and three
bishops on the left: London (who officiated), Durham, and Rochester,
with the subdean, Dr.The King, kneeling before the altar,
making his offering, the Bishops first received, and then his Majesty;
after which he retired to a canopied seat on the right hand.Note, there
was perfume burned before the office began.I had received the Sacrament
at Whitehall early with the Lords and household, the Bishop of London
officiating.Tenison preached
(recovered from the smallpox); then went again to Whitehall as above.I returned home with my family to my house at Sayes
Court, after five months' residence in London; hardly the least
appearance of any spring.A letter of mine to the Royal Society concerning the
terrible effects of the past winter being read, they desired it might be
printed in the next part of their "Transactions."[Sidenote: SURREY]

10th May, 1684.Called by the way
at Ashted, where Sir Robert Howard (Auditor of the Exchequer)
entertained me very civilly at his newly-built house, which stands in a
park on the Down, the avenue south; though down hill to the house, which
is not great, but with the outhouses very convenient.The staircase is
painted by Verrio with the story of Astrea; among other figures is the
picture of the painter himself, and not unlike him; the rest is well
done, only the columns did not at all please me; there is also Sir
Robert's own picture in an oval; the whole in _fresco_.The place has
this great defect, that there is no water but what is drawn up by horses
from a very deep well.Higham, who was ill, and died three days
after.His grandfather and father (who christened me), with himself, had
now been rectors of this parish 101 years, viz, from May, 1583.I returned to London, where I found the Commissioners of
the Admiralty abolished, and the office of Admiral restored to the Duke,
as to the disposing and ordering all sea business; but his Majesty
signed all petitions, papers, warrants, and commissions, that the Duke,
not acting as admiral by commission or office, might not incur the
penalty of the late Act against <DW7>s and Dissenters holding offices,
and refusing the oath and test.Every one was glad of this change, those
in the late Commission being utterly ignorant in their duty, to the
great damage of the Navy.The utter ruin of the Low Country was threatened by the siege of
Luxemburg, if not timely relieved, and by the obstinacy of the
Hollanders, who refused to assist the Prince of Orange, being corrupted
by the French.I received L600 of Sir Charles Bickerstaff for the fee
farm of Pilton, in Devon.Lord Dartmouth was chosen Master of the Trinity Company,
newly returned with the fleet from blowing up and demolishing Tangier.In the sermon preached on this occasion, Dr.Can observed that, in the
27th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, the casting anchor out of the
fore ship had been caviled at as betraying total ignorance: that it is
very true our seamen do not do so; but in the Mediterranean their ships
were built differently from ours, and to this day it was the practice to
do so there.Luxemburg was surrendered to the French, which makes them master of all
the Netherlands, gives them entrance into Germany, and a fair game for
universal monarchy; which that we should suffer, who only and easily
might have hindered, astonished all the world.Thus is the poor Prince
of Orange ruined, and this nation and all the Protestant interest in
Europe following, unless God in his infinite mercy, as by a miracle,
interpose, and our great ones alter their counsels.The French fleet
were now besieging Genoa, but after burning much of that beautiful city
with their bombs, went off with disgrace.My cousin, Verney, to whom a very great fortune was
fallen, came to take leave of us, going into the country; a very worthy
and virtuous young gentleman.I went to advise and give directions about the building
of two streets in Berkeley Garden, reserving the house and as much of
the garden as the breadth of the house.In the meantime, I could not but
deplore that sweet place (by far the most noble gardens, courts, and
accommodations, stately porticos, etc., anywhere about the town) should
be so much straitened and turned into tenements.But that magnificent
pile and gardens contiguous to it, built by the late Lord Chancellor
Clarendon, being all demolished, and designed for piazzas and buildings,
was some excuse for my Lady Berkeley's resolution of letting out her
ground also for so excessive a price as was offered, advancing near
L1,000 per annum in mere ground rents; to such a mad intemperance was
the age come of building about a city, by far too disproportionate
already to the nation:[53] I having in my time seen it almost as large
again as it was within my memory.[Footnote 53: What would Evelyn think if he could see what is now
    called London?]Last Friday, Sir Thomas Armstrong was executed at Tyburn
for treason, without trial, having been outlawed and apprehended in
Holland, on the conspiracy of the Duke of Monmouth, Lord Russell, etc.,
which gave occasion of discourse to people and lawyers, in regard it was
on an outlawry that judgment was given and execution.[54]

    [Footnote 54: When brought up for judgment, Armstrong insisted on
    his right to a trial, the act giving that right to those who came in
    within a year, and the year not having expired.Jefferies refused
    it; and when Armstrong insisted that he asked nothing but law,
    Jefferies told him he should have it to the full, and ordered his
    execution in six days.When Jefferies went to the King at Windsor
    soon after, the King took a ring from his finger and gave it to
    Jefferies.[Sidenote: GREENWICH]

2d July, 1684.I went to the Observatory at Greenwich, where Mr.Flamsted took his observations of the eclipse of the sun, now almost
three parts obscured.There had been an excessively hot and dry spring, and such a drought
still continued as never was in my memory.Some small sprinkling of rain; the leaves dropping
from the trees as in autumn.I dined at Lord Falkland's, Treasurer of the Navy,
where after dinner we had rare music, there being among others, Signor
Pietro Reggio, and Signor John Baptist, both famous, one for his voice,
the other for playing on the harpsichord, few if any in Europe exceeding
him.There was also a Frenchman who sung an admirable bass.I returned home, where I found my Lord Chief Justice
[Jefferies], the Countess of Clarendon, and Lady Catherine Fitzgerald,
who dined with me.We had now rain after such a drought as no man in
England had known.We had not had above one or two
considerable showers, and those storms, these eight or nine months.Many
trees died for the want of refreshment.Sidney Godolphin was made Baron Godolphin.The King being returned from Winchester, there was
a numerous Court at Whitehall.At this time the Earl of Rochester was removed from the Treasury to the
Presidentship of the Council; Lord Godolphin was made first Commissioner
of the Treasury in his place, Lord Middleton (a Scot) made Secretary of
State, in the room of Lord Godolphin.These alterations being very
unexpected and mysterious, gave great occasion of discourse.There was now an Ambassador from the King of Siam, in the East Indies,
to his Majesty.I went with Sir William Godolphin to see the
rhinoceros, or unicorn, being the first that I suppose was ever brought
into England.She belonged to some East India merchants, and was sold
(as I remember) for above L2,000.At the same time, I went to see a
crocodile, brought from some of the West India Islands, resembling the
Egyptian crocodile.I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's with the Duke of
Northumberland.He seemed to be a young gentleman of good capacity, well
bred, civil and modest: newly come from travel, and had made his
campaign at the siege of Luxemburg.Of all his Majesty's children (of
which he had now six Dukes) this seemed the most accomplished and worth
the owning.What the
Dukes of Richmond and St.Alban's will prove, their youth does not yet
discover; they are very pretty boys.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th October, 1684.Goodman preached before the King on James ii.12, concerning the law of liberty: an excellent discourse and in good
method.He is author of "The Prodigal Son," a treatise worth reading,
and another of the old religion.I visited the Lord Chamberlain, where dined the
BLACK BARON and Monsieur Flamerin, who had so long been banished from
France for a duel.I carried Lord Clarendon through the city amid all
the squibs and bacchanalia of the Lord Mayor's show, to the Royal
Society, where he was proposed a member; and then treated him at dinner.Clement's, that prettily built and contrived church where
a young divine gave us an eloquent sermon on 1 Cor.20, inciting to
gratitude and glorifying God for the fabric of our bodies and the
dignity of our nature.A sudden change from temperate warm weather to an
excessive cold rain, frost, snow, and storm, such as had seldom been
known.This winter weather began as early and fierce as the past did
late; till about Christmas there then had been hardly any winter.Turner, now translated from Rochester to Ely
upon the death of Dr.Peter Gunning, preached before the King at
Whitehall on Romans iii.8, a very excellent sermon, vindicating the
Church of England against the pernicious doctrines of the Church of
Rome.He challenged the producing but of five clergymen who forsook our
Church and went over to that of Rome, during all the troubles and
rebellion in England, which lasted near twenty years; and this was to my
certain observation a great truth.Being the Queen's birthday, there were fireworks
on the Thames before Whitehall, with pageants of castles, forts, and
other devices of girandolas, serpents, the King and Queen's arms and
mottoes, all represented in fire, such as had not been seen here.But
the most remarkable was the several fires and skirmishes in the very
water, which actually moved a long way, burning under the water, now and
then appearing above it, giving reports like muskets and cannon, with
grenades and innumerable other devices.It is said it cost L1,500.It
was concluded with a ball, where all the young ladies and gallants
danced in the great hall.The court had not been seen so brave and rich
in apparel since his Majesty's Restoration.Fiennes, son of the Lord Say
and Seale, preached before the King on Joshua xxi.Slingsby (Master of the
Mint), to see Mr.The series of Popes
was rare, and so were several among the moderns, especially that of John
Huss's martyrdom at Constance; of the Roman Emperors, Consulars some
Greek, etc., in copper, gold, and silver; not many truly antique; a
medallion of Otho Paulus Aemilius, etc., ancient.They were held at a
price of L1,000; but not worth, I judge, above L200.I went to see the new church at St.James's,
elegantly built; the altar was especially adorned, the white marble
inclosure curiously and richly carved, the flowers and garlands about
the walls by Mr.Gibbons, in wood: a pelican with her young at her
breast; just over the altar in the carved compartment and border
environing the purple velvet fringed with I. H. S. richly embroidered,
and most noble plate, were given by Sir R. Geere, to the value (as was
said) of L200.There was no altar anywhere in England, nor has there
been any abroad, more handsomely adorned.James's Park
to see three Turkish, or Asian horses, newly brought over, and now first
shown to his Majesty.There were four, but one of them died at sea,
being three weeks coming from Hamburg.They were taken from a Bashaw at
the siege of Vienna, at the late famous raising that leaguer.I never
beheld so delicate a creature as one of them was, of somewhat a bright
bay, two white feet, a blaze; such a head, eyes, ears, neck, breast,
belly, haunches, legs, pasterns, and feet, in all regards, beautiful,
and proportioned to admiration; spirited, proud, nimble, making halt,
turning with that swiftness, and in so small a compass, as was
admirable.With all this so gentle and tractable as called to mind what
I remember Busbequius, speaks of them, to the reproach of our grooms in
Europe, who bring up their horses so churlishly, as makes most of them
retain their ill habits.They trotted like does, as if they did not feel
the ground.Five hundred guineas was demanded for the first; 300 for the
second; and 200 for the third, which was brown.All of them were
choicely shaped, but the two last not altogether so perfect as the
first.It was judged by the spectators, among whom was the King, Prince of
Denmark, Duke of York, and several of the Court, noble persons skilled
in horses, especially Monsieur Faubert and his son (provost masters of
the Academy, and esteemed of the best in Europe), that there were never
seen any horses in these parts to be compared with them.Add to all
this, the furniture consisting of embroidery on the saddle, housings,
quiver, bow, arrows, scymitar, sword, mace, or battle-ax, _a la
Turcisq_; the Bashaw's velvet mantle furred with the most perfect ermine
I ever beheld; all which, ironwork in common furniture being here of
silver, curiously wrought and double gilt to an incredible value.Such
and so extraordinary was the embroidery, that I never saw anything
approaching it.The reins and headstall were of crimson silk, covered
with chains of silver gilt.There was also a Turkish royal standard of a
horse's tail, together with all sorts of other caparisons belonging to a
general's horse, by which one may estimate how gallantly and
magnificently those infidels appear in the field; for nothing could be
seen more glorious.The gentleman (a German) who rode the horse, was in
all this garb.They were shod with iron made round and closed at the
heel, with a hole in the middle about as wide as a shilling.I went with Lord Cornwallis to see the young
gallants do their exercise.Faubert having newly railed in a manage,
and fitted it for the academy.There were the Dukes of Norfolk and
Northumberland, Lord Newburgh, and a nephew of (Duras) Earl of
Feversham.The exercises were, 1, running at the ring; 2, flinging a
javelin at a Moor's head; 3, discharging a pistol at a mark; lastly
taking up a gauntlet with the point of a sword; all these performed in
full speed.The Duke of Northumberland hardly missed of succeeding in
every one, a dozen times, as I think.The Duke of Norfolk did exceeding
bravely.Lords Newburgh and Duras seemed nothing so dexterous.Here I
saw the difference of what the French call "_bel homme a cheval_," and
"_bon homme a cheval_"; the Duke of Norfolk being the first, that is
rather a fine person on a horse, the Duke of Northumberland being both
in perfection, namely, a graceful person and an excellent rider.But the
Duke of Norfolk told me he had not been at this exercise these twelve
years before.There were in the field the Prince of Denmark, and the
Lord Lansdowne, son of the Earl of Bath, who had been made a Count of
the Empire last summer for his service before Vienna.John, a worthy gentleman, on a knight
of quality, in a tavern.So
many horrid murders and duels were committed about this time as were
never before heard of in England; which gave much cause of complaint and
murmurings.It proved so sharp weather, and so long and cruel
a frost, that the Thames was frozen across, but the frost was often
dissolved, and then froze again.5, after
the Presbyterian tedious method and repetition.I dined at Lord Newport's, who had some excellent
pictures, especially that of Sir Thomas Hanmer, by Vandyke, one of the
best he ever painted; another of our English Dobson's painting; but,
above all, Christ in the Virgin's lap, by Poussin, an admirable piece;
with something of most other famous hands.I saw this
evening such a scene of profuse gaming, and the King in the midst of his
three concubines, as I have never before seen--luxurious dallying and
profaneness.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, being invited to hear
that celebrated voice of Mr.Pordage, newly come from Rome; his singing
was after the Venetian recitative, as masterly as could be, and with an
excellent voice both treble and bass; Dr.Walgrave accompanied it with
his THEORBO LUTE, on which he performed beyond imagination, and is
doubtless one of the greatest masters in Europe on that charming
instrument.Pordage is a priest, as Mr.There was in the room where we dined, and in his bedchamber, those
incomparable pieces of Columbus, a Flagellation, the Grammar school, the
Venus and Adonis of Titian; and of Vandyke's that picture of the late
Earl of Digby (father of the Countess of Sunderland), and Earl of
Bedford, Sir Kenelm Digby, and two ladies of incomparable performance;
besides that of Moses and the burning bush of Bassano, and several other
pieces of the best masters.A marble head of M. Brutus, etc.I was invited to my Lord Arundel's, of Wardour (now
newly released of his six years' confinement in the Tower on suspicion
of the plot called Oates's Plot), where after dinner the same Mr.Pordage entertained us with his voice, that excellent and stupendous
artist, Signor John Baptist, playing to it on the harpsichord.My
daughter Mary being with us, she also sang to the great satisfaction of
both the masters, and a world of people of quality present.She did so also at my Lord Rochester's the evening following, where we
had the French boy so famed for his singing, and indeed he had a
delicate voice, and had been well taught.Packer
(daughter to my old friend) sing before his Majesty and the Duke,
privately, that stupendous bass, Gosling, accompanying her, but hers was
so loud as took away much of the sweetness.Certainly never woman had a
stronger or better ear, could she possibly have governed it.She would
do rarely in a large church among the nuns.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th February, 1685.I went to London, hearing his Majesty had been the
Monday before (2d February) surprised in his bedchamber with an
apoplectic fit, so that if, by God's providence, Dr.King (that
excellent chirurgeon as well as physician) had not been accidentally
present to let him bleed (having his lancet in his pocket), his Majesty
had certainly died that moment; which might have been of direful
consequence, there being nobody else present with the King save this
Doctor and one more, as I am assured.It was a mark of the extraordinary
dexterity, resolution, and presence of mind in the Doctor, to let him
bleed in the very paroxysm, without staying the coming of other
physicians, which regularly should have been done, and for want of which
he must have a regular pardon, as they tell me.This rescued his Majesty
for the instant, but it was only a short reprieve.He still complained,
and was relapsing, often fainting, with sometimes epileptic symptoms,
till Wednesday, for which he was cupped, let bleed in both jugulars, and
both vomit and purges, which so relieved him, that on Thursday hopes of
recovery were signified in the public "Gazette," but that day about
noon, the physicians thought him feverish.This they seemed glad of, as
being more easily allayed and methodically dealt with than his former
fits; so as they prescribed the famous Jesuit's powder; but it made him
worse, and some very able doctors who were present did not think it a
fever, but the effect of his frequent bleeding and other sharp
operations used by them about his head, so that probably the powder
might stop the circulation, and renew his former fits, which now made
him very weak.Thus he passed Thursday night with great difficulty, when
complaining of a pain in his side, they drew twelve ounces more of blood
from him; this was by six in the morning on Friday, and it gave him
relief, but it did not continue, for being now in much pain, and
struggling for breath, he lay dozing, and, after some conflicts, the
physicians despairing of him, he gave up the ghost at half an hour after
eleven in the morning, being the sixth of February, 1685, in the 36th
year of his reign, and 54th of his age.Prayers were solemnly made in all the churches, especially in both the
Court Chapels, where the chaplains relieved one another every half
quarter of an hour from the time he began to be in danger till he
expired, according to the form prescribed in the Church offices.Those
who assisted his Majesty's devotions were, the Archbishop of Canterbury,
the Bishops of London, Durham, and Ely, but more especially Dr.Ken, the
Bishop of Bath and Wells.[55] It is said they exceedingly urged the
receiving Holy Sacrament, but his Majesty told them he would consider of
it, which he did so long till it was too late.Others whispered that the
Bishops and Lords, except the Earls of Bath and Feversham, being ordered
to withdraw the night before, Huddleston, the priest, had presumed to
administer the Popish offices.He gave his breeches and keys to the Duke
who was almost continually kneeling by his bedside, and in tears.He
also recommended to him the care of his natural children, all except the
Duke of Monmouth, now in Holland, and in his displeasure.He entreated
the Queen to pardon him (not without cause); who a little before had
sent a Bishop to excuse her not more frequently visiting him, in regard
of her excessive grief, and withal that his Majesty would forgive it if
at any time she had offended him.He spoke to the Duke to be kind to the
Duchess of Cleveland, and especially Portsmouth, and that Nelly might
not starve.[Footnote 55: The account given of this by Charles's brother and
    successor, is, that when the King's life was wholly despaired of,
    and it was time to prepare for another world, two Bishops came to do
    their function, who reading the prayers appointed in the Common
    Prayer Book on that occasion, when they came to the place where
    usually they exhort a sick person to make a confession of his sins,
    the Bishop of Bath and Wells, who was one of them, advertised him,
    IT WAS NOT OF OBLIGATION; and after a short exhortation, asked him
    if he was sorry for his sins?which the King saying he was, the
    Bishop pronounced the absolution, and then, asked him if he pleased
    to receive the Sacrament?to which the King made no reply; and being
    pressed by the Bishop several times, gave no other answer but that
    it was time enough, or that he would think of it.King James adds, that he stood all the while by the bedside, and
    seeing the King would not receive the Sacrament from them, and
    knowing his sentiments, he desired the company to stand a little
    from the bed, and then asked the King whether he should send for a
    priest, to which the King replied: "For God's sake, brother, do, and
    lose no time."The Duke said he would bring one to him; but none
    could be found except Father Huddleston, who had been so assistant
    in the King's escape from Worcester; he was brought up a back
    staircase, and the company were desired to withdraw, but he (the
    Duke of York) not thinking fit that he should be left alone with the
    King, desired the Earl of Bath, a Lord of the Bedchamber, and the
    Earl of Feversham, Captain of the Guard, should stay; the rest being
    gone, Father Huddleston was introduced, and administered the
    Sacrament.--"Life of James II."]Thus died King Charles II., of a vigorous and robust constitution, and
in all appearance promising a long life.He was a prince of many
virtues, and many great imperfections; debonair, easy of access, not
bloody nor cruel; his countenance fierce, his voice great, proper of
person, every motion became him; a lover of the sea, and skillful in
shipping; not affecting other studies, yet he had a laboratory, and knew
of many empirical medicines, and the easier mechanical mathematics; he
loved planting and building, and brought in a politer way of living,
which passed to luxury and intolerable expense.He had a particular
talent in telling a story, and facetious passages, of which he had
innumerable; this made some buffoons and vicious wretches too
presumptuous and familiar, not worthy the favor they abused.He took
delight in having a number of little spaniels follow him and lie in his
bedchamber, where he often suffered the bitches to puppy and give suck,
which rendered it very offensive, and indeed made the whole court nasty
and stinking.He would doubtless have been an excellent prince, had he
been less addicted to women, who made him uneasy, and always in want to
supply their immeasurable profusion, to the detriment of many indigent
persons who had signally served both him and his father.He frequently
and easily changed favorites to his great prejudice.As to other public transactions, and unhappy miscarriages, 'tis not
here I intend to number them; but certainly never had King more glorious
opportunities to have made himself, his people, and all Europe happy,
and prevented innumerable mischiefs, had not his too easy nature
resigned him to be managed by crafty men, and some abandoned and profane
wretches who corrupted his otherwise sufficient parts, disciplined as he
had been by many afflictions during his banishment, which gave him much
experience and knowledge of men and things; but those wicked creatures
took him from off all application becoming so great a King.The history
of his reign will certainly be the most wonderful for the variety of
matter and accidents, above any extant in former ages: the sad tragical
death of his father, his banishment and hardships, his miraculous
restoration, conspiracies against him, parliaments, wars, plagues,
fires, comets, revolutions abroad happening in his time, with a thousand
other particulars.He was ever kind to me, and very gracious upon all
occasions, and therefore I cannot without ingratitude but deplore his
loss, which for many respects, as well as duty, I do with all my soul.His Majesty being dead, the Duke, now King James II., went immediately
to Council, and before entering into any business, passionately
declaring his sorrow, told their Lordships, that since the succession
had fallen to him, he would endeavor to follow the example of his
predecessor in his clemency and tenderness to his people; that, however
he had been misrepresented as affecting arbitrary power, they should
find the contrary; for that the laws of England had made the King as
great a monarch as he could desire; that he would endeavor to maintain
the Government both in Church and State, as by law established, its
principles being so firm for monarchy, and the members of it showing
themselves so good and loyal subjects;[56] and that, as he would never
depart from the just rights and prerogatives of the Crown, so he would
never invade any man's property; but as he had often adventured his life
in defense of the nation, so he would still proceed, and preserve it in
all its lawful rights and liberties.[Footnote 56: This is the substance (and very nearly the words
    employed) of what is stated by King James II.printed in
    his life; but in that MS.For example, after speaking of the members of the Church of England
    as good and loyal subjects, the King adds, "AND THEREFORE I SHALL
    ALWAYS TAKE CARE TO DEFEND AND SUPPORT IT."James then goes on to
    say, that being desired by some present to allow copies to be taken,
    he said he had not committed it to writing; on which Mr.Finch (then
    Solicitor-General and afterward Earl of Aylesford) replied, that
    what his Majesty had said had made so deep an impression on him,
    that he believed he could repeat the very words, and if his Majesty
    would permit him, he would write them down, which the King agreeing
    to, he went to a table and wrote them down, and this being shown to
    the King, he approved of it, and it was immediately published.The
    King afterward proceeds to say: "No one can wonder that Mr.Finch
    should word the speech as strong as he could in favor of the
    Established Religion, nor that the King in such a hurry should pass
    it over without reflection; for though his Majesty intended to
    promise both security to their religion and protection to their
    persons, he was afterward convinced it had been better expressed by
    assuring them he never would endeavor to alter the Established
    Religion, than that he would endeavor to preserve it, and that he
    would rather support and defend the professors of it, than the
    religion itself; they could not expect he should make a conscience
    of supporting what in his conscience he thought erroneous: his
    engaging not to molest the professors of it, nor to deprive them or
    their successors of any spiritual dignity, revenue, or employment,
    but to suffer the ecclesiastical affairs to go on in the track they
    were in, was all they could wish or desire from a Prince of a
    different persuasion; but having once approved that way of
    expressing it which Mr.Finch had made choice of, he thought it
    necessary not to vary from it in the declarations or speeches he
    made afterward, not doubting but the world would understand it in
    the meaning he intended.----'Tis true, afterward IT WAS pretended
    he kept not up to this engagement; but had they deviated no further
    from the duty and allegience which both nature and repeated oath
    obliged them to, THAN HE DID FROM HIS WORD, they had still remained
    as happy a people as they really were during his short reign in
    England."The words printed in small
    caps in this extract are from the interlineations of the son of King
    James II.]This being the substance of what he said, the Lords desired it might be
published, as containing matter of great satisfaction to a jealous
people upon this change, which his Majesty consented to.Then were the
Council sworn, and a Proclamation ordered to be published that all
officers should continue in their stations, that there might be no
failure of public justice, till his further pleasure should be known.Then the King rose, the Lords accompanying him to his bedchamber, where,
while he reposed himself, tired indeed as he was with grief and
watching, they returned again into the Council chamber to take order for
the PROCLAIMING his Majesty, which (after some debate) they consented
should be in the very form his grandfather, King James I., was, after
the death of Queen Elizabeth; as likewise that the Lords, etc., should
proceed in their coaches through the city for the more solemnity of it.Upon this was I, and several other gentlemen waiting in the Privy
gallery, admitted into the Council chamber to be witness of what was
resolved on.Thence with the Lords, Lord Marshal and Heralds, and other
Crown officers being ready, we first went to Whitehall gate, where the
Lords stood on foot bareheaded, while the Herald proclaimed his
Majesty's title to the Imperial Crown and succession according to the
form, the trumpets and kettledrums having first sounded three times,
which ended with the people's acclamations.Then a herald called the
Lords' coaches according to rank, myself accompanying the solemnity in
my Lord Cornwallis's coach, first to Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor
and his brethren met us on horseback, in all their formalities, and
proclaimed the King; hence to the Exchange in Cornhill, and so we
returned in the order we set forth.Being come to Whitehall, we all went
and kissed the King and Queen's hands.He had been on the bed, but was
now risen and in his undress.The Queen was in bed in her apartment, but
put forth her hand, seeming to be much afflicted, as I believe she was,
having deported herself so decently upon all occasions since she came
into England, which made her universally beloved.I can never forget the inexpressible luxury and profaneness, gaming, and
all dissoluteness, and as it were total forgetfulness of God (it being
Sunday evening), which this day se'nnight I was witness of, the King
sitting and toying with his concubines, Portsmouth, Cleveland, and
Mazarin, etc., a French boy singing love songs[57] in that glorious
gallery, while about twenty of the great courtiers and other dissolute
persons were at Basset round a large table, a bank of at least 2,000 in
gold before them; upon which two gentlemen, who were with me, made
reflections with astonishment.Six days after, was all in the dust.[Footnote 57: _Ante_, p.It was enjoined that those who put on mourning should wear it as for a
father, in the most solemn manner.Being sent to by the Sheriff of the County to
appear and assist in proclaiming the King, I went the next day to
Bromley, where I met the Sheriff and the Commander of the Kentish Troop,
with an appearance, I suppose, of about 500 horse, and innumerable
people, two of his Majesty's trumpets, and a Sergeant with other
officers, who having drawn up the horse in a large field near the town,
marched thence, with swords drawn, to the market place, where, making a
ring, after sound of trumpets and silence made, the High Sheriff read
the proclaiming titles to his bailiff, who repeated them aloud, and
then, after many shouts of the people, his Majesty's health being drunk
in a flint glass of a yard long, by the Sheriff, Commander, Officers,
and chief gentlemen, they all dispersed, and I returned.I passed a fine on selling of Honson Grange in
Staffordshire, being about L20 per annum, which lying so great a
distance, I thought fit to part with it to one Burton, a farmer there.It came to me as part of my daughter-in-law's portion, this being but a
fourth part of what was divided between the mother and three sisters.The King was this night very obscurely buried in a
vault under Henry VII.'s Chapel at Westminster, without any manner of
pomp, and soon forgotten after all this vanity, and the face of the
whole Court was exceedingly changed into a more solemn and moral
behavior; the new King affecting neither profaneness nor buffoonery.All
the great officers broke their staves over the grave, according to form.The second
sermon should have been before the King; but he, to the great grief of
his subjects, did now, for the first time, go to mass publicly in the
little Oratory at the Duke's lodgings, the doors being set wide open.I dined at Sir Robert Howard's, auditor of the
exchequer, a gentleman pretending to all manner of arts and sciences,
for which he had been the subject of comedy, under the name of Sir
Positive; not ill-natured, but insufferably boasting.He was son to the
late Earl of Berkshire.This morning his Majesty restored the staff and key
to Lord Arlington, Chamberlain; to Mr.Savell, Vice-chamberlain; to
Lords Newport and Maynard, Treasurer and Comptroller of the household.Lord Godolphin made Chamberlain to the Queen; Lord Peterborough groom of
the stole, in place of the Earl of Bath; the Treasurer's staff to the
Earl of Rochester; and his brother, the Earl of Clarendon, Lord Privy
Seal, in the place of the Marquis of Halifax, who was made President of
the Council; the Secretaries of State remaining as before.The Lord Treasurer and the other new officers were
sworn at the Chancery Bar and the exchequer.The late King having the revenue of excise, customs, and other late
duties granted for his life only, they were now farmed and let to
several persons, upon an opinion that the late King might let them for
three years after his decease; some of the old commissioners refused to
act.The lease was made but the day before the King died;[58] the major
part of the Judges (but, as some think, not the best lawyers),
pronounced it legal, but four dissented.[Footnote 58: James, in his Life, makes no mention of this lease,
    but only says HE continued to collect them, which conduct was not
    blamed; but, on the contrary, he was thanked for it, in an address
    from the Middle Temple, penned by Sir Bartholomew Shore, and
    presented by Sir Humphrey Mackworth, carrying great authority with
    it; nor did the Parliament find fault.]The clerk of the closet had shut up the late King's private oratory next
the Privy-chamber above, but the King caused it to be opened again, and
that prayers should be said as formerly.Several most useful tracts against Dissenters,
<DW7>s and Fanatics, and resolutions of cases were now published by the
London divines.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th March, 1685.To my grief, I saw the new pulpit set up in the Popish
Oratory at Whitehall for the Lent preaching, mass being publicly said,
and the Romanists swarming at Court with greater confidence than had
ever been seen in England since the Reformation, so that everybody grew
jealous as to what this would tend.A Parliament was now summoned, and great industry used to obtain
elections which might promote the Court interest, most of the
corporations being now, by their new charters, empowered to make what
returns of members they pleased.There came over divers envoys and great persons to condole the death of
the late King, who were received by the Queen-Dowager on a bed of
mourning, the whole chamber, ceiling and floor, hung with black, and
tapers were lighted, so as nothing could be more lugubrious and solemn.The Queen-Consort sat under a state on a black foot-cloth, to entertain
the circle (as the Queen used to do), and that very decently.Lent preachers continued as formerly in the Royal
Chapel.My daughter, Mary, was taken with smallpox, and there
soon was found no hope of her recovery.A great affliction to me: but
God's holy will be done!She received the blessed sacrament; after which,
disposing herself to suffer what God should determine to inflict, she
bore the remainder of her sickness with extraordinary patience and
piety, and more than ordinary resignation and blessed frame of mind.She
died the 14th, to our unspeakable sorrow and affliction, and not to
our's only, but that of all who knew her, who were many of the best
quality, greatest and most virtuous persons.The justness of her
stature, person, comeliness of countenance, gracefulness of motion,
unaffected, though more than ordinarily beautiful, were the least of her
ornaments compared with those of her mind.Of early piety, singularly
religious, spending a part of every day in private devotion, reading,
and other virtuous exercises; she had collected and written out many of
the most useful and judicious periods of the books she read in a kind of
common-place, as out of Dr.Hammond on the New Testament, and most of
the best practical treatises.She had read and digested a considerable
deal of history, and of places.The French tongue was as familiar to her
as English; she understood Italian, and was able to render a laudable
account of what she read and observed, to which assisted a most faithful
memory and discernment; and she did make very prudent and discreet
reflections upon what she had observed of the conversations among which
she had at any time been, which being continually of persons of the best
quality, she thereby improved.She had an excellent voice, to which she
played a thorough-bass on the harpsichord, in both which she arrived to
that perfection, that of the scholars of those two famous masters,
Signors Pietro and Bartholomeo, she was esteemed the best; for the
sweetness of her voice and management of it added such an agreeableness
to her countenance, without any constraint or concern, that when she
sung, it was as charming to the eye as to the ear; this I rather note,
because it was a universal remark, and for which so many noble and
judicious persons in music desired to hear her, the last being at Lord
Arundel's, at Wardour.What shall I say, or rather not say, of the cheerfulness and
agreeableness of her humor?condescending to the meanest servant in the
family, or others, she still kept up respect, without the least pride.She would often read to them, examine, instruct, and pray with them if
they were sick, so as she was exceedingly beloved of everybody.Piety
was so prevalent an ingredient in her constitution (as I may say), that
even among equals and superiors she no sooner became intimately
acquainted, but she would endeavor to improve them, by insinuating
something religious, and that tended to bring them to a love of
devotion; she had one or two confidants with whom she used to pass whole
days in fasting, reading, and prayers, especially before the monthly
communion, and other solemn occasions.She abhorred flattery, and,
though she had abundance of wit, the raillery was so innocent and
ingenious that it was most agreeable; she sometimes would see a play,
but since the stage grew licentious, expressed herself weary of them,
and the time spent at the theater was an unaccountable vanity.She never
played at cards without extreme importunity and for the company; but
this was so very seldom, that I cannot number it among anything she
could name a fault.No one could read prose or verse better or with more judgment; and as
she read, so she wrote, not only most correct orthography, with that
maturity of judgment and exactness of the periods, choice of
expressions, and familiarity of style, that some letters of hers have
astonished me and others, to whom she has occasionally written.She had
a talent of rehearsing any comical part or poem, as to them she might be
decently free with; was more pleasing than heard on the theater; she
danced with the greatest grace I had ever seen, and so would her master
say, who was Monsieur Isaac; but she seldom showed that perfection, save
in the gracefulness of her carriage, which was with an air of sprightly
modesty not easily to be described.Nothing affected, but natural and
easy as well in her deportment as in her discourse, which was always
material, not trifling, and to which the extraordinary sweetness of her
tone, even in familiar speaking, was very charming.Nothing was so
pretty as her descending to play with little children, whom she would
caress and humor with great delight.But she most affected to be with
grave and sober men, of whom she might learn something, and improve
herself.I have been assisted by her in reading and praying by me;
comprehensive of uncommon notions, curious of knowing everything to some
excess, had I not sometimes repressed it.Nothing was so delightful to her as to go into my Study, where she would
willingly have spent whole days, for as I said she had read abundance of
history, and all the best poets, even Terence, Plautus, Homer, Virgil,
Horace, Ovid; all the best romancers and modern poems; she could compose
happily and put in pretty symbols, as in the "_Mundus Muliebris_,"
wherein is an enumeration of the immense variety of the modes and
ornaments belonging to the sex.But all these are vain trifles to the
virtues which adorned her soul; she was sincerely religious, most
dutiful to her parents, whom she loved with an affection tempered with
great esteem, so as we were easy and free, and never were so well
pleased as when she was with us, nor needed we other conversation; she
was kind to her sisters, and was still improving them by her constant
course of piety.Oh, dear, sweet, and desirable child, how shall I part
with all this goodness and virtue without the bitterness of sorrow and
reluctancy of a tender parent!Thy affection, duty and love to me was
that of a friend as well as a child.Nor less dear to thy mother, whose
example and tender care of thee was unparalleled, nor was thy return to
her less conspicuous.To the grave shall we both carry thy memory!God alone (in
whose bosom thou art at rest and happy!)give us to resign thee and all
our contentments (for thou indeed wert all in this world) to his blessed
pleasure!Let him be glorified by our submission, and give us grace to
bless him for the graces he implanted in thee, thy virtuous life, pious
and holy death, which is indeed the only comfort of our souls, hastening
through the infinite love and mercy of the Lord Jesus to be shortly with
thee, dear child, and with thee and those blessed saints like thee,
glorify the Redeemer of the world to all eternity!It was in the 19th year of her age that this sickness happened to her.An accident contributed to this disease; she had an apprehension of it
in particular, which struck her but two days before she came home, by an
imprudent gentlewoman whom she went with Lady Falkland to visit, who,
after they had been a good while in the house, told them she has a
servant sick of the smallpox (who indeed died the next day): this my
poor child acknowledged made an impression on her spirits.There were
four gentlemen of quality offering to treat with me about marriage, and
I freely gave her her own choice, knowing her discretion.She showed
great indifference to marrying at all, for truly, says she to her mother
(the other day), were I assured of your life and my dear father's, never
would I part from you; I love you and this home, where we serve God,
above all things, nor ever shall I be so happy; I know and consider the
vicissitudes of the world, I have some experience of its vanities, and
but for decency more than inclination, and that you judge it expedient
for me, I would not change my condition, but rather add the fortune you
design me to my sisters, and keep up the reputation of our family.This
was so discreetly and sincerely uttered that it could not but proceed
from an extraordinary child, and one who loved her parents beyond
example.At London, she took this fatal disease, and the occasion of her being
there was this: my Lord Viscount Falkland's Lady having been our
neighbor (as he was Treasurer of the Navy), she took so great an
affection to my daughter, that when they went back in the autumn to the
city, nothing would satisfy their incessant importunity but letting her
accompany my Lady, and staying some time with her; it was with the
greatest reluctance I complied.While she was there, my Lord being
musical, when I saw my Lady would not part with her till Christmas, I
was not unwilling she should improve the opportunity of learning of
Signor Pietro, who had an admirable way both of composure and teaching.It was the end of February before I could prevail with my Lady to part
with her; but my Lord going into Oxfordshire to stand for Knight of the
Shire there, she expressed her wish to come home, being tired of the
vain and empty conversation of the town, the theaters, the court, and
trifling visits which consumed so much precious time, and made her
sometimes miss of that regular course of piety that gave her the
greatest satisfaction.She was weary of this life, and I think went not
thrice to Court all this time, except when her mother or I carried her.She did not affect showing herself, she knew the Court well, and passed
one summer in it at Windsor with Lady Tuke, one of the Queen's women of
the bedchamber (a most virtuous relation of hers); she was not fond of
that glittering scene, now become abominably licentious, though there
was a design of Lady Rochester and Lady Clarendon to have made her a
maid of honor to the Queen as soon as there was a vacancy.But this she
did not set her heart upon, nor indeed on anything so much as the
service of God, a quiet and regular life, and how she might improve
herself in the most necessary accomplishments, and to which she was
arrived at so great a measure.This is the little history and imperfect character of my dear child,
whose piety, virtue, and incomparable endowments deserve a monument more
durable than brass and marble.Much I could enlarge on every period of this hasty account, but that I
ease and discharge my overcoming passion for the present, so many things
worthy an excellent Christian and dutiful child crowding upon me.Never
can I say enough, oh dear, my dear child, whose memory is so precious to
me!This dear child was born at Wotton, in the same house and chamber in
which I first drew my breath, my wife having retired to my brother there
in the great sickness that year upon the first of that month, and the
very hour that I was born, upon the last: viz, October.[Sidenote: SAYES COURT]

16th March, 1685.She was interred in the southeast end of the church at
Deptford, near her grandmother and several of my younger children and
relations.My desire was she should have been carried and laid among my
own parents and relations at Wotton, where I desire to be interred
myself, when God shall call me out of this uncertain transitory life,
but some circumstances did not permit it.Holden,
preached her funeral sermon on Phil."For to me to live is
Christ, and to die is gain," upon which he made an apposite discourse,
as those who heard it assured me (for grief suffered me not to be
present), concluding with a modest recital of her many virtues and
signal piety, so as to draw both tears and admiration from the hearers.I was not altogether unwilling that something of this sort should be
spoken, for the edification and encouragement of other young people.Divers noble persons honored her funeral, some in person, others
sending their coaches, of which there were six or seven with six horses,
viz, the Countess of Sunderland, Earl of Clarendon, Lord Godolphin, Sir
Stephen Fox, Sir William Godolphin, Viscount Falkland, and others.There
were distributed among her friends about sixty rings.Thus lived, died, and was buried the joy of my life, and ornament of her
sex and of my poor family!God Almighty of his infinite mercy grant me
the grace thankfully to resign myself and all I have, or had, to his
divine pleasure, and in his good time, restoring health and comfort to
my family: "teach me so to number my days, that I may apply my heart to
wisdom," be prepared for my dissolution, and that into the hands of my
blessed Savior I may recommend my spirit!On looking into her closet, it is incredible what a number of
collections she had made from historians, poets, travelers, etc., but,
above all, devotions, contemplations, and resolutions on these
contemplations, found under her hand in a book most methodically
disposed; prayers, meditations, and devotions on particular occasions,
with many pretty letters to her confidants; one to a divine (not named)
to whom she writes that he would be her ghostly father, and would not
despise her for her many errors and the imperfections of her youth, but
beg of God to give her courage to acquaint him with all her faults,
imploring his assistance and spiritual directions.I well remember she
had often desired me to recommend her to such a person; but I did not
think fit to do it as yet, seeing her apt to be scrupulous, and knowing
the great innocency and integrity of her life.It is astonishing how one who had acquired such substantial and
practical knowledge in other ornamental parts of education, especially
music, both vocal and instrumental, in dancing, paying and receiving
visits, and necessary conversation, could accomplish half of what she
has left; but, as she never affected play or cards, which consume a
world of precious time, so she was in continual exercise, which yet
abated nothing of her most agreeable conversation.But she was a little
miracle while she lived, and so she died!I was invited to the funeral of Captain Gunman, that
excellent pilot and seaman, who had behaved himself so gallantly in the
Dutch war.He died of a gangrene, occasioned by his fall from the pier
of Calais.This was the Captain of the yacht carrying the Duke (now
King) to Scotland, and was accused for not giving timely warning when
she split on the sands, where so many perished; but I am most confident
he was no ways guilty, either of negligence, or design, as he made
appear not only at the examination of the matter of fact, but in the
vindication he showed me, and which must needs give any man of reason
satisfaction.He was a sober, frugal, cheerful, and temperate man; we
have few such seamen left.Being now somewhat composed after my great affliction,
I went to London to hear Dr.Tenison (it being on a Wednesday in Lent)
at Whitehall.I observed that though the King was not in his seat above
in the chapel, the Doctor made his three congees, which they were not
used to do when the late King was absent, making then one bowing only.I
asked the reason; it was said he had a special order so to do.The
Princess of Denmark was in the King's closet, but sat on the left hand
of the chair, the Clerk of the Closet standing by his Majesty's chair,
as if he had been present.I met the Queen Dowager going now first from Whitehall to dwell at
Somerset House.This day my brother of Wotton and Mr.Onslow were candidates for Surrey
against Sir Adam Brown and my cousin, Sir Edward Evelyn, and were
circumvented in their election by a trick of the Sheriff's, taking
advantage of my brother's party going out of the small village of
Leatherhead to seek shelter and lodging, the afternoon being
tempestuous, proceeding to the election when they were gone; they
expecting the next morning; whereas before and then they exceeded the
other party by many hundreds, as I am assured.The Duke of Norfolk led
Sir Edward Evelyn's and Sir Adam Brown's party.For this Parliament,
very mean and slight persons (some of them gentlemen's servants, clerks,
and persons neither of reputation nor interest) were set up; but the
country would choose my brother whether he would or no, and he missed it
by the trick above mentioned.Sir Adam Brown was so deaf, that he could
not hear one word.Sir Edward Evelyn was an honest gentleman, much in
favor with his Majesty.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th April, 1685.I went early to Whitehall to hear Dr.Tillotson, Dean
of Canterbury, preaching on Eccles.I returned in the evening,
and visited Lady Tuke, and found with her Sir George Wakeman, the
physician, whom I had seen tried and acquitted, among the plotters for
poisoning the late King, on the accusation of the famous Oates; and
surely I believed him guiltless.According to my custom, I went to London to pass the
holy week.Tenison preached at the new church at
St.22, upon the infinite love of God to us, which
he illustrated in many instances.The Holy Sacrament followed, at which
I participated.Sprat,
Bishop of Rochester, preached in Whitehall chapel, the auditory very
full of Lords, the two Archbishops, and many others, now drawn to town
upon occasion of the coronation and ensuing Parliament.I supped with
the Countess of Sunderland and Lord Godolphin, and returned home.Was the coronation of the King and Queen.The solemnity
was magnificent as is set forth in print.The Bishop of Ely preached;
but, to the sorrow of the people, no Sacrament, as ought to have been.However, the King begins his reign with great expectations, and hopes of
much reformation as to the late vices and profaneness of both Court and
country.Having been present at the late King's coronation, I was not
ambitious of seeing this ceremony.A young man preached, going chaplain with Sir J. Wiburn,
Governor of Bombay, in the East Indies.I was in Westminster Hall when Oates, who had made such
a stir in the kingdom, on his revealing a plot of the <DW7>s, and
alarmed several Parliaments, and had occasioned the execution of divers
priests, noblemen, etc., was tried for perjury at the King's bench; but,
being very tedious, I did not endeavor to see the issue, considering
that it would be published.Abundance of Roman Catholics were in the
hall in expectation of the most grateful conviction and ruin of a person
who had been so obnoxious to them, and as I verily believe, had done
much mischief and great injury to several by his violent and
ill-grounded proceedings; while he was at first so unreasonably blown up
and encouraged, that his insolence was no longer sufferable.Roger L'Estrange (a gentleman whom I had long known, and a person of
excellent parts, abating some affectations) appearing first against the
Dissenters in several tracts, had now for some years turned his style
against those whom (by way of hateful distinction) they called Whigs and
Trimmers, under the title of "Observator," which came out three or four
days every week, in which sheets, under pretense to serve the Church of
England, he gave suspicion of gratifying another party, by several
passages which rather kept up animosities than appeased them, especially
now that nobody gave the least occasion.[59]

    [Footnote 59: In the first Dutch war, while Evelyn was one of the
    Commissioners for sick and wounded, L'Estrange in his "Gazette"
    mentioned the barbarous usage of the Dutch prisoners of war:
    whereupon Evelyn wrote him a very spirited letter, desiring that the
    Dutch Ambassador (who was then in England) and his friends would
    visit the prisoners, and examine their provisions; and he required
    L'Estrange to publish that vindication in his next number.]The Scots valuing themselves exceedingly to have been
the first Parliament called by his Majesty, gave the excise and customs
to him and his successors forever; the Duke of Queensberry making
eloquent speeches, and especially minding them of a speedy suppression
of those late desperate Field-Conventiclers who had done such unheard of
assassinations.In the meantime, elections for the ensuing Parliament in
England were thought to be very indirectly carried on in most places.God grant a better issue of it than some expect!Oates was sentenced to be whipped and pilloried with the
utmost severity.I dined at my Lord Privy Seal's with Sir William
Dugdale, Garter King-at-Arms, author of the "MONASTICON" and other
learned works; he told me he was 82 years of age, and had his sight and
memory perfect.There was shown a draft of the exact shape and
dimensions of the crown the Queen had been crowned withal, together with
the jewels and pearls, their weight and value, which amounted to
L100,658 sterling, attested at the foot of the paper by the jeweler and
goldsmith who set them.In the morning, I went with a French gentleman, and my
Lord Privy Seal to the House of Lords, where we were placed by his
Lordship next the bar, just below the bishops, very commodiously both
for hearing and seeing.After a short space, came in the Queen and
Princess of Denmark, and stood next above the archbishops, at the side
of the House on the right hand of the throne.In the interim, divers of
the Lords, who had not finished before, took the test and usual oaths,
so that her Majesty, the Spanish and other Ambassadors, who stood behind
the throne, heard the Pope and the worship of the Virgin Mary, etc.,
renounced very decently, as likewise the prayers which followed,
standing all the while.Then came in the King, the crown on his head,
and being seated, the Commons were introduced, and the House being full,
he drew forth a paper containing his speech, which he read distinctly
enough, to this effect: "That he resolved to call a Parliament from the
moment of his brother's decease, as the best means to settle all the
concerns of the nation, so as to be most easy and happy to himself and
his subjects; that he would confirm whatever he had said in his
declaration at the first Council concerning his opinion of the
principles of the Church of England, for their loyalty, and would defend
and support it, and preserve its government as by law now established;
that, as he would invade no man's property, so he would never depart
from his own prerogative; and, as he had ventured his life in defense of
the nation, so he would proceed to do still; that, having given this
assurance of his care of our religion (his word was YOUR religion) and
property (which he had not said by chance, but solemnly), so he doubted
not of suitable returns of his subjects' duty and kindness, especially
as to settling his revenue for life, for the many weighty necessities of
government, which he would not suffer to be precarious; that some might
possibly suggest that it were better to feed and supply him from time to
time only, out of their inclination to frequent Parliaments; but that
that would be a very improper method to take with him, since the best
way to engage him to meet oftener would be always to use him well, and
therefore he expected their compliance speedily, that this session being
but short, they might meet again to satisfaction."At every period of this, the House gave loud shouts.Then he acquainted
them with that morning's news of Argyle's being landed in the West
Highlands of Scotland from Holland, and the treasonous declaration he
had published, which he would communicate to them, and that he should
take the best care he could it should meet with the reward it deserved,
not questioning the Parliament's zeal and readiness to assist him as he
desired; at which there followed another "_Vive le Roi_," and so his
Majesty retired.So soon as the Commons were returned and had put themselves into a grand
committee, they immediately put the question, and unanimously voted the
revenue to his Majesty for life.Seymour made a bold speech against
many elections, and would have had those members who (he pretended) were
obnoxious, to withdraw, till they had cleared the matter of their being
legally returned; but no one seconded him.The truth is, there were many
of the new members whose elections and returns were universally
censured, many of them being persons of no condition, or interest, in
the nation, or places for which they served, especially in Devon,
Cornwall, Norfolk, etc., said to have been recommended by the Court, and
from the effect of the new charters changing the electors.It was
reported that Lord Bath carried down with him [into Cornwall] no fewer
than fifteen charters, so that some called him the Prince Elector:
whence Seymour told the House in his speech that if this was digested,
they might introduce what religion and laws they pleased, and that
though he never gave heed to the fears and jealousies of the people
before, he was now really apprehensive of Popery.By the printed list of
members of 505, there did not appear to be above 135 who had been in
former Parliaments, especially that lately held at Oxford.In the Lords' House, Lord Newport made an exception against two or three
young Peers, who wanted some months, and some only four or five days, of
being of age.The Popish Lords, who had been sometime before released from their
confinement about the plot, were now discharged of their impeachment, of
which I gave Lord Arundel of Wardour joy.Oates, who had but two days before been pilloried at several places and
whipped at the cart's tail from Newgate to Aldgate, was this day placed
on a sledge, being not able to go by reason of so late scourging, and
dragged from prison to Tyburn, and whipped again all the way, which some
thought to be severe and extraordinary; but, if he was guilty of the
perjuries, and so of the death of many innocents (as I fear he was), his
punishment was but what he deserved.I chanced to pass just as execution
was doing on him.Note: there was no speech made by the Lord Keeper [Bridgman] after his
Majesty, as usual.It was whispered he would not be long in that situation, and many
believe the bold Chief Justice Jefferies, who was made Baron of Wem, in
Shropshire, and who went thorough stitch in that tribunal, stands fair
for that office.I gave him joy the morning before of his new honor, he
having always been very civil to me.We had hitherto not any rain for many months, so as the
caterpillars had already devoured all the winter fruit through the whole
land, and even killed several greater old trees.Such two winters and
summers I had never known.Came to visit and take leave of me Sir Gabriel Sylvius,
now going Envoy-extraordinary into Denmark, with his secretary and
chaplain, a Frenchman, who related the miserable persecution of the
Protestants in France; not above ten churches left them, and those also
threatened to be demolished; they were commanded to christen their
children within twenty-four hours after birth, or else a Popish priest
was to be called, and then the infant brought up in Popery.In some
places, they were thirty leagues from any minister, or opportunity of
worship.This persecution had displeased the most industrious part of
the nation, and dispersed those into Switzerland, Burgundy, Holland,
Germany, Denmark, England, and the Plantations.There were with Sir
Gabriel, his lady, Sir William Godolphin and sisters, and my Lord
Godolphin's little son, my charge.I brought them to the water side
where Sir Gabriel embarked, and the rest returned to London.There was now certain intelligence of the Duke of
Monmouth landing at Lyme, in Dorsetshire, and of his having set up his
standard as King of England.I pray God deliver us from the confusion
which these beginnings threaten!Such a dearth for want of rain was never in my memory.The Duke landed with but 150 men; but the whole kingdom
was alarmed, fearing that the disaffected would join them, many of the
trained bands flocking to him.At his landing, he published a
Declaration, charging his Majesty with usurpation and several horrid
crimes, on pretense of his own title, and offering to call a free
Parliament.This declaration was ordered to be burnt by the hangman, the
Duke proclaimed a traitor, and a reward of L5,000 to any who should kill
him.At this time, the words engraved on the monument in London, intimating
that the <DW7>s fired the city, were erased and cut out.I received a warrant to send out a horse with twelve
days' provisions, etc.We had now plentiful rain after two years' excessive
drought and severe winters.Argyle taken in Scotland, and executed, and his party dispersed.No considerable account of the troops sent against the
Duke, though great forces sent.There was a smart skirmish; but he would
not be provoked to come to an encounter, but still kept in the
fastnesses.Dangerfield whipped, like Oates, for perjury.Came news of Monmouth's utter defeat, and the next day
of his being taken by Sir William Portman and Lord Lumley with the
militia of their counties.It seems the Horse, commanded by Lord Grey,
being newly raised and undisciplined, were not to be brought in so short
a time to endure the fire, which exposed the Foot to the King's, so as
when Monmouth had led the Foot in great silence and order, thinking to
surprise Lieutenant-General Lord Feversham newly encamped, and given him
a smart charge, interchanging both great and small shot, the Horse,
breaking their own ranks, Monmouth gave it over, and fled with Grey,
leaving their party to be cut in pieces to the number of 2,000.The
whole number reported to be above 8,000; the King's but 2,700.The slain
were most of them MENDIP-MINERS, who did great execution with their
tools, and sold their lives very dearly, while their leaders flying were
pursued and taken the next morning, not far from one another.Monmouth
had gone sixteen miles on foot, changing his habit for a poor coat, and
was found by Lord Lumley in a dry ditch covered with fern-brakes, but
without sword, pistol, or any weapon, and so might have passed for some
countryman, his beard being grown so long and so gray as hardly to be
known, had not his George discovered him, which was found in his pocket.It is said he trembled exceedingly all over, not able to speak.Grey was
taken not far from him.Most of his party were Anabaptists and poor
cloth workers of the country, no gentlemen of account being come in to
him.The arch-_boutefeu_, Ferguson, Matthews, etc., were not yet found.The L5,000 to be given to whoever should bring Monmouth in, was to be
distributed among the militia by agreement between Sir William Portman
and Lord Lumley.The battle ended, some words, first in jest, then in
passion, passed between Sherrington Talbot (a worthy gentleman, son to
Sir John Talbot, and who had behaved himself very handsomely) and one
Captain Love, both commanders of the militia, as to whose soldiers
fought best, both drawing their swords and passing at one another.Sherrington was wounded to death on the spot, to the great regret of
those who knew him.[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th July, 1685.Just as I was coming into the lodgings at Whitehall, a
little before dinner, my Lord of Devonshire standing very near his
Majesty's bedchamber door in the lobby, came Colonel Culpeper, and in a
rude manner looking at my Lord in the face, asked whether this was a
time and place for excluders to appear; my Lord at first took little
notice of what he said, knowing him to be a hotheaded fellow, but he
reiterating it, my Lord asked Culpeper whether he meant him; he said
yes, he meant his Lordship.My Lord told him he was no excluder (as
indeed he was not); the other affirming it again, my Lord told him he
lied; on which Culpeper struck him a box on the ear, which my Lord
returned, and felled him.They were soon parted, Culpeper was seized,
and his Majesty, who was all the while in his bedchamber, ordered him to
be carried to the Greencloth officer, who sent him to the Marshalsea, as
he deserved.I supped this night at Lambeth at my old friend's Mr.Elias Ashmole's,
with my Lady Clarendon, the Bishop of St.Tenison, when
we were treated at a great feast.The Count of Castel Mellor, that great favorite and
prime minister of Alphonso, late King of Portugal, after several years'
banishment, being now received to grace and called home by Don Pedro,
the present King, as having been found a person of the greatest
integrity after all his sufferings, desired me to spend part of this day
with him, and assist him in a collection of books and other curiosities,
which he would carry with him into Portugal.Hussey, a young gentleman who made love to my late dear child, but
whom she could not bring herself to answer in affection, died now of the
same cruel disease, for which I was extremely sorry, because he never
enjoyed himself after my daughter's decease, nor was I averse to the
match, could she have overcome her disinclination.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th July, 1685.Monmouth was this day brought to London and examined before the King,
to whom he made great submission, acknowledged his seduction by
Ferguson, the Scot, whom he named the bloody villain.He was sent to the
Tower, had an interview with his late Duchess, whom he received coldly,
having lived dishonestly with the Lady Henrietta Wentworth for two
years.He obstinately asserted his conversation with that debauched
woman to be no sin; whereupon, seeing he could not be persuaded to his
last breath, the divines who were sent to assist him thought not fit to
administer the Holy Communion to him.For the rest of his faults he
professed great sorrow, and so died without any apparent fear.He would
not make use of a cap or other circumstance, but lying down, bid the
fellow to do his office better than to the late Lord Russell, and gave
him gold; but the wretch made five chops before he had his head off;
which so incensed the people, that had he not been guarded and got away,
they would have torn him to pieces.The Duke made no speech on the scaffold (which was on Tower Hill), but
gave a paper containing not above five or six lines, for the King, in
which he disclaims all title to the Crown, acknowledges that the late
King, his father, had indeed told him he was but his base son, and so
desired his Majesty to be kind to his wife and children.Martin's), who, with the Bishops of
Ely and Bath and Wells, were sent to him by his Majesty, and were at the
execution.Thus ended this quondam Duke, darling of his father and the ladies,
being extremely handsome and adroit, an excellent soldier and dancer, a
favorite of the people, of an easy nature, debauched by lust; seduced by
crafty knaves, who would have set him up only to make a property, and
taken the opportunity of the King being of another religion, to gather a
party of discontented men.He was a lovely person, had a virtuous and excellent lady that brought
him great riches, and a second dukedom in Scotland.He was Master of the
Horse, General of the King his father's army, Gentleman of the
Bedchamber, Knight of the Garter, Chancellor of Cambridge, in a word,
had accumulations without end.See what ambition and want of principles
brought him to!He was beheaded on Tuesday, 14th of July.His mother,
whose name was Barlow, daughter of some very mean creatures, was a
beautiful strumpet, whom I had often seen at Paris; she died miserably
without anything to bury her; yet this Perkin had been made to believe
that the King had married her, a monstrous and ridiculous forgery!And
to satisfy the world of the iniquity of the report, the King his father
(if his father he really was, for he most resembled one Sidney who was
familiar with his mother) publicly and most solemnly renounced it, to be
so entered in the Council Book some years since, with all the Privy
Councillors' attestation.[60]

    [Footnote 60: The "Life of James II."contains an account of the
    circumstances of the Duke of Monmouth's birth, which may be given in
    illustration of the statements of the text.Ross, tutor to the Duke
    of Monmouth, is there said to have proposed to Bishop Cosins to sign
    a certificate of the King's marriage to Mrs.Barlow, though her own
    name was Walters: but this the Bishop refused.She was born of a
    gentleman's family in Wales, but having little means and less grace,
    came to London to make her fortune.Algernon Sydney, then a Colonel
    in Cromwell's army, had agreed to give her fifty broad pieces (as he
    told the Duke of York); but being ordered hastily away with his
    regiment, he missed his bargain.She went into Holland, where she
    fell into the hands of his brother, Colonel Robert Sydney, who kept
    her for some time, till the King hearing of her, got her from him.On which the Colonel was heard to say, Let who will have her, she is
    already sped; and, after being with the King, she was so soon with
    child, that the world had no cause to doubt whose child it was, and
    the rather that when he grew to be a man, he very much resembled the
    Colonel both in stature and countenance, even to a wart on his face.In the King's absence she behaved
    so loosely, that on his return from his escape at Worcester he would
    have no further commerce with her, and she became a common
    prostitute at Paris.]Had it not pleased God to dissipate this attempt in the beginning, there
would in all appearance have gathered an irresistible force which would
have desperately proceeded to the ruin of the Church and Government; so
general was the discontent and expectation of the opportunity.For my
own part, I looked upon this deliverance as most signal.Such an
inundation of fanatics and men of impious principles must needs have
caused universal disorder, cruelty, injustice, rapine, sacrilege, and
confusion, an unavoidable civil war, and misery without end.Blessed be
God, the knot was happily broken, and a fair prospect of tranquillity
for the future, if we reform, be thankful, and make a right use of this
mercy!I went to see the muster of the six Scotch and English
regiments whom the Prince of Orange had lately sent to his Majesty out
of Holland upon this rebellion, but which were now returning, there
having been no occasion for their use.They were all excellently clad
and well disciplined, and were encamped on Blackheath with their tents:
the King and Queen came to see them exercise, and the manner of their
encampment, which was very neat and magnificent.By a gross mistake of the Secretary of his Majesty's Forces, it had
been ordered that they should be quartered in private houses, contrary
to an Act of Parliament, but, on my informing his Majesty timely of it,
it was prevented.The two horsemen which my son and myself sent into the county troops,
were now come home, after a month's being out to our great charge.The Trinity Company met this day, which should have
been on the Monday after Trinity, but was put off by reason of the Royal
Charter being so large, that it could not be ready before.Pepys, Secretary to the Admiralty, was a
second time chosen Master.There were present the Duke of Grafton, Lord
Dartmouth, Master of the Ordnance, the Commissioners of the Navy, and
Brethren of the Corporation.We went to church, according to custom, and
then took barge to the Trinity House, in London, where we had a great
dinner, above eighty at one table.[Sidenote: CHELSEA]

7th August, 1685.Watts, keeper of the Apothecaries'
garden of simples at Chelsea, where there is a collection of innumerable
rarities of that sort particularly, besides many rare annuals, the tree
bearing Jesuit's bark, which had done such wonders in quartan agues.What was very ingenious was the subterranean heat, conveyed by a stove
under the conservatory, all vaulted with brick, so as he has the doors
and windows open in the hardest frosts, secluding only the snow.Boscawen, with my Lord
Godolphin's little son, with whose education hitherto his father had
intrusted me.My daughter Elizabeth died of the smallpox, soon
after having married a young man, nephew of Sir John Tippett, Surveyor
of the Navy, and one of the Commissioners.The 30th, she was buried in
the church at Deptford.Thus, in less than six months were we deprived
of two children for our unworthiness and causes best known to God, whom
I beseech from the bottom of my heart that he will give us grace to make
that right use of all these chastisements, that we may become better,
and entirely submit in all things to his infinitely wise disposal.Lord Clarendon (Lord Privy Seal) wrote to let me
know that the King being pleased to send him Lord-Lieutenant into
Ireland, was also pleased to nominate me one of the Commissioners to
execute the office of Privy Seal during his Lieutenancy there, it
behoving me to wait upon his Majesty to give him thanks for this great
honor.I accompanied his Lordship to Windsor (dining by
the way of Sir Henry Capel's at Kew), where his Majesty receiving me
with extraordinary kindness, I kissed his hand, I told him how sensible
I was of his Majesty's gracious favor to me, that I would endeavor to
serve him with all sincerity, diligence, and loyalty, not more out of my
duty than inclination.He said he doubted not of it, and was glad he had
the opportunity to show me the kindness he had for me.After this, came
abundance of great men to give me joy.I went to prayer in the chapel, and heard
Dr.11, persuading to unity and peace, and to be mindful of our
own business, according to the advice of the apostle.Then I went to
hear a Frenchman who preached before the King and Queen in that splendid
chapel next St.Their Majesties going to mass, I withdrew
to consider the stupendous painting of the Hall, which, both for the art
and invention, deserve the inscription in honor of the painter, Signor
Verrio.receiving the Black Prince, coming
toward him in a Roman triumph.The throne, the carvings, etc., are incomparable, and I think
equal to any, and in many circumstances exceeding any, I have seen
abroad.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, with (among others) Sir William Soames,
designed Ambassador to Constantinople.About 6 o'clock came Sir Dudley and his brother Roger North, and
brought the Great Seal from my Lord Keeper, who died the day before at
his house in Oxfordshire.The King went immediately to council;
everybody guessing who was most likely to succeed this great officer;
most believing it could be no other than my Lord Chief Justice
Jefferies, who had so vigorously prosecuted the late rebels, and was now
gone the Western Circuit, to punish the rest that were secured in
several counties, and was now near upon his return.I took my leave of
his Majesty, who spoke very graciously to me, and supping that night at
Sir Stephen Fox's, I promised to dine there the next day.Pepys to Portsmouth, whither his
Majesty was going the first time since his coming to the Crown, to see
in what state the fortifications were.We took coach and six horses,
late after dinner, yet got to Bagshot that night.While supper was
making ready I went and made a visit to Mrs.Graham, some time maid of
honor to the Queen Dowager, now wife to James Graham, Esq., of the privy
purse to the King; her house being a walk in the forest, within a little
quarter of a mile from Bagshot town.Very importunate she was that I
would sup, and abide there that night; but, being obliged by my
companion, I returned to our inn, after she had shown me her house,
which was very commodious, and well furnished, as she was an excellent
housewife, a prudent and virtuous lady.There is a park full of red deer
about it.Her eldest son was now sick there of the smallpox, but in a
likely way of recovery, and other of her children run about, and among
the infected, which she said she let them do on purpose that they might
while young pass that fatal disease she fancied they were to undergo one
time or other, and that this would be the best: the severity of this
cruel distemper so lately in my poor family confirming much of what she
affirmed.[Sidenote: WINCHESTER]

16th September, 1685.The next morning, setting out early, we arrived
soon enough at Winchester to wait on the King, who was lodged at the
Dean's (Dr.I found very few with him besides my Lords
Feversham, Arran, Newport, and the Bishop of Bath and Wells.His Majesty
was discoursing with the bishops concerning miracles, and what strange
things the Saludadors[61] would do in Spain, as by creeping into heated
ovens without hurt, and that they had a black cross in the roof of their
mouths, but yet were commonly notorious and profane wretches; upon which
his Majesty further said, that he was so extremely difficult of
miracles, for fear of being imposed upon, that if he should chance to
see one himself, without some other witness, he should apprehend it a
delusion of his senses.Then they spoke of the boy who was pretended to
have a wanting leg restored him, so confidently asserted by Fr.To all of which the Bishop added a great miracle
happening in Winchester to his certain knowledge, of a poor, miserably
sick and decrepit child (as I remember long kept unbaptized) who
immediately on his baptism, recovered; as also of the salutary effect of
King Charles his Majesty's father's blood, in healing one that was
blind.[Footnote 61: Evelyn subjoins this note:--"As to that of the
    Saludador (of which likewise I remember Sir Arthur Hopton, formerly
    as Ambassador at Madrid, had told me many like wonders), Mr.Pepys
    passing through Spain, and being extremely inquisitive of the truth
    of these pretended miracles of the Saludadors, found a very famous
    one at last, to whom he offered a considerable reward if he would
    make a trial of the oven, or any other thing of that kind, before
    him; the fellow ingenuously told him, that finding he was a more
    than ordinary curious person, he would not deceive him, and so
    acknowledged that he could do none of the feats really, but that
    what they pretended was all a cheat, which he would easily discover,
    though the poor superstitious people were easily imposed upon; yet
    have these impostors an allowance of the Bishops to practice their
    jugglings.Pepys affirmed to me; but said he, I did not
    conceive it fit to interrupt his Majesty, who so solemnly told what
    they pretended to do.There was something said of the second sight happening to some persons,
especially Scotch; upon which his Majesty, and I think Lord Arran, told
us that Monsieur... a French nobleman, lately here in England, seeing
the late Duke of Monmouth come into the playhouse at London, suddenly
cried out to somebody sitting in the same box, "_Voila Monsieur comme il
entre sans tete!_" Afterward his Majesty spoke of some relics that had
effected strange cures, particularly a piece of our blessed Savior's
cross, that healed a gentleman's rotten nose by only touching.And
speaking of the golden cross and chain taken out of the coffin of St.Edward the Confessor at Westminster, by one of the singing-men, who, as
the scaffolds were taken down after his Majesty's coronation, espying a
hole in the tomb, and something glisten, put his hand in, and brought it
to the dean, and he to the King; his Majesty began to put the Bishop in
mind how earnestly the late King (his brother) called upon him during
his agony, to take out what he had in his pocket."I had thought," said
the King, "it had been for some keys, which might lead to some cabinet
that his Majesty would have me secure"; but, says he, "you will remember
that I found nothing in any of his pockets but a cross of gold, and a
few insignificant papers"; and thereupon he showed us the cross, and was
pleased to put it into my hand.It was of gold, about three inches long,
having on one side a crucifix enameled and embossed, the rest was graved
and garnished with goldsmiths' work, and two pretty broad table
amethysts (as I conceived), and at the bottom a pendant pearl; within
was enchased a little fragment, as was thought, of the true cross, and a
Latin inscription in gold and Roman letters.More company coming in,
this discourse ended.I may not forget a resolution which his Majesty
made, and had a little before entered upon it at the Council Board at
Windsor or Whitehall, that the <DW64>s in the plantations should all be
baptized, exceedingly declaiming against that impiety of their masters
prohibiting it, out of a mistaken opinion that they would be _ipso
facto_ free; but his Majesty persists in his resolution to have them
christened, which piety the Bishop blessed him for.I went out to see the new palace the late King had begun, and brought
almost to the covering.It is placed on the side of the hill, where
formerly stood the old castle.It is a stately fabric, of three sides
and a corridor, all built of brick, and cornished, windows and columns
at the break and entrance of free-stone.It was intended for a
hunting-house when his Majesty should come to these parts, and has an
incomparable prospect.I believe there had already been L20,000 and more
expended; but his now Majesty did not seem to encourage the finishing it
at least for a while.Hence to see the Cathedral, a reverend pile, and in good repair.There
are still the coffins of the six Saxon Kings, whose bones had been
scattered by the sacrilegious rebels of 1641, in expectation, I suppose,
of finding some valuable relics, and afterward gathered up again and put
into new chests, which stand above the stalls of the choir.[Sidenote: PORTSMOUTH]

17th September, 1685.Early next morning, we went to Portsmouth,
something before his Majesty arrived.We found all the road full of
people, the women in their best dress, in expectation of seeing the King
pass by, which he did, riding on horseback a good part of the way.The
Mayor and Aldermen with their mace, and in their formalities, were
standing at the entrance of the fort, a mile on this side of the town,
where the Mayor made a speech to the King, and then the guns of the fort
were fired, as were those of the garrison, as soon as the King was come
into Portsmouth.All the soldiers (near 3,000) were drawn up, and lining
the streets and platform to God's House (the name of the Governor's
residence), where, after he had viewed the new fortifications and
shipyard, his Majesty was entertained at a magnificent dinner by Sir...
Slingsby, the Lieutenant Governor, all the gentlemen in his train
sitting down at table with him, which I also had done, had I not been
before engaged to Sir Robert Holmes, Governor of the Isle of Wight, to
dine with him at a private house, where likewise we had a very sumptuous
and plentiful repast of excellent venison, fowl, fish, and fruit.After dinner, I went to wait on his Majesty again, who was pulling on
his boots in the Town Hall adjoining the house where he dined, and then
having saluted some ladies, who came to kiss his hand, he took horse for
Winchester, whither he returned that night.This hall is artificially
hung round with arms of all sorts, like the hall and keep at Windsor.Hence, to see the shipyard and dock, the fortifications, and other
things.Portsmouth, when finished, will be very strong, and a noble quay.There
were now thirty-two men-of-war in the harbor.I was invited by Sir R.
Beach, the Commissioner, where, after a great supper, Mr.Secretary and
myself lay that night, and the next morning set out for Guildford, where
we arrived in good hour, and so the day after to London.I had twice before been at Portsmouth, the Isle of Wight, etc., many
years since.I found this part of Hampshire bravely wooded, especially
about the house and estate of Colonel Norton, who though now in being,
having formerly made his peace by means of Colonel Legg, was formerly a
very fierce commander in the first Rebellion.His house is large, and
standing low, on the road from Winchester to Portsmouth.By what I observed in this journey, is that infinite industry,
sedulity, gravity, and great understanding and experience of affairs, in
his Majesty, that I cannot but predict much happiness to the nation, as
to its political government; and, if he so persist, there could be
nothing more desired to accomplish our prosperity, but that he was of
the national religion.Lord Clarendon's commission for Lieutenant of
Ireland was sealed this day.[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d October, 1685.Pepys with this
expression at the foot of it, "I have something to show you that I may
not have another time," and that I would not fail to dine with him.Houblon (a rich and
considerable merchant, whose father had fled out of Flanders on the
persecution of the Duke of Alva) into a private room, and told us that
being lately alone with his Majesty, and upon some occasion of speaking
concerning my late Lord Arlington dying a Roman Catholic, who had all
along seemed to profess himself a Protestant, taken all the tests, etc.,
till the day (I think) of his death, his Majesty said that as to his
inclinations he had known them long wavering, but from fear of losing
his places, he did not think it convenient to declare himself.There
are, says the King, those who believe the Church of Rome gives
dispensations for going to church, and many like things, but that is not
so; for if that might have been had, he himself had most reason to make
use of it.INDEED, he said, as to SOME MATRIMONIAL CASES, THERE ARE NOW
AND THEN DISPENSATIONS, but hardly in any cases else.Pepys to beg of his Majesty, if
he might ask it without offense, and for that his Majesty could not but
observe how it was whispered among many whether his late Majesty had
been reconciled to the Church of Rome; he again humbly besought his
Majesty to pardon his presumption, if he had touched upon a thing which
did not befit him to look into.The King ingenuously told him that he
both was and died a Roman Catholic, and that he had not long since
declared that it was upon some politic and state reasons, best known to
himself (meaning the King his brother), but that he was of that
persuasion: he bid him follow him into his closet, where opening a
cabinet, he showed him two papers, containing about a quarter of a
sheet, on both sides written, in the late King's own hand, several
arguments opposite to the doctrine of the Church of England, charging
her with heresy, novelty, and the fanaticism of other Protestants, the
chief whereof was, as I remember, our refusing to acknowledge the
primacy and infallibility of the Church of Rome; how impossible it was
that so many ages should never dispute it, till of late; how unlikely
our Savior would leave his Church without a visible Head and guide to
resort to, during his absence; with the like usual topic; so well penned
as to the discourse as did by no means seem to me to have been put
together by the late King yet written all with his own hand, blotted and
interlined, so as, if indeed it was not given him by some priest, they
might be such arguments and reasons as had been inculcated from time to
time, and here recollected; and, in the conclusion, showing his looking
on the Protestant religion (and by name the Church of England) to be
without foundation, and consequently false and unsafe.When his Majesty
had shown him these originals, he was pleased to lend him the copies of
these two papers, attested at the bottom in four or five lines under his
own hand.This nice and curious passage I
thought fit to set down.Though all the arguments and objections were
altogether weak, and have a thousand times been answered by our divines;
they are such as their priests insinuate among their proselytes, as if
nothing were Catholic but the Church of Rome, no salvation out of that,
no reformation sufferable, bottoming all their errors on St.Peter's
successors' unerring dictatorship, but proving nothing with any reason,
or taking notice of any objection which could be made against it.Here
all was taken for granted, and upon it a resolution and preference
implied.I was heartily sorry to see all this, though it was no other than was
to be suspected, by his late Majesty's too great indifference, neglect,
and course of life, that he had been perverted, and for secular respects
only professed to be of another belief, and thereby giving great
advantage to our adversaries, both the Court and generally the youth and
great persons of the nation becoming dissolute and highly profane.God
was incensed to make his reign very troublesome and unprosperous, by
wars, plagues, fires, loss of reputation by an universal neglect of the
public for the love of a voluptuous and sensual life, which a vicious
Court had brought into credit.I think of it with sorrow and pity, when
I consider how good and debonair a nature that unhappy Prince was; what
opportunities he had to have made himself the most renowned King that
ever swayed the British scepter, had he been firm to that Church for
which his martyred and blessed father suffered; and had he been grateful
to Almighty God, who so miraculously restored him, with so excellent a
religion; had he endeavored to own and propagate it as he should have
done, not only for the good of his kingdom, but of all the Reformed
Churches in christendom, now weakened and near ruined through our
remissness and suffering them to be supplanted, persecuted, and
destroyed, as in France, which we took no notice of.The consequence of
this, time will show, and I wish it may proceed no further.The
emissaries and instruments of the Church of Rome will never rest till
they have crushed the Church of England, as knowing that alone to be
able to cope with them, and that they can never answer her fairly, but
lie abundantly open to the irresistible force of her arguments,
antiquity and purity of her doctrine, so that albeit it may move God,
for the punishment of a nation so unworthy, to eclipse again the
profession of her here, and darkness and superstition prevail, I am most
confident the doctrine of the Church of England will never be
extinguished, but remain visible, if not eminent, to the consummation of
the world.I have innumerable reasons that confirm me in this opinion,
which I forbear to mention here.In the meantime, as to the discourse of his Majesty with Mr.Pepys, and
those papers, as I do exceedingly prefer his Majesty's free and
ingenuous profession of what his own religion is, beyond concealment
upon any politic accounts, so I think him of a most sincere and honest
nature, one on whose word one may rely, and that he makes a conscience
of what he promises, to perform it.In this confidence, I hope that the
Church of England may yet subsist, and when it shall please God to open
his eyes and turn his heart (for that is peculiarly in the Lord's hands)
to flourish also.In all events, whatever does become of the Church of
England, it is certainly, of all the Christian professions on the earth,
the most primitive, apostolical, and excellent.I had my picture drawn this week by the famous
Kneller.[Sidenote: LONDON]

14th October, 1685.I went to London about finishing my lodgings at
Whitehall.Being the King's birthday, there was a solemn ball
at Court, and before it music of instruments and voices.I happened by
accident to stand the very next to the Queen and the King, who talked
with me about the music.The King was now building all that range from east
to west by the court and garden to the street, and making a new chapel
for the Queen, whose lodgings were to be in this new building, as also a
new Council chamber and offices next the south end of the banqueting
house.I returned home, next morning, to London.I accompanied my Lady Clarendon to her house at
Swallowfield, in Berks, dining by the way at Mr.Graham's lodge at
Bagshot; the house, newly repaired and capacious enough for a good
family, stands in a park.Hence, we went to Swallowfield; this house is after the ancient
building of honorable gentlemen's houses, when they kept up ancient
hospitality, but the gardens and waters as elegant as it is possible to
make a flat by art and industry, and no mean expense, my lady being so
extraordinarily skilled in the flowery part, and my lord in diligence of
planting; so that I have hardly seen a seat which shows more tokens of
it than what is to be found here, not only in the delicious and rarest
fruits of a garden, but in those innumerable timber trees in the ground
about the seat, to the greatest ornament and benefit of the place.There
is one orchard of 1,000 golden, and other cider pippins; walks and
groves of elms, limes, oaks, and other trees.The garden is so beset
with all manner of sweet shrubs, that it perfumes the air.The
distribution also of the quarters, walks, and parterres, is excellent.The nurseries, kitchen-garden full of the most desirable plants; two
very noble orangeries well furnished: but, above all, the canal and fish
ponds, the one fed with a white, the other with a black running water,
fed by a quick and swift river, so well and plentifully stored with
fish, that for pike, carp, bream, and tench, I never saw anything
approaching it.We had at every meal carp and pike of a size fit for the
table of a Prince, and what added to the delight was, to see the
hundreds taken by the drag, out of which, the cook standing by, we
pointed out what we had most mind to, and had carp that would have been
worth at London twenty shillings a piece.The waters are flagged about
with _Calamus aromaticus_, with which my lady has hung a closet, that
retains the smell very perfectly.There is also a certain sweet willow
and other exotics: also a very fine bowling-green, meadow, pasture, and
wood; in a word, all that can render a country seat delightful.There is
besides a well-furnished library in the house.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th October, 1685.We returned to London, having been treated with all
sorts of cheer and noble freedom by that most religious and virtuous
lady.She was now preparing to go for Ireland with her husband, made
Lord Deputy, and went to this country house and ancient seat of her
father and family, to set things in order during her absence; but never
were good people and neighbors more concerned than all the country (the
poor especially) for the departure of this charitable woman; everyone
was in tears, and she as unwilling to part from them.There was among
them a maiden of primitive life, the daughter of a poor laboring man,
who had sustained her parents (some time since dead) by her labor, and
has for many years refused marriage, or to receive any assistance from
the parish, besides the little hermitage my lady gives her rent-free;
she lives on four pence a day, which she gets by spinning; says she
abounds and can give alms to others, living in great humility and
content, without any apparent affectation, or singularity; she is
continually working, praying, or reading, gives a good account of her
knowledge in religion, visits the sick; is not in the least given to
talk; very modest, of a simple not unseemingly behavior; of a comely
countenance, clad very plain, but clean and tight.In sum, she appears a
saint of an extraordinary sort, in so religious a life, as is seldom met
with in villages now-a-days.I was invited to dine at Sir Stephen Fox's with my
Lord Lieutenant, where was such a dinner for variety of all things as I
had seldom seen, and it was so for the trial of a master-cook whom Sir
Stephen had recommended to go with his Lordship into Ireland; there were
all the dainties not only of the season, but of what art could add,
venison, plain solid meat, fowl, baked and boiled meats, banquet
[dessert], in exceeding plenty, and exquisitely dressed.There also
dined my Lord Ossory and Lady (the Duke of Beaufort's daughter), my Lady
Treasurer, Lord Cornbury, and other visitors.At the Royal Society, an urn full of bones was
presented, dug up in a highway, while repairing it, in a field in
Camberwell, in Surrey; it was found entire with its cover, among many
others, believed to be truly Roman and ancient.Sir Richard Bulkeley described to us a model of a chariot he had
invented, which it was not possible to overthrow in whatever uneven way
it was drawn, giving us a wonderful relation of what it had performed in
that kind, for ease, expedition, and safety; there were some
inconveniences yet to be remedied--it would not contain more than one
person; was ready to take fire every ten miles; and being placed and
playing on no fewer than ten rollers, it made a most prodigious noise,
almost intolerable.A remedy was to be sought for these inconveniences.I dined at our great Lord Chancellor Jefferies', who
used me with much respect.This was the late Chief-Justice who had newly
been the Western Circuit to try the Monmouth conspirators, and had
formerly done such severe justice among the obnoxious in Westminster
Hall, for which his Majesty dignified him by creating him first a Baron,
and now Lord Chancellor.He had some years past been conversant in
Deptford; is of an assured and undaunted spirit, and has served the
Court interest on all the hardiest occasions; is of nature cruel, and a
slave of the Court.The French persecution of the Protestants raging
with the utmost barbarity, exceeded even what the very heathens used:
innumerable persons of the greatest birth and riches leaving all their
earthly substance, and hardly escaping with their lives, dispersed
through all the countries of Europe.The French tyrant abrogated the
Edict of Nantes which had been made in favor of them, and without any
cause; on a sudden demolishing all their churches, banishing,
imprisoning, and sending to the galleys all the ministers; plundering
the common people, and exposing them to all sorts of barbarous usage by
soldiers sent to ruin and prey on them; taking away their children;
forcing people to the Mass, and then executing them as relapsers; they
burnt their libraries, pillaged their goods, ate up their fields and
substance, banished or sent the people to the galleys, and seized on
their estates.There had now been numbered to pass through Geneva only
(and that by stealth, for all the usual passages were strictly guarded
by sea and land) 40,000 toward Switzerland.In Holland, Denmark, and all
about Germany, were dispersed some hundred thousands; besides those in
England, where, though multitudes of all degree sought for shelter and
welcome as distressed Christians and confessors, they found least
encouragement, by a fatality of the times we were fallen into, and the
uncharitable indifference of such as should have embraced them; and I
prey it be not laid to our charge.The famous Claude fled to Holland;
Allix and several more came to London, and persons of great estates came
over, who had forsaken all.France was almost dispeopled, the bankers so
broken, that the tyrant's revenue was exceedingly diminished,
manufactures ceased, and everybody there, save the Jesuits, abhorred
what was done, nor did the <DW7>s themselves approve it.What the
further intention is, time will show; but doubtless portending some
revolution.I was shown the harangue which the Bishop of Valentia on Rhone made in
the name of the Clergy, celebrating the French King, as if he was a God,
for persecuting the poor Protestants, with this expression in it, "That
as his victory over heresy was greater than all the conquests of
Alexander and Caesar, it was but what was wished in England; and that God
seemed to raise the French King to this power and magnanimous action,
that he might be in capacity to assist in doing the same here."This
paragraph is very bold and remarkable; several reflecting on Archbishop
Usher's prophecy as now begun in France, and approaching the orthodox in
all other reformed churches.One thing was much taken notice of, that
the "Gazettes" which were still constantly printed twice a week,
informing us what was done all over Europe, never spoke of this
wonderful proceeding in France; nor was any relation of it published by
any, save what private letters and the persecuted fugitives brought.Whence this silence, I list not to conjecture; but it appeared very
extraordinary in a Protestant country that we should know nothing of
what Protestants suffered, while great collections were made for them in
foreign places, more hospitable and Christian to appearance.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1685.It being an extraordinarily wet morning, and myself
indisposed by a very great rheum, I did not go to church, to my very
great sorrow, it being the first Gunpowder Conspiracy anniversary that
had been kept now these eighty years under a prince of the Roman
religion.Bonfires were forbidden on this day; what does this portend!The King in his speech
required continuance of a standing force instead of a militia, and
indemnity and dispensation to Popish officers from the Test; demands
very unexpected and unpleasing to the Commons.He also required a supply
of revenue, which they granted; but returned no thanks to the King for
his speech, till farther consideration.The Commons postponed finishing the bill for the
Supply, to consider the Test, and Popish officers; this was carried but
by one voice.I dined at Lambeth, my Lord Archbishop carrying me
with him in his barge; there were my Lord Deputy of Ireland, the Bishops
of Ely and St.Sherlock, and other divines; Sir William
Hayward, Sir Paul Rycaut, etc.The Parliament was adjourned to February, several
both of Lords and Commons excepting against some passage of his
Majesty's speech relating to the Test, and continuance of Popish
officers in command.This was a great surprise in a Parliament which
people believed would have complied in all things.Popish pamphlets and pictures sold publicly; no books nor answers to
them appearing till long after.I resigned my trust for composing a difference
between Mr.Hitherto was a very wet, warm season.Lord Sunderland was declared President of the
Council, and yet to hold his Secretary's place.The forces disposed into
several quarters through the kingdom are very insolent, on which are
great complaints.Lord Brandon, tried for the late conspiracy, was condemned and pardoned;
so was Lord Grey, his accuser and witness.Persecution in France raging, the French insolently visit our vessels,
and take away the fugitive Protestants; some escape in barrels.[Sidenote: GREENWICH]

10th December, 1685.To Greenwich, being put into the new Commission of
Sewers.Patrick, Dean of Peterborough, preached at
Whitehall, before the Princess of Denmark, who, since his Majesty came
to the Crown, always sat in the King's closet, and had the same bowings
and ceremonies applied to the place where she was, as his Majesty had
when there in person.Slayer showed us an experiment of a wonderful
nature, pouring first a very cold liquor into a glass, and superfusing
on it another, to appearance cold and clear liquor also; it first
produced a white cloud, then boiling, divers coruscations and actual
flames of fire mingled with the liquor, which being a little shaken
together, fixed divers suns and stars of real fire, perfectly globular,
on the sides of the glass, and which there stuck like so many
constellations, burning most vehemently, and resembling stars and
heavenly bodies, and that for a long space.It seemed to exhibit a
theory of the eduction of light out of the chaos, and the fixing or
gathering of the universal light into luminous bodies.This matter, or
phosphorus, was made out of human blood and urine, elucidating the vital
flame, or heat in animal bodies.I accompanied my Lord-Lieutenant as far as St.Alban's, there going out of town with him near 200 coaches of all the
great officers and nobility.The next morning taking leave, I returned
to London.I dined at the great entertainment his Majesty gave
the Venetian Ambassadors, Signors Zenno and Justiniani, accompanied with
ten more noble Venetians of their most illustrious families, Cornaro,
Maccenigo, etc., who came to congratulate their Majesties coming to the
Crown.The dinner was most magnificent and plentiful, at four tables,
with music, kettledrums, and trumpets, which sounded upon a whistle at
every health.The banquet [dessert] was twelve vast chargers piled up so
high that those who sat one against another could hardly see each other.Of these sweetmeats, which doubtless were some days piling up in that
exquisite manner, the Ambassadors touched not, but leaving them to the
spectators who came out of curiosity to see the dinner, were exceedingly
pleased to see in what a moment of time all that curious work was
demolished, the comfitures voided, and the tables cleared.Thus his
Majesty entertained them three days, which (for the table only) cost him
L600, as the Clerk of the Greencloth (Sir William Boreman) assured me.Dinner ended, I saw their procession, or cavalcade, to Whitehall,
innumerable coaches attending.The two Ambassadors had four coaches of
their own, and fifty footmen (as I remember), besides other equipage as
splendid as the occasion would permit, the Court being still in
mourning.Thence, I went to the audience which they had in the Queen's
presence chamber, the Banqueting House being full of goods and furniture
till the galleries on the garden-side, council chamber, and new chapel,
now in the building, were finished.They went to their audience in those
plain black gowns and caps which they constantly wear in the city of
Venice.I was invited to have accompanied the two Ambassadors in their
coach to supper that night, returning now to their own lodgings, as no
longer at the King's expense; but, being weary, I excused myself.My Lord Treasurer made me dine with him, where I
became acquainted with Monsieur Barillon, the French Ambassador, a
learned and crafty advocate.[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th December, 1685.Turner, brother to the Bishop of Ely, and
sometime tutor to my son, preached at Whitehall on Mark viii.38,
concerning the submission of Christians to their persecutors, in which
were some passages indiscreet enough, considering the time, and the rage
of the inhuman French tyrant against the poor Protestants.Our patent for executing the office of Privy Seal
during the absence of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, being this day
sealed by the Lord Chancellor, we went afterward to St.James, where the
Court then was on occasion of building at Whitehall; his Majesty
delivered the seal to my Lord Tiviot and myself, the other Commissioners
not being come, and then gave us his hand to kiss.There were the two
Venetian Ambassadors and a world of company; among the rest the first
Popish Nuncio that had been in England since the Reformation; so
wonderfully were things changed, to the universal jealousy.We were all three Commissioners sworn on our knees
by the Clerk of the Crown, before my Lord Chancellor, three several
oaths: allegiance, supremacy, and the oath belonging to the Lord Privy
Seal, which last we took standing.After this, the Lord Chancellor
invited us all to dinner, but it being Christmas eve we desired to be
excused, intending at three in the afternoon to seal divers things which
lay ready at the office; so attended by three of the Clerks of the
Signet, we met and sealed.Among other things was a pardon to West, who
being privy to the late conspiracy, had revealed the accomplices to save
his own neck.There were also another pardon and two indenizations; and
so agreeing to a fortnight's vacation, I returned home.Recollecting the passages of the year past, and
having made up accounts, humbly besought Almighty God to pardon those my
sins which had provoked him to discompose my sorrowful family; that he
would accept of our humiliation, and in his good time restore comfort to
it.I also blessed God for all his undeserved mercies and preservations,
begging the continuance of his grace and preservation.The winter had
hitherto been extraordinarily wet and mild.Imploring the continuance of God's providential
care for the year now entered, I went to the public devotions.The Dean
of the Chapel and Clerk of the Closet put out, viz, Bishop of London and
..., and Rochester and Durham put in their places; the former had
opposed the toleration intended, and shown a worthy zeal for the
reformed religion as established.I dined with the Archbishop of York, where was Peter
Walsh, that Romish priest so well known for his moderation, professing
the Church of England to be a true member of the Catholic Church.He is
used to go to our public prayers without scruple, and did not
acknowledge the Pope's infallibility, only primacy of order.Passed the Privy Seal, among others, the creation of
Mrs.Sedley (concubine to ----) Countess of Dorchester, which the Queen
took very grievously, so as for two dinners, standing near her, I
observed she hardly ate one morsel, nor spoke one word to the King, or
to any about her, though at other times she used to be extremely
pleasant, full of discourse and good humor.The Roman Catholics were
also very angry: because they had so long valued the sanctity of their
religion and proselytes.Dryden, the famous playwriter, and his two sons, and Mrs.Nelly (miss to
the late ----), were said to go to mass; such proselytes were no great
loss to the Church.This night was burnt to the ground my Lord Montague's palace in
Bloomsbury, than which for painting and furniture there was nothing more
glorious in England.This happened by the negligence of a servant
airing, as they call it, some of the goods by the fire in a moist
season; indeed, so wet and mild a season had scarce been seen in man's
memory.At this Seal there also passed the creation of Sir Henry Waldegrave to
be a Peer.He had married one of the King's natural daughters by Mrs.These two Seals my brother Commissioners passed in the
morning before I came to town, at which I was not displeased.We
likewise passed Privy Seals for L276,000 upon several accounts,
pensions, guards, wardrobes, privy purse, etc., besides divers pardons,
and one more which I must not forget (and which by Providence I was not
present at) one Mr.Lytcott to be Secretary to the Ambassador to Rome.We being three Commissioners, any two were a quorum.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st January, 1686.I dined at my Lady Arlington's, Groom of the Stole
to the Queen Dowager, at Somerset House, where dined the Countesses of
Devonshire, Dover, etc.; in all eleven ladies of quality, no man but
myself being there.Unheard-of cruelties to the persecuted Protestants
of France, such as hardly any age has seen the like, even among the
Pagans.Being the day on which his Majesty began his reign,
by order of Council it was to be solemnized with a particular office and
sermon, which the Bishop of Ely preached at Whitehall on Numb.12; a
Court oration upon the regal office.It was much wondered at, that this
day, which was that of his late Majesty's death, should be kept as a
festival, and not the day of the present King's coronation.It is said
to have been formerly the custom, though not till now since the reign of
King James I.

The Duchess of Monmouth, being in the same seat with me at church,
appeared with a very sad and afflicted countenance.I took the test in Westminster Hall, before the Lord
Chief Justice.I now came to lodge at Whitehall, in the Lord Privy
Seal's lodgings.My great cause was heard by my Lord Chancellor, who
granted me a rehearing.I had six eminent lawyers, my antagonist three,
whereof one was the smooth-tongued solicitor, whom my Lord Chancellor
reproved in great passion for a very small occasion.Blessed be God for
his great goodness to me this day!Many bloody and notorious duels were fought about
this time.Stanley, brother to the Earl
of [Derby], indeed upon an almost insufferable provocation.It is to be
hoped that his Majesty will at last severely remedy this unchristian
custom.Lord Sunderland was now Secretary of State, President of the Council,
and Premier Minister.Came Sir Gilbert Gerrard to treat with me about his
son's marrying my daughter, Susanna.The father being obnoxious, and in
some suspicion and displeasure of the King, I would receive no proposal
till his Majesty had given me leave; which he was pleased to do; but,
after several meetings we broke off, on his not being willing to secure
anything competent for my daughter's children; besides that I found most
of his estate was in the coal-pits as far off as Newcastle, and on
leases from the Bishop of Durham, who had power to make concurrent
leases, with other difficulties.Frampton, Bishop of Gloucester, preached on Psalm
xliv.17, 18, 19, showing the several afflictions of the Church of
Christ from the primitive to this day, applying exceedingly to the
present conjuncture, when many were wavering in their minds, and great
temptations appearing through the favor now found by the <DW7>s, so as
the people were full of jealousies and discouragement.The Bishop
magnified the Church of England, exhorting to constancy and
perseverance.A Council of the Royal Society about disposing of Dr.Ray's book of Fishes, which was printed at the expense of the Society.A docket was to be sealed, importing a lease of
twenty-one years to one Hall, who styled himself his Majesty's printer
(he lately turned <DW7>) for the printing missals, offices, lives of
saints, portals, primers, etc., books expressly forbidden to be printed
or sold, by divers Acts of Parliament; I refused to put my seal to it,
making my exceptions, so it was laid by.The Bishop of Bath and Wells preached on John vi.17,
a most excellent and pathetic discourse: after he had recommended the
duty of fasting and other penitential duties, he exhorted to constancy
in the Protestant religion, detestation of the unheard-of cruelties of
the French, and stirring up to a liberal contribution.This sermon was
the more acceptable, as it was unexpected from a Bishop who had
undergone the censure of being inclined to Popery, the contrary whereof
no man could show more.This indeed did all our Bishops, to the
disabusing and reproach of all their delators: for none were more
zealous against Popery than they were.I was at a review of the army about London in Hyde
Park, about 6,000 horse and foot, in excellent order; his Majesty and
infinity of people being present.I went to my house in the country, refusing to be
present at what was to pass at the Privy Seal the next day.Tenison preached an incomparable discourse at Whitehall, on
Timothy ii.Cradock (Provost of Eaton) preached at the same
place, on Psalm xlix.13, showing the vanity of earthly enjoyments.White, Bishop of Peterborough, preached in a very
eloquent style, on Matthew xxvi.29, submission to the will of God on
all accidents, and at all times.The Duke of Northumberland (a natural son of the late
King by the Duchess of Cleveland) marrying very meanly, with the help of
his brother Grafton, attempted in vain to spirit away his wife.A Brief was read in all churches for relieving the French Protestants,
who came here for protection from the unheard-of cruelties of the King.Sir Edward Hales, a <DW7>, made Governor of Dover
Castle.The Archbishop of York now died of the smallpox, aged
62, a corpulent man.He was my special loving friend, and while Bishop
of Rochester (from whence he was translated) my excellent neighbor.He
was an inexpressible loss to the whole church, and that Province
especially, being a learned, wise, stout, and most worthy prelate; I
look on this as a great stroke to the poor Church of England, now in
this defecting period.In the afternoon I went to Camberwell, to visit Dr.After sermon, I accompanied him to his house, where he showed me
the Life and Letters of the late learned Primate of Armagh (Usher), and
among them that letter of Bishop Bramhall's to the Primate, giving
notice of the Popish practices to pervert this nation, by sending a
hundred priests into England, who were to conform themselves to all
sectaries and conditions for the more easily dispersing their doctrine
among us.This letter was the cause of the whole impression being
seized, upon pretense that it was a political or historical account of
things not relating to theology, though it had been licensed by the
Bishop; which plainly showed what an interest the <DW7>s now had,--that
a Protestant book, containing the life and letters of so eminent a man,
was not to be published.There were also many letters to and from most
of the learned persons his correspondents in Europe.The book will, I
doubt not, struggle through this unjust impediment.Several Judges were put out, and new complying ones put in.This day was read in our church the Brief for a
collection for relief of the Protestant French so cruelly, barbarously,
and inhumanly oppressed without any thing being laid to their charge.It
had been long expected, and at last with difficulty procured to be
published, the interest of the French Ambassador obstructing it.There being a Seal, it was feared we should be required
to pass a docket dispensing with Dr.Obadiah Walker and four more,
whereof one was an apostate curate of Putney, the others officers of
University College, Oxford, who hold their masterships, fellowships, and
cures, and keep public schools, and enjoy all former emoluments,
notwithstanding they no more frequented or used the public forms of
prayers, or communion, with the Church of England, or took the Test or
oaths of allegiance and supremacy, contrary to twenty Acts of
Parliament; which dispensation being also contrary to his Majesty's own
gracious declaration at the beginning of his reign, gave umbrage (as
well it might) to every good Protestant; nor could we safely have passed
it under the Privy Seal, wherefore it was done by immediate warrant,
signed by Mr.This Walker was a learned person, of a monkish life, to whose tuition I
had more than thirty years since recommended the sons of my worthy
friend, Mr.Hyldyard, of Horsley in Surrey, believing him to be far from
what he proved--a hypocritical concealed <DW7>--by which he perverted
the eldest son of Mr.Hyldyard, Sir Edward Hale's eldest son, and
several more, to the great disturbance of the whole nation, as well as
of the University, as by his now public defection appeared.All engines
being now at work to bring in Popery, which God in mercy prevent![Sidenote: LONDON]

This day was burned in the old Exchange, by the common hangman, a
translation of a book written by the famous Monsieur Claude, relating
only matters of fact concerning the horrid massacres and barbarous
proceedings of the French King against his Protestant subjects, without
any refutation of any facts therein; so mighty a power and ascendant
here had the French Ambassador, who was doubtless in great indignation
at the pious and truly generous charity of all the nation, for the
relief of those miserable sufferers who came over for shelter.About this time also, the Duke of Savoy, instigated by the French King
to extirpate the Protestants of Piedmont, slew many thousands of those
innocent people, so that there seemed to be an universal design to
destroy all that would not go to mass, throughout Europe._Quod Avertat
D. O.M.!_ No faith in Princes!I refused to put the Privy Seal to Doctor Walker's
license for printing and publishing divers Popish books, of which I
complained both to my Lord of Canterbury (with whom I went to advise in
the Council Chamber), and to my Lord Treasurer that evening at his
lodgings.My Lord of Canterbury's advice was, that I should follow my
own conscience therein; Mr.Treasurer's, that if in conscience I could
dispense with it, for any other hazard he believed there was none.Notwithstanding this, I persisted in my refusal.There was no sermon on this anniversary, as there
usually had been ever since the reign of the present King.Such storms, rain, and foul weather, seldom known at this
time of the year.The camp at Hounslow Heath, from sickness and other
inconveniences of weather, forced to retire to quarters; the storms
being succeeded by excessive hot weather, many grew sick.Great feasting
there, especially in Lord Dunbarton's quarters.There were many
jealousies and discourses of what was the meaning of this encampment.A seal this day; mostly pardons and discharges of Knight Baronets'
fees, which having been passed over for so many years, did greatly
disoblige several families who had served his Majesty.Lord Tyrconnel
gone to Ireland, with great powers and commissions, giving as much cause
of talk as the camp, especially nineteen new Privy-Councillors and
Judges being now made, among which but three Protestants, and Tyrconnel
made General.New judges also here, among which was Milton, a <DW7> (brother to that
Milton who wrote for the Regicides), who presumed to take his place
without passing the Test.Scotland refused to grant liberty of mass to
the <DW7>s there.The Protestants in Savoy
successfully resist the French dragoons sent to murder them.The King's chief physician in Scotland apostatizing from the Protestant
religion, does of his own accord publish his recantation at Edinburg.I went to see Middleton's receptacle of water at the
New River, and the New Spa Wells near.My Lord Treasurer settled my great business with Mr.Pretyman, to which I hope God will at last give a prosperous issue.Sharp and Tully,
proceeded to silence and suspend divers excellent divines for preaching
against Popery.I had this day been married thirty-nine years--blessed
be God for all his mercies!The new very young Lord Chief-Justice Herbert declared on the bench,
that the government of England was entirely in the King; that the Crown
was absolute; that penal laws were powers lodged in the Crown to enable
the King to force the execution of the law, but were not bars to bind
the King's power; that he could pardon all offenses against the law, and
forgive the penalties, and why could he not dispense with them; by which
the Test was abolished?Great jealousies as to
what would be the end of these proceedings.I supped with the Countess of Rochester, where was also
the Duchess of Buckingham and Madame de Governe, whose daughter was
married to the Marquis of Halifax's son.She made me a character of the
French King and Dauphin, and of the persecution; that they kept much of
the cruelties from the King's knowledge; that the Dauphin was so afraid
of his father, that he dared not let anything appear of his sentiments;
that he hated letters and priests, spent all his time in hunting, and
seemed to take no notice of what was passing.This lady was of a great family and fortune, and had fled hither for
refuge.I waited on the Archbishop at Lambeth, where I dined and
met the famous preacher and writer, Dr.Allix, doubtless a most
excellent and learned person.The Archbishop and he spoke Latin
together, and that very readily.Meggot, Dean of Winchester preached before the
household in St.George's Chapel at Windsor, the late King's glorious
chapel now seized on by the mass priests.Cartwright, Dean of Ripon,
preached before the great men of the Court in the same place.We had now the sad news of the Bishop of Oxford's death, an
extraordinary loss to the poor Church at this time.Many candidates for
his Bishopric and Deanery, Dr.Parker, South, Aldrich, etc.Walker
(now apostatizing) came to Court, and was doubtless very busy.Note, that standing by the Queen at basset (cards), I
observed that she was exceedingly concerned for the loss of L80; her
outward affability much changed to stateliness, since she has been
exalted.The season very rainy and inconvenient for the camps.Was sealed at our office the constitution of certain
commissioners to take upon them full power of all Ecclesiastical
affairs, in as unlimited a manner, or rather greater, than the late High
Commission-Court, abrogated by Parliament; for it had not only faculty
to inspect and visit all Bishops' dioceses, but to change what laws and
statutes they should think fit to alter among the colleges, though
founded by private men; to punish, suspend, fine, etc., give oaths and
call witnesses.The main drift was to suppress zealous preachers.In
sum, it was the whole power of a Vicar-General--note the consequence!Of
the clergy the commissioners were the Archbishop of Canterbury
[Sancroft], Bishop of Durham [Crewe], and Rochester [Sprat]; of the
Temporals, the Lord Treasurer, the Lord Chancellor [Jefferies] (who
alone was ever to be of the quorum), the Chief justice [Herbert], and
Lord President [Earl of Sunderland].I went to see Sir John Chardin, at Greenwich.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th August, 1686.I dined at Signor Verrio's, the famous Italian
painter, now settled in his Majesty's garden at St.James's, which he
had made a very delicious paradise.Our vicar gone to dispose of his country living in
Rutlandshire, having St.Dunstan in the east given him by the Archbishop
of Canterbury.I went to visit the Marquis Ravigne, now my neighbor at Greenwich,
retired from the persecution in France.He was the deputy of all the
Protestants of that kingdom in the parliament of Paris, and several
times Ambassador in this and other Courts; a person of great learning
and experience.Compton, Bishop of London, was on Monday
suspended, on pretense of not silencing Dr.Giles's, for
something of a sermon in which he zealously reproved the doctrine of the
Roman Catholics.The Bishop having consulted the civilians, they told
him he could not by any law proceed against Dr.Sharp without producing
witnesses, and impleaded according to form; but it was overruled by my
Lord Chancellor, and the Bishop sentenced without so much as being heard
to any purpose.This was thought a very extraordinary way of proceeding,
and was universally resented, and so much the rather for that two
Bishops, Durham and Rochester, sitting in the commission and giving
their suffrages the Archbishop of Canterbury refused to sit among them.He was only suspended _ab officio_, and that was soon after taken off.He was brother to the Earl of Northampton, had once been a soldier, had
traveled in Italy, but became a sober, grave, and excellent prelate.Buda now taken from the Turks; a form of
thanksgiving was ordered to be used in the (as yet remaining) Protestant
chapels and church of Whitehall and Windsor.The King of Denmark was besieging Hamburg, no doubt by the French
contrivance, to embroil the Protestant Princes in a new war, that
Holland, etc., being engaged, matter for new quarrel might arise: the
unheard-of persecution of the poor Protestants still raging more than
ever.The Danes retire from Hamburg, the Protestant
Princes appearing for their succor, and the Emperor sending his
minatories to the King of Denmark, and also requiring the restoration of
the Duke of Saxe Gotha.Thus it pleased God to defeat the French
designs, which were evidently to kindle a new war.His Majesty's birthday; I was at his rising in his
bedchamber, afterward in the park, where four companies of guards were
drawn up.The officers, etc., wonderfully rich and gallant; they did not
head their troops, but their next officers, the colonels being on
horseback by the King while they marched.The ladies not less splendid
at Court, where there was a ball at night; but small appearance of
quality.All the shops both in the city and suburbs were shut up, and
kept as solemnly as any holiday.Bonfires at night in Westminster, but
forbidden in the city.Patrick, Dean of Peterborough, preached at
Covent Garden Church on Ephes.18, 19, showing the custom of the
primitive saints in serving God with hymns, and their frequent use of
them upon all occasions: touching the profane way of mirth and
intemperance of this ungodly age.Afterward I visited my Lord Chief
Justice of Ireland, with whom I had long and private discourse
concerning the miserable condition that kingdom was like to be in, if
Tyrconnel's counsel should prevail at Court.Went with the Countess of Sunderland to Cranbourne,
a lodge and walk of my Lord Godolphin's in Windsor park.There was one
room in the house spared in the pulling down the old one, because the
late Duchess of York was born in it; the rest was built and added to it
by Sir George Carteret, Treasurer of the Navy; and since, the whole was
purchased by my Lord Godolphin, who spoke to me to go see it, and advise
what trees were fit to be cut down to improve the dwelling, being
environed with old rotten pollards, which corrupt the air.It stands on
a knoll which though insensibly rising, gives it a prospect over the
Keep of Windsor, about three miles N. E. of it.The ground is clayey and
moist; the water stark naught; the park is pretty; the house tolerable,
and gardens convenient.After dinner, we came back to London, having two
coaches both going and coming, of six horses apiece, which we changed at
Hounslow.Warren preached before the Princess at
Whitehall, on 5th Matthew, of the blessedness of the pure in heart, most
elegantly describing the bliss of the beatifical vision.In the
afternoon, Sir George Wheeler, knight and baronet, preached on the 4th
Matt.Margaret's, an honest and
devout discourse, and pretty tolerably performed.This gentleman coming
from his travels out of Greece, fell in love with the daughter of Sir
Thomas Higgins, his Majesty's resident at Venice, niece to the Earl of
Bath, and married her.When they returned into England, being honored
with knighthood, he would needs turn preacher, and took orders.He
published a learned and ingenious book of his travels, and is a very
worthy person, a little formal and particular, but exceedingly devout.There was a triumphant show of the Lord Mayor both
by land and water, with much solemnity, when yet his power has been so
much diminished, by the loss of the city's former charter.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1686.Birch preached very boldly against the <DW7>s, from John xvi.Tillotson in Lincoln's Inn chapel, on the same
text, but more cautiously.I went with part of my family to pass the
melancholy winter in London at my son's house in Arundel Buildings.I dined at my Lady Arlington's, Groom of the Stole
to the Queen Dowager at Somerset House, where dined divers French
noblemen, driven out of their country by the persecution.I carried the Countess of Sunderland to see the
rarities of one Mr.Charlton in the Middle Temple, who showed us such a
collection as I had never seen in all my travels abroad either of
private gentlemen, or princes.It consisted of miniatures, drawings,
shells, insects, medals, natural things, animals (of which divers, I
think 100, were kept in glasses of spirits of wine), minerals, precious
stones, vessels, curiosities in amber, crystal, agate, etc.; all being
very perfect and rare of their kind, especially his books of birds,
fish, flowers, and shells, drawn and miniatured to the life.He told us
that one book stood him in L300; it was painted by that excellent
workman, whom the late Gaston, Duke of Orleans, employed.This
gentleman's whole collection, gathered by himself, traveling over most
parts of Europe, is estimated at L8,000.He appeared to be a modest and
obliging person.[62]

    [Footnote 62: This collection was afterward purchased by Sir Hans
    Sloane, and now forms part oL the British Museum.][Sidenote: LONDON]

29th December, 1686.I went to hear the music of the Italians in the
new chapel, now first opened publicly at Whitehall for the Popish
Service.Nothing can be finer than the magnificent marble work and
architecture at the end, where are four statues, representing St.Paul, and the Church, in white marble, the work of Mr.Gibbons, with all the carving and pillars of exquisite art and great
cost.The altar piece is the Salutation; the volto in _fresco_, the
Assumption of the blessed Virgin, according to their tradition, with our
blessed Savior, and a world of figures painted by Verrio.The throne
where the King and Queen sit is very glorious, in a closet above, just
opposite to the altar.Here we saw the Bishop in his mitre and rich
copes, with six or seven Jesuits and others in rich copes, sumptuously
habited, often taking off and putting on the Bishop's mitre, who sat in
a chair with arms pontifically, was adored and censed by three Jesuits
in their copes; then he went to the altar and made divers cringes, then
censing the images and glorious tabernacle placed on the altar, and now
and then changing place: the crosier, which was of silver, was put into
his hand with a world of mysterious ceremony, the music playing, with
singing.I could not have believed I should ever have seen such things
in the King of England's palace, after it had pleased God to enlighten
this nation; but our great sin has, for the present, eclipsed the
blessing, which I hope he will in mercy and his good time restore to its
purity.He wrote excellently, in answer
to the Bishop of Meaux.A Seal to confirm a gift of L4,000 per annum for 99
years to the Lord Treasurer out of the Post Office, and L1,700 per annum
for ever out of Lord Grey's estate.There was now another change of the great officers.The Treasury was put
into commission, two professed <DW7>s among them, viz, Lords Bellasis
and Dover, joined with the old ones, Lord Godolphin, Sir Stephen Fox,
and Sir John Ernley.Much expectation of several great men declaring
themselves <DW7>s.Lord Tyrconnel gone to succeed the Lord-Lieutenant
[Clarendon] in Ireland, to the astonishment of all sober men, and to the
evident ruin of the Protestants in that kingdom, as well as of its great
improvement going on.Much discourse that all the White Staff officers
and others should be dismissed for adhering to their religion.Popish
Justices of the Peace established in all counties, of the meanest of the
people; Judges ignorant of the law, and perverting it--so furiously do
the Jesuits drive, and even compel Princes to violent courses, and
destruction of an excellent government both in Church and State.God of
his infinite mercy open our eyes, and turn our hearts, and establish his
truth with peace!The Lord Jesus defend his little flock, and preserve
this threatened church and nation!I saw the Queen's new apartment at Whitehall, with
her new bed, the embroidery of which cost L3,000.The carving about the
chimney piece, by Gibbons, is incomparable.I heard the famous eunuch, Cifaccio, sing in the new
Popish chapel this afternoon; it was indeed very rare, and with great
skill.He came over from Rome, esteemed one of the best voices in Italy.Chetwin preached at Whitehall on Rom.18, a
very quaint, neat discourse of Moral righteousness.Came out a proclamation for universal liberty of
conscience in Scotland, and depensation from all tests and laws to the
contrary, as also capacitating <DW7>s to be chosen into all offices of
trust.Meggott, Dean of Winchester, preached before the
Princess of Denmark, on Matt.In the afternoon, I went out of
town to meet my Lord Clarendon, returning from Ireland.His Majesty sent for the Commissioners of the Privy
Seal this morning into his bedchamber, and told us that though he had
thought fit to dispose of the Seal into a single hand, yet he would so
provide for us, as it should appear how well he accepted our faithful
and loyal service with many gracious expressions to this effect; upon
which we delivered the Seal into his hands.It was by all the world both
hoped and expected, that he would have restored it to my Lord Clarendon;
but they were astonished to see it given to Lord Arundel, of Wardour, a
zealous Roman Catholic.Indeed it was very hard, and looked very
unkindly, his Majesty (as my Lord Clarendon protested to me, on my going
to visit him and long discoursing with him about the affairs of Ireland)
finding not the least failure of duty in him during his government of
that kingdom, so that his recall plainly appeared to be from the
stronger influence of the <DW7>s, who now got all the preferments.Most of the great officers, both in the Court and country, Lords and
others, were dismissed, as they would not promise his Majesty their
consent to the repeal of the test and penal statutes against Popish
Recusants.To this end, most of the Parliament men were spoken to in his
Majesty's closet, and such as refused, if in any place of office or
trust, civil or military, were put out of their employments.This was a
time of great trial; but hardly one of them assented, which put the
Popish interest much backward.The English clergy everywhere preached
boldly against their superstition and errors, and were wonderfully
followed by the people.Not one considerable proselyte was made in all
this time.The party were exceedingly put to the worst by the preaching
and writing of the Protestants in many excellent treatises, evincing the
doctrine and discipline of the reformed religion, to the manifest
disadvantage of their adversaries.To this did not a little contribute
the sermon preached at Whitehall before the Princess of Denmark and a
great crowd of people, and at least thirty of the greatest nobility, by
Dr.Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells, on John viii.46 (the Gospel of the
day), describing through his whole discourse the blasphemies, perfidy,
wresting of Scripture, preference of tradition before it, spirit of
persecution, superstition, legends, and fables of the Scribes and
Pharisees, so that all the auditory understood his meaning of a parallel
between them and the Romish priests, and their new Trent religion.He
exhorted his audience to adhere to the written Word, and to persevere in
the Faith taught in the Church of England, whose doctrine for Catholic
and soundness he preferred to all the communities and churches of
Christians in the world; concluding with a kind of prophecy, that
whatever it suffered, it should after a short trial emerge to the
confusion of her adversaries and the glory of God.I went this evening to see the order of the boys and children at
Christ's Hospital.There were near 800 boys and girls so decently clad,
cleanly lodged, so wholesomely fed, so admirably taught, some the
mathematics, especially the forty of the late King's foundation, that I
was delighted to see the progress some little youths of thirteen or
fourteen years of age had made.I saw them at supper, visited their
dormitories, and much admired the order, economy, and excellent
government of this most charitable seminary.Some are taught for the
Universities, others designed for seamen, all for trades and callings.The girls are instructed in all such work as becomes their sex and may
fit them for good wives, mistresses, and to be a blessing to their
generation.They sang a psalm before they sat down to supper in the
great Hall, to an organ which played all the time, with such cheerful
harmony, that it seemed to me a vision of angels.I came from the place
with infinite satisfaction, having never seen a more noble, pious, and
admirable charity.[63] The
foundation was of that pious Prince King Edward VI., whose picture (held
to be an original of Holbein) is in the court where the Governors meet
to consult on the affairs of the Hospital, and his statue in white
marble stands in a niche of the wall below, as you go to the church,
which is a modern, noble, and ample fabric.This foundation has had, and
still has, many benefactors.[Footnote 63: This is by no means the case now.]I saw a trial of those devilish, murdering, mischief
doing engines called bombs, shot out of the mortar piece on Blackheath.The distance that they are cast, the destruction they make where they
fall, is prodigious.Martin's to a crowd of people not to be expressed, nor the wonderful
eloquence of this admirable preacher; the text was Matt.36 to
verse 40, describing the bitterness of our Blessed Savior's agony, the
ardor of his love, the infinite obligations we have to imitate his
patience and resignation; the means by watching against temptations, and
over ourselves with fervent prayer to attain it, and the exceeding
reward in the end.Upon all which he made most pathetical discourses.The Communion followed, at which I was participant.Tenison's with the Bishop and that young, most learned, pious, and
excellent preacher, Mr.In the afternoon, I went to hear Mr.Wake
at the newly built church of St.34, upon the
subject of taking up the cross, and strenuously behaving ourselves in
time of persecution, as this now threatened to be.His Majesty again prorogued the Parliament, foreseeing it would not
remit the laws against <DW7>s, by the extraordinary zeal and bravery of
its members, and the free renunciation of the great officers both in
Court and state, who would not be prevailed with for any temporal
concern.During the service, a man came into near the middle of the
church, with his sword drawn, with several others in that posture; in
this jealous time it put the congregation into great confusion, but it
appeared to be one who fled for sanctuary, being pursued by bailiffs.I had a rehearing of my great cause at the Chancery in
Westminster Hall, having seven of the most learned Counsel, my adversary
five, among which were the Attorney General and late Solicitor Finch,
son to the Lord Chancellor Nottingham.The account was at last brought
to one article of the surcharge, and referred to a Master.The cause
lasted two hours and more.In the last week there was issued a Dispensation from
all obligations and tests, by which Dissenters and <DW7>s especially
had public liberty of exercising their several ways of worship, without
incurring the penalty of the many Laws and Acts of Parliament to the
contrary.This was purely obtained by the <DW7>s, thinking thereby to
ruin the Church of England, being now the only church which so admirably
and strenuously opposed their superstition.There was a wonderful
concourse of people at the Dissenters' meeting house in this parish, and
the parish church [Deptford] left exceedingly thin.What this will end
in, God Almighty only knows; but it looks like confusion, which I pray
God avert.[Sidenote: LONDON]

11th April, 1687.To London about my suit, some terms of accommodation
being proposed.I heard the famous singer, Cifaccio, esteemed the best
in Europe.Indeed, his holding out and delicateness in extending and
loosing a note with incomparable softness and sweetness, was admirable;
for the rest I found him a mere wanton, effeminate child, very coy, and
proudly conceited, to my apprehension.He touched the harpsichord to his
voice rarely well.This was before a select number of particular persons
whom Mr.Pepys invited to his house; and this was obtained by particular
favor and much difficulty, the Signor much disdaining to show his talent
to any but princes.At Greenwich, at the conclusion of the Church service,
there was a French sermon preached after the use of the English Liturgy
translated into French, to a congregation of about 100 French refugees,
of whom Monsieur Ruvigny was the chief, and had obtained the use of the
church, after the parish service was ended.The preacher pathetically
exhorted to patience, constancy, and reliance on God amidst all their
sufferings, and the infinite rewards to come.I dined with Mynheer Diskvelts, the Holland Ambassador, a
prudent and worthy person.There dined Lord Middleton, principal
Secretary of State, Lord Pembroke, Lord Lumley, Lord Preston, Colonel
Fitzpatrick, and Sir John Chardin.After dinner, the Ambassador
discoursed of and deplored the stupid folly of our politics, in
suffering the French to take Luxemburg, it being a place of the most
concern to have been defended, for the interest not only of the
Netherlands, but of England.[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th May, 1687.Lord Sunderland being Lord President and
Secretary of State, was made Knight of the Garter and Prime favorite.This day there was such a storm of wind as had seldom happened, being a
sort of hurricane.It kept the flood out of the Thames, so that people
went on foot over several places above bridge.Also an earthquake in
several places in England about the time of the storm.Pretyman, after
my tedious suit.I went to London, it having pleased his Majesty to grant
me a Privy Seal for L6,000, for discharge of the debt I had been so many
years persecuted for, it being indeed for money drawn over by my
father-in-law, Sir R. Browne, during his residence in the Court of
France, and so with a much greater sum due to Sir Richard from his
Majesty; and now this part of the arrear being paid, there remains yet
due to me, as executor of Sir Richard, above L6,500 more; but this
determining an expensive Chancery suit has been so great a mercy and
providence to me (through the kindness and friendship to me of Lord
Godolphin, one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury,) that I do
acknowledge it with all imaginable thanks to my gracious God.I visited my Lady Pierpoint, daughter to Sir John
Evelyn, of Deane [in Wilts], now widow of Mr.Pierpoint, and mother of
the Earl of Kingston.She was now engaged in the marriage of my cousin,
Evelyn Pierpoint, her second son.There was about this time brought into the Downs a vast treasure, which
was sunk in a Spanish galleon about forty-five years ago, somewhere near
Hispaniola, or the Bahama islands, and was now weighed up by some
gentlemen, who were at the charge of divers, etc., to the enriching them
beyond all expectation.The Duke of Albemarle's share [Governor of
Jamaica] came to, I believe, L50,000.Some private gentlemen who
adventured L100, gained from L8,000 to L10,000.His Majesty's tenth was
L10,000.The Camp was now again pitched at Hounslow, the Commanders profusely
vying in the expense and magnificence of tents.21, upon the danger
of relapsing into sin.After this, I went and heard M. Lamot, an
eloquent French preacher at Greenwich, on Prov.8, 9, a consolatory
discourse to the poor and religious refugees who escaped out of France
in the cruel persecution.I went to Hampton Court to give his Majesty thanks for
his late gracious favor, though it was but granting what was due.While
I was in the Council Chamber, came in some persons, at the head of whom
was a formal man with a large roll of parchment in his hand, being an
ADDRESS (as he said, for he introduced it with a speech) of the people
of Coventry, giving his Majesty their great acknowledgments for his
granting a liberty of conscience; he added that this was not the
application of one party only, but the unanimous address of Church of
England men, Presbyterians, Independents, and Anabaptists, to show how
extensive his Majesty's grace was, as taking in all parties to his
indulgence and protection, which had removed all dissensions and
animosities, which would not only unite them in bonds of Christian
charity, but exceedingly encourage their future industry, to the
improvement of trade, and spreading his Majesty's glory throughout the
world; and that now he had given to God his empire, God would establish
his; with expressions of great loyalty and submission; and so he gave
the roll to the King, which being returned to him again, his Majesty
caused him to read.The address was short, but much to the substance of
the speech of their foreman, to whom the King, pulling off his hat, said
that what he had done in giving liberty of conscience, was, what was
ever his judgment ought to be done; and that, as he would preserve them
in their enjoyment of it during his reign, so he would endeavor to
settle it by law, that it should never be altered by his successors.After this, he gave them his hand to kiss.It was reported the
subscribers were above 1,000.But this is not so remarkable as an address of the week before (as I was
assured by one present), of some of the FAMILY OF LOVE, His Majesty
asked them what this worship consisted in, and how many their party
might consist of; they told him their custom was to read the Scripture,
and then to preach; but did not give any further account, only said that
for the rest they were a sort of refined Quakers, but their number very
small, not consisting, as they said, of above threescore in all, and
those chiefly belonging to the Isle of Ely.Blathwaite's (two miles from Hampton).This gentleman is Secretary of War, Clerk of the Council, etc., having
raised himself by his industry from very moderate circumstances.He is a
very proper, handsome person, very dexterous in business, and besides
all this, has married a great fortune.His income by the Army, Council,
and Secretary to the Committee of Foreign Plantations, brings him in
above L2,000 per annum.The Privy Seal for L6,000 was passed to me, so that this
tedious affair was dispatched.Hitherto, a very windy and tempestuous
summer.The French sermons to the refugees were continued at Greenwich
Church.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

19th July, 1687.In the way, I dined at Ashted, with
my Lady Mordaunt.I went to see Albury, now purchased by Mr.Finch (the
King's Solicitor and son to the late Lord Chancellor); I found the
garden which I first designed for the Duke of Norfolk, nothing improved.I went to visit Lord Clarendon at Swallowfield, where
was my Lord Cornbury just arrived from Denmark, whither he had
accompanied the Prince of Denmark two months before, and now come back.The miserable tyranny under which that nation lives, he related to us;
the King keeps them under an army of 40,000 men, all Germans, he not
daring to trust his own subjects.Notwithstanding this, the Danes are
exceedingly proud, the country very poor and miserable.Returned home to Sayes Court from Wotton, having been
five weeks absent with my brother and friends, who entertained us very
nobly.God be praised for his goodness, and this refreshment after my
many troubles, and let his mercy and providence ever preserve me.The Lord Mayor sent me an Officer with a staff, to
be one of the Governors of St.PERSECUTION RAGING IN FRANCE; divers churches there fired by lightning,
priests struck, consecrated hosts, etc., burnt and destroyed, both at
St.Malos and Paris, at the grand procession on Corpus Christi day.I went to Lambeth, and dined with the Archbishop.After dinner, I retired into the library, which I found exceedingly
improved; there are also divers rare manuscripts in a room apart.I was godfather to Sir John Chardin's son, christened
at Greenwich Church, named John.The Earl of Bath and Countess of
Carlisle, the other sponsors.An Anabaptist, a very odd ignorant person, a
mechanic, I think, was Lord Mayor.The King and Queen, and Dadi, the
Pope's Nuncio, invited to a feast at Guildhall.A strange turn of
affairs, that those who scandalized the Church of England as favorers of
Popery, should publicly invite an emissary from Rome, one who
represented the very person of their Antichrist!My son was returned out of Devon, where he had been
on a commission from the Lords of the Treasury about a concealment of
land.I went with my Lord Chief-Justice Herbert, to see
his house at Walton-on-Thames: it is a barren place.To a very ordinary
house he had built a very handsome library, designing more building to
it than the place deserves, in my opinion.He desired my advice about
laying out his gardens, etc.The next day, we went to Weybridge, to see
some pictures of the Duchess of Norfolk's, particularly the statue, or
child in gremio, said to be of Michael Angelo; but there are reasons to
think it rather a copy, from some proportion in the figures ill taken.Slingsby, Master of the Mint, being under
very deplorable circumstances on account of his creditors, and
especially the King, I did my endeavor with the Lords of the Treasury to
be favorable to him.My Lord Arran, eldest son to the Duke of Hamilton, being now married to
Lady Ann Spencer, eldest daughter of the Earl of Sunderland, Lord
President of the Council, I and my family had most glorious favors sent
us, the wedding being celebrated with extraordinary splendor.There was a solemn and particular office used at
our, and all the churches of London and ten miles round, for a
thanksgiving to God, for her Majesty being with child.This afternoon I went not to church, being employed
on a religious treatise I had undertaken._Post annum 1588--1660--1688, Annus Mirabilis Tertius._[64]

    [Footnote 64: This seems to have been added after the page was
    written.]Being the Martyrdom day of King Charles I., our
curate made a florid oration against the murder of that excellent
Prince, with an exhortation to obedience from the example of David; 1
Samuel xxvi.[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th February, 1688.My daughter Evelyn going in the coach to visit in
the city, a jolt (the door being not fast shut) flung her quite out in
such manner, as the hind wheels passed over her a little above her
knees.Yet it pleased God, besides the bruises of the wheels, she had no
other harm.In two days she was able to walk, and soon after perfectly
well; through God Almighty's great mercy to an excellent wife and a most
dutiful and discreet daughter-in-law.I received the sad news of my niece Montague's
death at Woodcot on the 15th.I gave in my account about the sick and wounded, in
order to have my quietus.Parker, Bishop of Oxford, who so lately published
his extravagant treatise about transubstantiation, and for abrogating
the test and penal laws, died.He was esteemed a violent, passionate,
haughty man, but yet being pressed to declare for the Church of Rome, he
utterly refused it.The French TYRANT now finding he could make no proselytes among those
Protestants of quality, and others, whom he had caused to be shut up in
dungeons, and confined to nunneries and monasteries, gave them, after so
long trial, a general releasement, and leave to go out of the kingdom,
but utterly taking their estates and their children; so that great
numbers came daily into England and other places, where they were
received and relieved with very considerate Christian charity.This
Providence and goodness of God to those who thus constantly held out,
did so work upon those miserable poor souls who, to avoid the
persecution, signed their renunciation, and to save their estates went
to mass, that reflecting on what they had done, they grew so affected in
their conscience, that not being able to support it, they in great
numbers through all the French provinces, acquainted the magistrates and
lieutenants that being sorry for their apostacy, they were resolved to
return to their old religion; that they would go no more to mass, but
peaceably assemble when they could, to beg pardon and worship God, but
so without weapons as not to give the least umbrage of rebellion or
sedition, imploring their pity and commiseration; and, accordingly,
meeting so from time to time, the dragoon-missioners, Popish officers
and priests, fell upon them, murdered and put them to death, whoever
they could lay hold on; they without the least resistance embraced
death, torture, or hanging, with singing psalms and praying for their
persecutors to the last breath, yet still continuing the former
assembling of themselves in desolate places, suffering with incredible
constancy, that through God's mercy they might obtain pardon for this
lapse.Such examples of Christian behavior have not been seen since the
primitive persecutions; and doubtless God will do some signal work in
the end, if we can with patience and resignation hold out, and depend on
his Providence.I went with Sir Charles Littleton to Sheen, a house
and estate given him by Lord Brounker; one who was ever noted for a
hard, covetous, vicious man; but for his worldly craft and skill in
gaming few exceeded him.Coming to die, he bequeathed all his land,
house, furniture, etc., to Sir Charles, to whom he had no manner of
relation, but an ancient friendship contracted at the famous siege of
Colchester, forty years before.It is a pretty place, with fine gardens,
and well planted, and given to one worthy of them, Sir Charles being an
honest gentleman and soldier.He is brother to Sir Henry Littleton of
Worcestershire, whose great estate he is likely to inherit, his brother
being without children.They are descendants of the great lawyer of that
name, and give the same arms and motto.Temple, formerly maid of honor to the late Queen, a beautiful lady, and
he has many fine children, so that none envy his good fortune.After dinner, we went to see Sir William Temple's near to it; the
most remarkable things are his orangery and gardens, where the
wall-fruit-trees are most exquisitely nailed and trained, far better
than I ever noted.There are many good pictures, especially of Vandyke's, in both these
houses, and some few statues and small busts in the latter.From thence to Kew, to visit Sir Henry Capel's, whose orangery and
_myrtetum_ are most beautiful and perfectly well kept.He was contriving
very high palisadoes of reeds to shade his oranges during the summer,
and painting those reeds in oil.[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st April, 1688.In the morning, the first sermon was by Dr.Paul's (at Whitehall), on Luke x.The
Holy Communion followed, but was so interrupted by the rude breaking in
of multitudes zealous to hear the second sermon, to be preached by the
Bishop of Bath and Wells, that the latter part of that holy office could
hardly be heard, or the sacred elements be distributed without great
trouble.The Princess being come, he preached on Mich.8, 9, 10,
describing the calamity of the Reformed Church of Judah under the
Babylonian persecution, for her sins, and God's delivery of her on her
repentance; that as Judah emerged, so should the now Reformed Church,
whenever insulted and persecuted.He preached with his accustomed
action, zeal, and energy, so that people flocked from all quarters to
hear him.A dry, cold, backward spring; easterly winds.The persecution still raging in France, multitudes of Protestants, and
many very considerable and great persons flying hither, produced a
second general contribution, the <DW7>s, by God's Providence, as yet
making small progress among us.The weather was, till now, so cold and sharp, by an
almost perpetual east wind, which had continued many months, that there
was little appearance of any spring, and yet the winter was very
favorable as to frost and snow.To London, about my petition for allowances upon the
account of Commissioner for Sick and Wounded in the former war with
Holland.His Majesty, alarmed by the great fleet of the Dutch
(while we had a very inconsiderable one), went down to Chatham; their
fleet was well prepared, and out, before we were in any readiness, or
had any considerable number to have encountered them, had there been
occasion, to the great reproach of the nation; while being in profound
peace, there was a mighty land army, which there was no need of, and no
force at sea, where only was the apprehension; but the army was
doubtless kept and increased, in order to bring in and countenance
Popery, the King beginning to discover his intention, by many instances
pursued by the Jesuits, against his first resolution to alter nothing in
the Church Establishment, so that it appeared there can be no reliance
on Popish promises.The King enjoining the ministers to read his
Declaration for giving liberty of conscience (as it was styled) in all
churches of England, this evening, six Bishops, Bath and Wells,[65]
Peterborough,[66] Ely,[67] Chichester,[68] St.Asaph,[69] and
Bristol,[70] in the name of all the rest of the Bishops, came to his
Majesty to petition him, that he would not impose the reading of it to
the several congregations within their dioceses; not that they were
averse to the publishing it for want of due tenderness toward
dissenters, in relation to whom they should be willing to come to such a
temper as should be thought fit, when that matter might be considered
and settled in Parliament and Convocation; but that, the Declaration
being founded on such a dispensing power as might at pleasure set aside
all laws ecclesiastical and civil, it appeared to them illegal, as it
had done to the Parliament in 1661 and 1672, and that it was a point of
such consequence, that they could not so far make themselves parties to
it, as the reading of it in church in time of divine service amounted
to.[Footnote 70: Sir John Trelawny, Bart.]The King was so far incensed at this address, that he with threatening
expressions commanded them to obey him in reading it at their perils,
and so dismissed them.[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th May, 1688.I went to Whitehall Chapel, where, after the morning
lessons, the Declaration was read by one of the choir who used to read
the chapters.I hear it was in the Abbey Church, Westminster, but almost
universally forborne throughout all London: the consequences of which a
little time will show.All the discourse now was about the Bishops refusing to
read the injunction for the abolition of the Test, etc.It seems the
injunction came so crudely from the Secretary's office, that it was
neither sealed nor signed in form, nor had any lawyer been consulted, so
as the Bishops who took all imaginable advice, put the Court to great
difficulties how to proceed against them.Great were the consults, and a
proclamation was expected all this day; but nothing was done.The action
of the Bishops was universally applauded, and reconciled many adverse
parties, <DW7>s only excepted, who were now exceedingly perplexed, and
violent courses were every moment expected.Report was, that the
Protestant secular Lords and Nobility would abet the Clergy.The Queen Dowager, hitherto bent on her return into Portugal, now on the
sudden, on allegation of a great debt owing her by his Majesty disabling
her, declares her resolution to stay.News arrived of the most prodigious earthquake that was almost ever
heard of, subverting the city of Lima and country in Peru, with a
dreadful inundation following it.This day, the Archbishop of Canterbury, with the
Bishops of Ely, Chichester, St.Asaph, Bristol, Peterborough, and Bath
and Wells, were sent from the Privy Council prisoners to the Tower, for
refusing to give bail for their appearance, on their not reading the
Declaration for liberty of conscience; they refused to give bail, as it
would have prejudiced their peerage.The concern of the people for them
was wonderful, infinite crowds on their knees begging their blessing,
and praying for them, as they passed out of the barge along the Tower
wharf.A YOUNG PRINCE born, which will cause disputes.About two o'clock, we heard the Tower ordnance discharged, and the bells
ring for the birth of a Prince of Wales.This was very surprising, it
having been universally given out that her Majesty did not look till the
next month.I went to the Tower to see the Bishops, visited the
Archbishop and the Bishops of Ely, St.Being the first day of term, the Bishops were brought
to Westminster on habeas corpus, when the indictment was read, and they
were called on to plead; their counsel objected that the warrant was
illegal; but, after long debate, it was overruled, and they pleaded.The
Court then offered to take bail for their appearance; but this they
refused, and at last were dismissed on their own recognizances to appear
that day fortnight; the Archbishop in L200, the Bishops in L100 each.Was a day of thanksgiving in London and ten miles about
for the young Prince's birth; a form of prayer made for the purpose by
the Bishop of Rochester.They appeared; the trial lasted from nine in the
morning to past six in the evening, when the jury retired to consider of
their verdict, and the Court adjourned to nine the next morning.The
jury were locked up till that time, eleven of them being for an
acquittal; but one (Arnold, a brewer) would not consent.At length he
agreed with the others.The Chief Justice, Wright, behaved with great
moderation and civility to the Bishops.Alibone, a <DW7>, was strongly
against them; but Holloway and Powell being of opinion in their favor,
they were acquitted.When this was heard, there was great rejoicing; and
there was a lane of people from the King's Bench to the water side, on
their knees, as the Bishops passed and repassed, to beg their blessing.Bonfires were made that night, and bells rung, which was taken very ill
at Court, and an appearance of nearly sixty Earls and Lords, etc., on
the bench, did not a little comfort them; but indeed they were all along
full of comfort and cheerful.Note, they denied to pay the Lieutenant of the Tower (Hales, who used
them very surlily), any fees, alleging that none were due.The night was solemnized with bonfires, and other fireworks, etc.The two judges, Holloway and Powell, were displaced.Godolphin and his brother Sir William to
St.Alban's, to see a library he would have bought of the widow of Dr.Cartwright, late Archdeacon of St.Alban's, a very good collection of
books, especially in divinity; he was to give L300 for them.Having seen
the GREAT CHURCH, now newly repaired by a public contribution, we
returned home.One of the King's chaplains preached before the Princess
on Exodus xiv.13, "Stand still, and behold the salvation of the Lord,"
which he applied so boldly to the present conjuncture of the Church of
England, that more could scarce be said to encourage desponders.The
Popish priests were not able to carry their cause against their learned
adversaries, who confounded them both by their disputes and writings.The camp now began at Hounslow, but the nation was in
high discontent.Colonel Titus, Sir Henry Vane (son of him who was executed for his
treason), and some other of the Presbyterians and Independent party,
were sworn of the Privy Council, from hopes of thereby diverting that
party from going over to the Bishops and Church of England, which now
they began to do, foreseeing the design of the <DW7>s to descend and
take in their most hateful of heretics (as they at other times expressed
them to be) to effect their own ends, now evident; the utter extirpation
of the Church of England first, and then the rest would follow.This night the fireworks were played off, that had been
prepared for the Queen's upsitting.We saw them to great advantage; they
were very fine, and cost some thousands of pounds, in the pyramids,
statues, etc., but were spent too soon for so long a preparation.I went to Lambeth to visit the Archbishop, whom I
found very cheerful.Tenison now told me there would suddenly be some
great thing discovered.This was the Prince of Orange intending to come
over.I went to Althorpe, in Northamptonshire, seventy
miles.A coach and four horses took up me and my son at Whitehall, and
carried us to Dunstable, where we arrived and dined at noon, and from
thence another coach and six horses carried us to Althorpe, four miles
beyond Northampton, where we arrived by seven o'clock that evening.Both
these coaches were hired for me by that noble Countess of Sunderland,
who invited me to her house at Althorpe, where she entertained me and my
son with very extraordinary kindness; I stayed till the Thursday.Jeffryes, the minister of Althorpe, who was my
Lord's chaplain when ambassador in France, preached the shortest
discourse I ever heard; but what was defective in the amplitude of his
sermon, he had supplied in the largeness and convenience of the
parsonage house, which the doctor (who had at least L600 a year in
spiritual advancement) had newly built, and made fit for a person of
quality to live in, with gardens and all accommodation according
therewith.My lady carried us to see Lord Northampton's Seat, a very strong, large
house, built with stone, not altogether modern.They were enlarging the
garden, in which was nothing extraordinary, except the iron gate opening
into the park, which indeed was very good work, wrought in flowers
painted with blue and gilded.There is a noble walk of elms toward the
front of the house by the bowling green.I was not in any room of the
house besides a lobby looking into the garden, where my Lord and his new
Countess (Sir Stephen Fox's daughter, whom I had known from a child)
entertained the Countess and her daughter the Countess of Arran (newly
married to the son of the Duke of Hamilton), with so little good grace,
and so dully, that our visit was very short, and so we returned to
Althorpe, twelve miles distant.[Sidenote: ALTHORPE]

The house, or rather palace, at Althorpe, is a noble uniform pile in
form of a half H, built of brick and freestone, balustered and _a la
moderne_; the hall is well, the staircase excellent; the rooms of state,
galleries, offices and furniture, such as may become a great prince.It
is situated in the midst of a garden, exquisitely planted and kept, and
all this in a park walled in with hewn stone, planted with rows and
walks of trees, canals and fish ponds, and stored with game.And, what
is above all this, governed by a lady, who without any show of
solicitude, keeps everything in such admirable order, both within and
without, from the garret to the cellar, that I do not believe there is
any in this nation, or in any other, that exceeds her in such exact
order, without ostentation, but substantially great and noble.The
meanest servant is lodged so neat and cleanly; the service at the
several tables, the good order and decency--in a word, the entire
economy is perfectly becoming a wise and noble person.She is one who
for her distinguished esteem of me from a long and worthy friendship, I
must ever honor and celebrate.I wish from my soul the Lord, her husband
(whose parts and abilities are otherwise conspicuous), was as worthy of
her, as by a fatal apostasy and court-ambition he has made himself
unworthy!This is what she deplores, and it renders her as much
affliction as a lady of great soul and much prudence is capable of.The
Countess of Bristol, her mother, a grave and honorable lady, has the
comfort of seeing her daughter and grandchildren under the same economy,
especially Mr.Charles Spencer, a youth of extraordinary hopes, very
learned for his age, and ingenious, and under a governor of great worth.Happy were it, could as much be said of the elder brother, the Lord
Spencer, who, rambling about the world, dishonors both his name and his
family, adding sorrow to sorrow to a mother, who has taken all
imaginable care of his education.There is a daughter very young married
to the Earl of Clancarty, who has a great and fair estate in Ireland,
but who yet gives no great presage of worth,--so universally
contaminated is the youth of this corrupt and abandoned age!But this is
again recompensed by my Lord Arran, a sober and worthy gentleman, who
has espoused the Lady Ann Spencer, a young lady of admirable
accomplishments and virtue.I left this noble place and conversation, my lady
having provided carriages to convey us back in the same manner as we
went, and a dinner being prepared at Dunstable against our arrival.Northampton, having been lately burned and re-edified, is now become a
town that for the beauty of the buildings, especially the church and
townhouse, may compare with the neatest in Italy itself.Sprat, Bishop of Rochester, wrote a very honest and handsome letter
to the Commissioners Ecclesiastical, excusing himself from sitting any
longer among them, he by no means approving of their prosecuting the
Clergy who refused to read the Declaration for liberty of conscience, in
prejudice of the Church of England.The Dutch make extraordinary preparations both at sea and land, which
with no small progress Popery makes among us, puts us to many
difficulties.The Popish Irish soldiers commit many murders and insults;
the whole nation disaffected, and in apprehensions.After long trials of the doctors to bring up the little Prince of Wales
by hand (so many of her Majesty's children having died infants) not
succeeding, a country nurse, the wife of a tile maker, is taken to give
it suck.I went to London, where I found the Court in the
utmost consternation on report of the Prince of Orange's landing; which
put Whitehall into so panic a fear, that I could hardly believe it
possible to find such a change.Writs were issued in order to a Parliament, and a declaration to back
the good order of elections, with great professions of maintaining the
Church of England, but without giving any sort of satisfaction to the
people, who showed their high discontent at several things in the
Government.Earthquakes had utterly demolished the ancient Smyrna, and several other
places in Greece, Italy, and even in the Spanish Indies, forerunners of
greater calamities.God Almighty preserve his Church and all who put
themselves under the shadow of his wings, till these things be
overpassed.The Court in so extraordinary a consternation, on
assurance of the Prince of Orange's intention to land, that the writs
sent forth for a Parliament were recalled.[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th October, 1688.16, showing the Scriptures to be our only rule of faith, and its
perfection above all traditions.After which, near 1,000 devout persons
partook of the Communion.The sermon was chiefly occasioned by a Jesuit,
who in the Masshouse on the Sunday before had disparaged the Scripture
and railed at our translation, which some present contradicting, they
pulled him out of the pulpit, and treated him very coarsely, insomuch
that it was like to create a great disturbance in the city.Hourly expectation of the Prince of Orange's invasion heightened to that
degree, that his Majesty thought fit to abrogate the Commission for the
dispensing Power (but retaining his own right still to dispense with all
laws) and restore the ejected Fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford.In
the meantime, he called over 5,000 Irish, and 4,000 Scots, and continued
to remove Protestants and put in <DW7>s at Portsmouth and other places
of trust, and retained the Jesuits about him, increasing the universal
discontent.It brought people to so desperate a pass, that they seemed
passionately to long for and desire the landing of that Prince, whom
they looked on to be their deliverer from Popish tyranny, praying
incessantly for an east wind, which was said to be the only hindrance of
his expedition with a numerous army ready to make a descent.To such a
strange temper, and unheard of in former times, was this poor nation
reduced, and of which I was an eyewitness.The apprehension was (and
with reason) that his Majesty's forces would neither at land nor sea
oppose them with that vigor requisite to repel invaders.The late imprisoned Bishops were now called to reconcile matters, and
the Jesuits hard at work to foment confusion among the Protestants by
their usual tricks.A letter was sent to the Archbishop of
Canterbury,[71] informing him, from good hands, of what was contriving
by them.A paper of what the Bishops advised his Majesty was published.The Bishops were enjoined to prepare a form of prayer against the feared
invasion.The letter was as follows:--

    "My Lord, The honor and reputation which your Grace's piety,
    prudence, and signal courage, have justly merited and obtained, not
    only from the sons of the Church of England, but even universally
    from those Protestants among us who are Dissenters from her
    discipline; God Almighty's Providence and blessing upon your Grace's
    vigilancy and extraordinary endeavors will not suffer to be
    diminished in this conjuncture.The conversation I now and then have
    with some in place who have the opportunity of knowing what is doing
    in the most secret recesses and cabals of our Church's adversaries,
    obliges me to acquaint you, that the calling of your Grace and the
    rest of the Lords Bishops to Court, and what has there of late been
    required of you, is only to create a jealousy and suspicion among
    well-meaning people of such compliances, as it is certain they have
    no cause to apprehend.The plan of this and of all that which is to
    follow of seeming favor thence, is wholly drawn by the Jesuits, who
    are at this time more than ever busy to make divisions among us, all
    other arts and mechanisms having hitherto failed them.They have,
    with other things contrived that your Lordships the Bishops should
    give his Majesty advice separately, without calling any of the rest
    of the Peers, which, though maliciously suggested, spreads generally
    about the town.I do not at all question but your Grace will
    speedily prevent the operation of this venom, and that you will
    think it highly necessary so to do, that your Grace is also enjoined
    to compose a form of prayer, wherein the Prince of Orange is
    expressly to be named the Invader: of this I presume not to say
    anything; but for as much as in all the Declarations, etc., which
    have hitherto been published in pretended favor of the Church of
    England, there is not once the least mention of the REFORMED or
    PROTESTANT RELIGION, but only of the CHURCH OF ENGLAND AS BY LAW
    ESTABLISHED, which Church the <DW7>s tell us is the CHURCH OF ROME,
    which is (say they) the Catholic Church of England--that only is
    established by Law; the Church of England in the REFORMED sense so
    established, is but by an usurped authority.The antiquity of THAT
    would by these words be explained, and utterly defeat this false and
    subdolous construction, and take off all exceptions whatsoever; if,
    in all extraordinary offices, upon these occasions, the words
    REFORMED and PROTESTANT were added to that of the CHURCH OF ENGLAND
    BY LAW ESTABLISHED.And whosoever threatens to invade or come
    against us, to the prejudice of that Church, in God's name, be they
    Dutch or Irish, let us heartily pray and fight against them.My
    Lord, this is, I confess, a bold, but honest period; and, though I
    am well assured that your Grace is perfectly acquainted with all
    this before, and therefore may blame my impertinence, as that does
    [Greek: allotrioepiskopein]; yet I am confident you will not reprove
    the zeal of one who most humbly begs your Grace's pardon, with your
    blessing.(From a copy in Evelyn's
    handwriting.)This day signal for the victory
of William the Conqueror against Harold, near Battel, in Sussex.The
wind, which had been hitherto west, was east all this day.Wonderful
expectation of the Dutch fleet.Public prayers ordered to be read in the
churches against invasion.A tumult in London on the rabble demolishing a
Popish chapel that had been set up in the city.Lady Sunderland acquainted me with his Majesty's
taking away the Seals from Lord Sunderland, and of her being with the
Queen to intercede for him.It is conceived that he had of late grown
remiss in pursuing the interest of the Jesuitical counsels; some
reported one thing, some another; but there was doubtless some secret
betrayed, which time may discover.There was a Council called, to which were summoned the Archbishop of
Canterbury, the Judges, the Lord Mayor, etc.The Queen Dowager, and all
the ladies and lords who were present at the Queen Consort's labor, were
to give their testimony upon oath of the Prince of Wales's birth,
recorded both at the Council Board and at the Chancery a day or two
after.This procedure was censured by some as below his Majesty to
condescend to, on the talk of the people.It was remarkable that on this
occasion the Archbishop, Marquis of Halifax, the Earls of Clarendon and
Nottingham, refused to sit at the Council table among <DW7>s, and their
bold telling his Majesty that whatever was done while such sat among
them was unlawful and incurred _praemunire_;--at least, if what I heard
be true.I dined with Lord Preston, made Secretary of State,
in the place of the Earl of Sunderland.Boyle, when came in the Duke of Hamilton and Earl of
Burlington.The Duke told us many particulars of Mary Queen of Scots,
and her amours with the Italian favorite, etc.My birthday, being the 68th year of my age.O
blessed Lord, grant that as I grow in years, so may I improve in grace!Be thou my protector this following year, and preserve me and mine from
those dangers and great confusions that threaten a sad revolution to
this sinful nation!Defend thy church, our holy religion, and just laws,
disposing his Majesty to listen to sober and healing counsels, that if
it be thy blessed will, we may still enjoy that happy tranquility which
hitherto thou hast continued to us!Dined with Lord Preston, with other company, at Sir
Stephen Fox's.Continual alarms of the Prince of Orange, but no
certainty.Reports of his great losses of horse in the storm, but
without any assurance.A man was taken with divers papers and printed
manifestoes, and carried to Newgate, after examination at the Cabinet
Council.There was likewise a declaration of the States for satisfaction
of all public ministers at The Hague, except to the English and the
French.There was in that of the Prince's an expression, as if the Lords
both spiritual and temporal had invited him over, with a deduction of
the causes of his enterprise.This made his Majesty convene my Lord of
Canterbury and the other Bishops now in town, to give an account of what
was in the manifesto, and to enjoin them to clear themselves by some
public writing of this disloyal charge.It was now certainly reported by some who saw the
fleet, and the Prince embark, that they sailed from the Brill on
Wednesday morning, and that the Princess of Orange was there to take
leave of her husband.Fresh reports of the Prince being landed somewhere
about Portsmouth, or the Isle of Wight, whereas it was thought it would
have been northward.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1688.I went to London; heard the news of the Prince
having landed at Torbay, coming with a fleet of near 700 sail, passing
through the Channel with so favorable a wind, that our navy could not
intercept, or molest them.This put the King and Court into great
consternation, they were now employed in forming an army to stop their
further progress, for they were got into Exeter, and the season and ways
very improper for his Majesty's forces to march so great a distance.The Archbishop of Canterbury and some few of the other Bishops and
Lords in London, were sent for to Whitehall, and required to set forth
their abhorrence of this invasion.They assured his Majesty that they
had never invited any of the Prince's party, or were in the least privy
to it, and would be ready to show all testimony of their loyalty; but,
as to a public declaration, being so few, they desired that his Majesty
would call the rest of their brethren and Peers, that they might consult
what was fit to be done on this occasion, not thinking it right to
publish anything without them, and till they had themselves seen the
Prince's manifesto, in which it was pretended he was invited in by the
Lords, spiritual and temporal.This did not please the King; so they
departed.A declaration was published, prohibiting all persons to see or read the
Prince's manifesto, in which was set forth at large the cause of his
expedition, as there had been one before from the States.These are the beginnings of sorrow, unless God in his mercy prevent it
by some happy reconciliation of all dissensions among us.This, in all
likelihood, nothing can effect except a free Parliament; but this we
cannot hope to see, while there are any forces on either side.I pray
God to protect and direct the King for the best and truest interest of
his people!--I saw his Majesty touch for the evil, Piten the Jesuit, and
Warner officiating.Lord Cornbury carries some regiments, and marches to
Honiton, the Prince's headquarters.The city of London in disorder; the
rabble pulled down the nunnery newly bought by the <DW7>s of Lord
Berkeley, at St.The Queen prepares to go to Portsmouth for
safety, to attend the issue of this commotion, which has a dreadful
aspect.The King goes to
Salisbury to rendezvous the army, and return to London.Lord Delamere
appears for the Prince in Cheshire.The
Archbishop of Canterbury and some Bishops, and such Peers as were in
London, address his Majesty to call a Parliament.The King invites all
foreign nations to come over.The French take all the Palatinate, and
alarm the Germans more than ever.We adjourned the
election of a President to 23d of April, by reason of the public
commotions, yet dined together as of custom this day.Afterward, visited my Lord Godolphin, then going with the Marquis of
Halifax and Earl of Nottingham as Commissioners to the Prince of Orange;
he told me they had little power.Bath, York, Hull, Bristol, and all the eminent nobility and persons of
quality through England, declare for the Protestant religion and laws,
and go to meet the Prince, who every day sets forth new Declarations
against the <DW7>s.The great favorites at Court, Priests and Jesuits,
fly or abscond.Everything, till now concealed, flies abroad in public
print, and is cried about the streets.Expectation of the Prince coming
to Oxford.The Prince of Wales and great treasure sent privily to
Portsmouth, the Earl of Dover being Governor.Address from the Fleet not
grateful to his Majesty.The <DW7>s in offices lay down their
commissions, and fly.Universal consternation among them; it looks like
a revolution.The rabble
demolished all Popish chapels, and several <DW7> lords and gentlemen's
houses, especially that of the Spanish Ambassador, which they pillaged,
and burned his library.The King flies to sea, puts in at Faversham for
ballast; is rudely treated by the people; comes back to Whitehall.The Prince of Orange is advanced to Windsor, is invited by the King to
St.James's, the messenger sent was the Earl of Faversham, the General
of the Forces, who going without trumpet, or passport, is detained
prisoner by the Prince, who accepts the invitation, but requires his
Majesty to retire to some distant place, that his own guards may be
quartered about the palace and city.This is taken heinously and the
King goes privately to Rochester; is persuaded to come back; comes on
the Sunday; goes to mass, and dines in public, a Jesuit saying grace (I
was present).That night was a Council; his Majesty refuses to
assent to all the proposals; goes away again to Rochester.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th December, 1688.I saw the King take barge to Gravesend at twelve
o'clock--a sad sight!James's, and fills
Whitehall with Dutch guards.A Council of Peers meet about an expedient
to call a Parliament; adjourn to the House of Lords.The Chancellor,
Earl of Peterborough, and divers others taken.The Earl of Sunderland
flies; Sir Edward Hale, Walker, and others, taken and secured.All the world go to see the Prince at St.James's, where there is a
great Court.There I saw him, and several of my acquaintance who came
over with him.He is very stately, serious and reserved.The English
soldiers sent out of town to disband them; not well pleased.The King passes into France, whither the Queen and
child were gone a few days before.The Peers and such Commoners as were members of the
Parliament at Oxford, being the last of Charles II.meeting, desire the
Prince of Orange to take on him the disposal of the public revenue till
a convention of Lords and Commons should meet in full body, appointed by
his circular letters to the shires and boroughs, 22d of January.I had
now quartered upon me a Lieutenant-Colonel and eight horses.This day prayers for the Prince of Wales were first
left off in our Church.A long frost and deep snow; the Thames almost
frozen over.I visited the Archbishop of Canterbury, where I
found the Bishops of St.Asaph, Ely, Bath and Wells, Peterborough, and
Chichester, the Earls of Aylesbury and Clarendon, Sir George Mackenzie,
Lord-Advocate of Scotland, and then came in a Scotch Archbishop, etc.After prayers and dinner, divers serious matters were discoursed,
concerning the present state of the Public, and sorry I was to find
there was as yet no accord in the judgments of those of the Lords and
Commons who were to convene; some would have the Princess made Queen
without any more dispute, others were for a Regency; there was a Tory
party (then so called), who were for inviting his Majesty again upon
conditions; and there were Republicans who would make the Prince of
Orange like a Stadtholder.The Romanists were busy among these several
parties to bring them into confusion: most for ambition or other
interest, few for conscience and moderate resolutions.I found nothing
of all this in this assembly of Bishops, who were pleased to admit me
into their discourses; they were all for a Regency, thereby to salve
their oaths, and so all public matters to proceed in his Majesty's name,
by that to facilitate the calling of Parliament, according to the laws
in being.My Lord of Canterbury gave me great thanks for the advertisement I sent
him in October, and assured me they took my counsel in that particular,
and that it came very seasonably.I found by the Lord-Advocate that the Bishops of Scotland (who were
indeed little worthy of that character, and had done much mischief in
that Church) were now coming about to the true interest, in this
conjuncture which threatened to abolish the whole hierarchy in that
kingdom; and therefore the Scottish Archbishop and Lord-Advocate
requested the Archbishop of Canterbury to use his best endeavors with
the Prince to maintain the Church there in the same state, as by law at
present settled.It now growing late, after some private discourse with his Grace, I took
my leave, most of the Lords being gone.The great convention being assembled the day before, falling upon the
question about the government, resolved that King James having by the
advice of the Jesuits and other wicked persons endeavored to subvert the
laws of the Church and State, and deserted the kingdom, carrying away
the seals, etc., without any care for the management of the government,
had by demise abdicated himself and wholly vacated his right; they did
therefore desire the Lords' concurrence to their vote, to place the
crown on the next heir, the Prince of Orange, for his life, then to the
Princess, his wife, and if she died without issue, to the Princess of
Denmark, and she failing, to the heirs of the Prince, excluding forever
all possibility of admitting a Roman Catholic.[Sidenote: LONDON]

27th January, 1689.I dined at the Admiralty, where was brought in a
child not twelve years old, the son of one Dr.Clench, of the most
prodigious maturity of knowledge, for I cannot call it altogether
memory, but something more extraordinary.Pepys and myself examined
him, not in any method, but with promiscuous questions, which required
judgment and discernment to answer so readily and pertinently.There was
not anything in chronology, history, geography, the several systems of
astronomy, courses of the stars, longitude, latitude, doctrine of the
spheres, courses and sources of rivers, creeks, harbors, eminent cities,
boundaries and bearings of countries, not only in Europe, but in any
other part of the earth, which he did not readily resolve and
demonstrate his knowledge of, readily drawing out with a pen anything he
would describe.He was able not only to repeat the most famous things
which are left us in any of the Greek or Roman histories, monarchies,
republics, wars, colonies, exploits by sea and land, but all the sacred
stories of the Old and New Testament; the succession of all the
monarchies, Babylonian, Persian, Greek, Roman, with all the lower
Emperors, Popes, Heresiarchs, and Councils, what they were called about,
what they determined, or in the controversy about Easter, the tenets of
the Gnostics, Sabellians, Arians, Nestorians; the difference between St.Cyprian and Stephen about re-baptism, the schisms.We leaped from that
to other things totally different, to Olympic years, and synchronisms;
we asked him questions which could not be resolved without considerable
meditation and judgment, nay of some particulars of the Civil Laws, of
the Digest and Code.He gave a stupendous account of both natural and
moral philosophy, and even in metaphysics.Having thus exhausted ourselves rather than this wonderful child, or
angel rather, for he was as beautiful and lovely in countenance as in
knowledge, we concluded with asking him if, in all he had read or heard
of, he had ever met with anything which was like this expedition of the
Prince of Orange, with so small a force to obtain three great kingdoms
without any contest.After a little thought, he told us that he knew of
nothing which did more resemble it than the coming of Constantine the
Great out of Britain, through France and Italy, so tedious a march, to
meet Maxentius, whom he overthrew at Pons Milvius with very little
conflict, and at the very gates of Rome, which he entered and was
received with triumph, and obtained the empire, not of three kingdoms
only, but of all the then known world.He was perfect in the Latin
authors, spoke French naturally, and gave us a description of France,
Italy, Savoy, Spain, ancient and modernly divided; as also of ancient
Greece, Scythia, and northern countries and tracts: we left questioning
further.He did this without any set or formal repetitions, as one who
had learned things without book, but as if he minded other things, going
about the room, and toying with a parrot there, and as he was at dinner
(_tanquam aliua agens_, as it were) seeming to be full of play, of a
lively, sprightly temper, always smiling, and exceedingly pleasant,
without the least levity, rudeness, or childishness.His father assured us he never imposed anything to charge his memory by
causing him to get things by heart, not even the rules of grammar; but
his tutor (who was a Frenchman) read to him, first in French, then in
Latin; that he usually played among other boys four or five hours every
day, and that he was as earnest at his play as at his study.He was
perfect in arithmetic, and now newly entered into Greek.In sum
(_horresco referens_), I had read of divers forward and precocious
youths, and some I have known, but I never did either hear or read of
anything like to this sweet child, if it be right to call him child who
has more knowledge than most men in the world.I counseled his father
not to set his heart too much on this jewel,

    "_Immodicis brevis est aetas, et rara senectus,_"

as I myself learned by sad experience in my most dear child Richard,
many years since, who, dying before he was six years old, was both in
shape and countenance and pregnancy of learning, next to a prodigy.The votes of the House of Commons being carried up
by Mr.Hampden, their chairman, to the Lords, I got a station by the
Prince's lodgings at the door of the lobby to the House, and heard much
of the debate, which lasted very long.Lord Derby was in the chair (for
the House was resolved into a grand committee of the whole House); after
all had spoken, it came to the question, which was carried by three
voices against a Regency, which 51 were for, 54 against; the minority
alleging the danger of dethroning Kings, and scrupling many passages and
expressions in the vote of the Commons, too long to set down
particularly.Some were for sending to his Majesty with conditions:
others that the King could do no wrong, and that the maladministration
was chargeable on his ministers.There were not more than eight or nine
bishops, and but two against the Regency; the archbishop was absent, and
the clergy now began to change their note, both in pulpit and discourse,
on their old passive obedience, so as people began to talk of the
bishops being cast out of the House.In short, things tended to
dissatisfaction on both sides; add to this, the morose temper of the
Prince of Orange, who showed little countenance to the noblemen and
others, who expected a more gracious and cheerful reception when they
made their court.The English army also was not so in order, and firm to
his interest, nor so weakened but that it might give interruption.Ireland was in an ill posture as well as Scotland.Nothing was yet done
toward a settlement.God of his infinite mercy compose these things,
that we may be at last a Nation and a Church under some fixed and sober
establishment!'s MARTYRDOM; but
in all the public offices and pulpit prayers, the collects, and litany
for the King and Queen were curtailed and mutilated.Sharp preached
before the Commons, but was disliked, and not thanked for his sermon.At our church (the next day being appointed a
thanksgiving for deliverance by the Prince of Orange, with prayers
purposely composed), our lecturer preached in the afternoon a very
honest sermon, showing our duty to God for the many signal deliverances
of our Church, without touching on politics.The King's coronation day was ordered not to be
observed, as hitherto it had been.The Convention of the Lords and Commons now declare the Prince and
Princess of Orange King and Queen of England, France, and Ireland
(Scotland being an independent kingdom), the Prince and Princess being
to enjoy it jointly during their lives; but the executive authority to
be vested in the Prince during life, though all proceedings to run in
both names, and that it should descend to their issue, and for want of
such, to the Princess Anne of Denmark and her issue, and in want of
such, to the heirs of the body of the Prince, if he survive, and that
failing, to devolve to the Parliament, as they should think fit.These
produced a conference with the Lords, when also there was presented
heads of such new laws as were to be enacted.It is thought on these
conditions they will be proclaimed.There was much contest about the King's abdication, and whether he had
vacated the government.The Earl of Nottingham and about twenty Lords,
and many Bishops, entered their protests, but the concurrence was great
against them.Forces sending to Ireland, that kingdom
being in great danger by the Earl of Tyrconnel's army, and expectations
from France coming to assist them, but that King was busy in invading
Flanders, and encountering the German Princes.It is likely that this
will be the most remarkable summer for action, which has happened in
many years.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st February, 1689.James's on the
obligation to walk worthy of God's particular and signal deliverance of
the nation and church.I saw the NEW QUEEN and KING proclaimed the very next day after her
coming to Whitehall, Wednesday, 13th February, with great acclamation
and general good reception.It was believed
that both, especially the Princess, would have shown some (seeming)
reluctance at least, of assuming her father's crown, and made some
apology, testifying by her regret that he should by his mismanagement
necessitate the nation to so extraordinary a proceeding, which would
have shown very handsomely to the world, and according to the character
given of her piety; consonant also to her husband's first declaration,
that there was no intention of deposing the King, but of succoring the
nation; but nothing of all this appeared; she came into Whitehall
laughing and jolly, as to a wedding, so as to seem quite transported.She rose early the next morning, and in her undress, as it was reported,
before her women were up, went about from room to room to see the
convenience of Whitehall; lay in the same bed and apartment where the
late Queen lay, and within a night or two sat down to play at basset, as
the Queen, her predecessor used to do.She smiled upon and talked to
everybody, so that no change seemed to have taken place at Court since
her last going away, save that infinite crowds of people thronged to see
her, and that she went to our prayers.She seems to be of a good nature, and that she takes nothing to
heart: while the Prince, her husband, has a thoughtful countenance, is
wonderfully serious and silent, and seems to treat all persons alike
gravely, and to be very intent on affairs: Holland, Ireland, and France
calling for his care.Divers Bishops and Noblemen are not at all satisfied with this so sudden
assumption of the Crown, without any previous sending, and offering some
conditions to the absent King; or on his not returning, or not assenting
to those conditions, to have proclaimed him Regent; but the major part
of both Houses prevailed to make them King and Queen immediately, and a
crown was tempting.This was opposed and spoken against with such
vehemence by Lord Clarendon (her own uncle), that it put him by all
preferment, which must doubtless have been as great as could have been
given him.My Lord of Rochester, his brother, overshot himself, by the
same carriage and stiffness, which their friends thought they might have
well spared when they saw how it was like to be overruled, and that it
had been sufficient to have declared their dissent with less passion,
acquiescing in due time.The Archbishop of Canterbury and some of the rest, on scruple of
conscience and to salve the oaths they had taken, entered their protests
and hung off, especially the Archbishop, who had not all this while so
much as appeared out of Lambeth.This occasioned the wonder of many who
observed with what zeal they contributed to the Prince's expedition, and
all the while also rejecting any proposals of sending again to the
absent King; that they should now raise scruples, and such as created
much division among the people, greatly rejoicing the old courtiers, and
especially the <DW7>s.Another objection was, the invalidity of what was done by a convention
only, and the as yet unabrogated laws; this drew them to make themselves
on the 22d [February] a Parliament, the new King passing the act with
the crown on his head.The lawyers disputed, but necessity prevailed,
the government requiring a speedy settlement.Innumerable were the crowds, who solicited for, and expected offices;
most of the old ones were turned out.Two or three white staves were
disposed of some days before, as Lord Steward, to the Earl of
Devonshire; Treasurer of the household, to Lord Newport; Lord
Chamberlain to the King, to my Lord of Dorset; but there were as yet
none in offices of the civil government save the Marquis of Halifax as
Privy Seal.A council of thirty was chosen, Lord Derby president, but
neither Chancellor nor Judges were yet declared, the new Great Seal not
yet finished.Tillotson, Dean of Canterbury, made an excellent
discourse on Matt.44, exhorting to charity and forgiveness of
enemies; I suppose purposely, the new Parliament being furious about
impeaching those who were obnoxious, and as their custom has ever been,
going on violently, without reserve, or modification, while wise men
were of opinion the most notorious offenders being named and excepted,
an Act of Amnesty would be more seasonable, to pacify the minds of men
in so general a discontent of the nation, especially of those who did
not expect to see the government assumed without any regard to the
absent King, or proving a spontaneous abdication, or that the birth of
the Prince of Wales was an imposture; five of the Bishops also still
refusing to take the new oath.In the meantime, to gratify the people, the hearth-tax was remitted
forever; but what was intended to supply it, besides present great taxes
on land, is not named.The King abroad was now furnished by the French King with money and
officers for an expedition to Ireland.The great neglect in not more
timely preventing that from hence, and the disturbances in Scotland,
give apprehensions of great difficulties, before any settlement can be
perfected here, while the Parliament dispose of the great offices among
themselves.The Great Seal, Treasury and Admiralty put into commission
of many unexpected persons, to gratify the more; so that by the present
appearance of things (unless God Almighty graciously interpose and give
success in Ireland and settle Scotland) more trouble seems to threaten
the nation than could be expected.In the interim, the new King refers
all to the Parliament in the most popular manner, but is very slow in
providing against all these menaces, besides finding difficulties in
raising men to send abroad; the former army, which had never seen any
service hitherto, receiving their pay and passing their summer in an
idle scene of a camp at Hounslow, unwilling to engage, and many
disaffected, and scarce to be trusted.[Sidenote: LONDON]

29th March, 1689.The new King much blamed for neglecting Ireland, now
likely to be ruined by the Lord Tyrconnel and his Popish party, too
strong for the Protestants.Wonderful uncertainty where King James was,
whether in France or Ireland.The Scots seem as yet to favor King
William, rejecting King James's letter to them, yet declaring nothing
positively.Parliament preparing the
coronation oath.Presbyterians and Dissenters displeased at the vote for
preserving the Protestant religion as established by law, without
mentioning what they were to have as to indulgence.The Archbishop of Canterbury and four other Bishops refusing to come to
Parliament, it was deliberated whether they should incur _Praemunire_;
but it was thought fit to let this fall, and be connived at, for fear of
the people, to whom these Prelates were very dear, for the opposition
they had given to Popery.Things far from settled as was expected, by reason of
the slothful, sickly temper of the new King, and the Parliament's
unmindfulness of Ireland, which is likely to prove a sad omission.The Confederates beat the French out of the Palatinate, which they had
most barbarously ruined.I saw the procession to and from the Abbey Church of
Westminster, with the great feast in Westminster Hall, at the coronation
of King William and Queen Mary.What was different from former
coronations, was some alteration in the coronation oath.Burnet, now
made Bishop of Sarum, preached with great applause.The Parliament men
had scaffolds and places which took up the one whole side of the Hall.When the King and Queen had dined, the ceremony of the Champion, and
other services by tenure were performed.The Parliament men were feasted
in the Exchequer chamber, and had each of them a gold medal given them,
worth five-and-forty shillings.On the one side were the effigies of the
King and Queen inclining one to the other; on the reverse was Jupiter
throwing a bolt at Phaeton the words, "_Ne totus absumatur_": which was
but dull, seeing they might have had out of the poet something as
apposite.Much of the splendor of the proceeding was abated by the absence of
divers who should have contributed to it, there being but five Bishops,
four Judges (no more being yet sworn), and several noblemen and great
ladies wanting; the feast, however, was magnificent.The next day the
House of Commons went and kissed their new Majesties' hands in the
Banqueting House.Asaph to visit my Lord
of Canterbury at Lambeth, who had excused himself from officiating at
the coronation, which was performed by the Bishop of London, assisted by
the Archbishop of York.We had much private and free discourse with his
Grace concerning several things relating to the Church, there being now
a bill of comprehension to be brought from the Lords to the Commons.I
urged that when they went about to reform some particulars in the
Liturgy, Church discipline, Canons, etc., the baptizing in private
houses without necessity might be reformed, as likewise so frequent
burials in churches; the one proceeding much from the pride of women,
bringing that into custom which was only indulged in case of imminent
danger, and out of necessity during the rebellion, and persecution of
the clergy in our late civil wars; the other from the avarice of
ministers, who, in some opulent parishes, made almost as much of
permission to bury in the chancel and the church, as of their livings,
and were paid with considerable advantage and gifts for baptizing in
chambers.To this they heartily assented, and promised their endeavor to
get it reformed, utterly disliking both practices as novel and indecent.We discoursed likewise of the great disturbance and prejudice it might
cause, should the new oath, now on the anvil, be imposed on any, save
such as were in new office, without any retrospect to such as either had
no office, or had been long in office, who it was likely would have some
scruples about taking a new oath, having already sworn fidelity to the
government as established by law.This we all knew to be the case of my
Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, and some other persons who were not so
fully satisfied with the Convention making it an abdication of King
James, to whom they had sworn allegiance.King James was now certainly in Ireland with the Marshal d'Estrades,
whom he made a Privy Councillor; and who caused the King to remove the
Protestant Councillors, some whereof, it seems, had continued to sit,
telling him that the King of France, his master, would never assist him
if he did not immediately do it; by which it is apparent how the poor
Prince is managed by the French.Scotland declares for King William and Queen Mary, with the reasons of
their setting aside King James, not as abdicating, but forfeiting his
right by maladministration; they proceeded with much more caution and
prudence than we did, who precipitated all things to the great reproach
of the nation, all which had been managed by some crafty, ill-principled
men.The new Privy Council have a Republican spirit, manifestly
undermining all future succession of the Crown and prosperity of the
Church of England, which yet I hope they will not be able to accomplish
so soon as they expect, though they get into all places of trust and
profit.This was one of the most seasonable springs, free from
the usual sharp east winds that I have observed since the year 1660 (the
year of the Restoration), which was much such an one.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th April, 1689.I heard the lawyers plead before the Lords the writ
of error in the judgment of Oates, as to the charge against him of
perjury, which after debate they referred to the answer of Holloway,
etc., who were his judges.Asaph to
the Archbishop at Lambeth, where they entered into discourse concerning
the final destruction of Antichrist, both concluding that the third
trumpet and vial were now pouring out.Asaph considered the
killing of the two witnesses, to be the utter destruction of the
Cevennes Protestants by the French and Duke of Savoy, and the other the
Waldenses and Pyrenean Christians, who by all appearance from good
history had kept the primitive faith from the very Apostles' time till
now.The doubt his Grace suggested was, whether it could be made evident
that the present persecution had made so great a havoc of those faithful
people as of the other, and whether there were not yet some among them
in being who met together, it being stated from the text, Apoc.xi.,
that they should both be slain together.Mede's way of interpretation, and that he only failed in resolving too
hastily on the King of Sweden's (Gustavus Adolphus) success in Germany.They agreed that it would be good to employ some intelligent French
minister to travel as far as the Pyrenees to understand the present
state of the Church there, it being a country where hardly anyone
travels.There now came certain news that King James had not only landed in
Ireland, but that he had surprised Londonderry, and was become master of
that kingdom, to the great shame of our government, who had been so
often solicited to provide against it by timely succor, and which they
might so easily have done.This is a terrible beginning of more
troubles, especially should an army come thence into Scotland, people
being generally disaffected here and everywhere else, so that the seamen
and landmen would scarce serve without compulsion.A new oath was now fabricating for all the clergy to take, of obedience
to the present Government, in abrogation of the former oaths of
allegiance, which it is foreseen many of the bishops and others of the
clergy will not take.The penalty is to be the loss of their dignity and
spiritual preferment.This is thought to have been driven on by the
Presbyterians, our new governors.God in mercy send us help, and direct
the counsels to his glory and good of his Church!Public matters went very ill in Ireland: confusion and dissensions among
ourselves, stupidity, inconstancy, emulation, the governors employing
unskillful men in greatest offices, no person of public spirit and
ability appearing,--threaten us with a very sad prospect of what may be
the conclusion, without God's infinite mercy.A fight by Admiral Herbert with the French, he imprudently setting on
them in a creek as they were landing men in Ireland, by which we came
off with great slaughter and little honor--so strangely negligent and
remiss were we in preparing a timely and sufficient fleet.The Scots
Commissioners offer the crown to the NEW KING AND QUEEN on
conditions.--Act of Poll-money came forth, sparing none.--Now appeared
the Act of Indulgence for the Dissenters, but not exempting them from
paying dues to the Church of England clergy, or serving in office
according to law, with several other clauses.--A most splendid embassy
from Holland to congratulate the King and Queen on their accession to
the crown.A solemn fast for success of the fleet, etc.I dined with the Bishop of Asaph; Monsieur Capellus, the
learned son of the most learned Ludovicus, presented to him his father's
works, not published till now.I visited the Archbishop of Canterbury, and stayed with
him till about seven o'clock.He read to me the Pope's excommunication
of the French King.Burnet, now Bishop of Sarum; got him to let
Mr.King James's declaration was now dispersed, offering
pardon to all, if on his landing, or within twenty days after, they
should return to their obedience.Our fleet not yet at sea, through some prodigious sloth, and men minding
only their present interest; the French riding masters at sea, taking
many great prizes to our wonderful reproach.No certain news from
Ireland; various reports of Scotland; discontents at home.The King of
Denmark at last joins with the Confederates, and the two Northern Powers
are reconciled.The East India Company likely to be dissolved by
Parliament for many arbitrary actions.Oates acquitted of perjury, to
all honest men's admiration.News of A PLOT discovered, on which divers were sent to
the Tower and secured.An extraordinary drought, to the threatening of great
wants as to the fruits of the earth.Pepys,
late Secretary to the Admiralty, holding my "Sylva" in my right hand.It
was on his long and earnest request, and is placed in his library.Kneller never painted in a more masterly manner.I dined at Lord Clarendon's, it being his lady's
wedding day, when about three in the afternoon there was an unusual and
violent storm of thunder, rain, and wind; many boats on the Thames were
overwhelmed, and such was the impetuosity of the wind as to carry up the
waves in pillars and spouts most dreadful to behold, rooting up trees
and ruining some houses.The Countess of Sunderland afterward told me
that it extended as far as Althorpe at the very time, which is seventy
miles from London.It did no harm at Deptford, but at Greenwich it did
much mischief.I went to Hampton Court about business, the Council
being there.A great apartment and spacious garden with fountains was
beginning in the park at the head of the canal.The Marshal de Schomberg went now as General toward
Ireland, to the relief of Londonderry.The
Confederates passing the Rhine, besiege Bonn and Mayence, to obtain a
passage into France.A great victory gotten by the Muscovites, taking
and burning Perecop.A new rebel against the Turks threatens the
destruction of that tyranny.All Europe in arms against France, and
hardly to be found in history so universal a face of war.The Convention (or Parliament as some called it) sitting, exempt the
Duke of Hanover from the succession to the crown, which they seem to
confine to the present new King, his wife, and Princess Anne of Denmark,
who is so monstrously swollen, that it is doubted whether her being
thought with child may prove a TYMPANY only, so that the unhappy family
of the Stuarts seems to be extinguishing; and then what government is
likely to be next set up is unknown, whether regal and by election, or
otherwise, the Republicans and Dissenters from the Church of England
evidently looking that way.The Scots have now again voted down Episcopacy there.Great discontents
through this nation at the slow proceedings of the King, and the
incompetent instruments and officers he advances to the greatest and
most necessary charges.Hitherto it has been a most seasonable summer.Londonderry relieved after a brave and wonderful holding out.I went to visit the Archbishop of Canterbury since
his suspension, and was received with great kindness.A dreadful fire
happened in Southwark.Came to visit us the Marquis de Ruvigne, and one
Monsieur le Coque, a French refugee, who left great riches for his
religion; a very learned, civil person; he married the sister of the
Duchess de la Force.Ottobone, a Venetian Cardinal, eighty years old,
made Pope.[72]

    [Footnote 72: Peter Otthobonus succeeded Innocent XI.as Pope in
    1689, by the title of Alexander VIII.]My birthday, being now sixty-nine years old.Blessed
Father, who hast prolonged my years to this great age, and given me to
see so great and wonderful revolutions, and preserved me amid them to
this moment, accept, I beseech thee, the continuance of my prayers and
thankful acknowledgments, and grant me grace to be working out my
salvation and redeeming the time, that thou mayst be glorified by me
here, and my immortal soul saved whenever thou shalt call for it, to
perpetuate thy praises to all eternity, in that heavenly kingdom where
there are no more changes or vicissitudes, but rest, and peace, and joy,
and consummate felicity, forever.Grant this, O heavenly Father, for the
sake of Jesus thine only Son and our Savior.Asaph, Lord Almoner, preached
before the King and Queen, the whole discourse being an historical
narrative of the Church of England's several deliverances, especially
that of this anniversary, signalized by being also the birthday of the
Prince of Orange, his marriage (which was on the 4th), and his landing
at Torbay this day.There was a splendid ball and other rejoicings.After a very wet season, the winter came on
severely.Much wet, without frost, yet the wind north and
easterly.A Convocation of the Clergy meet about a reformation of our
Liturgy, Canons, etc., obstructed by others of the clergy.[Sidenote: LONDON]

27th November, 1689.I went to London with my family, to winter at Soho,
in the great square.This night there was a most extraordinary storm
of wind, accompanied with snow and sharp weather; it did great harm in
many places, blowing down houses, trees, etc., killing many people.It
began about two in the morning, and lasted till five, being a kind of
hurricane, which mariners observe have begun of late years to come
northward.This winter has been hitherto extremely wet, warm, and windy.Ann's Church an exhortatory
letter to the clergy of London from the Bishop, together with a Brief
for relieving the distressed Protestants, and Vaudois, who fled from the
persecution of the French and Duke of Savoy, to the Protestant Cantons
of Switzerland.The Parliament was unexpectedly prorogued to 2d of April to the
discontent and surprise of many members who, being exceedingly averse to
the settling of anything, proceeding with animosities, multiplying
exceptions against those whom they pronounced obnoxious, and producing
as universal a discontent against King William and themselves, as there
was before against King James.The new King resolved on an expedition
into Ireland in person.About 150 of the members who were of the more
royal party, meeting at a feast at the Apollo Tavern near St.Dunstan's,
sent some of their company to the King, to assure him of their service;
he returned his thanks, advising them to repair to their several
counties and preserve the peace during his absence, and assuring them
that he would be steady to his resolution of defending the Laws and
Religion established.The great Lord suspected to have counselled this
prorogation, universally denied it.However, it was believed the chief
adviser was the Marquis of Carmarthen, who now seemed to be most in
favor.The Parliament was dissolved by proclamation, and
another called to meet the 20th of March.This was a second surprise to
the former members; and now the Court party, or, as they call
themselves, Church of England, are making their interests in the
country.The Marquis of Halifax lays down his office of Privy Seal, and
pretends to retire.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th February, 1690.The Duchess of Monmouth's chaplain preached at St.Martin's an excellent discourse exhorting to peace and sanctity, it
being now the time of very great division and dissension in the nation;
first, among the Churchmen, of whom the moderate and sober part were for
a speedy reformation of divers things, which it was thought might be
made in our Liturgy, for the inviting of Dissenters; others more stiff
and rigid, were for no condescension at all.Books and pamphlets were
published every day pro and con; the Convocation were forced for the
present to suspend any further progress.There was fierce and great
carousing about being elected in the new Parliament.The King persists
in his intention of going in person for Ireland, whither the French are
sending supplies to King James, and we, the Danish horse to Schomberg.I dined with the Marquis of Carmarthen (late Lord
Danby), where was Lieutenant-General Douglas, a very considerate and
sober commander, going for Ireland.He related to us the exceeding
neglect of the English soldiers, suffering severely for want of clothes
and necessaries this winter, exceedingly magnifying their courage and
bravery during all their hardships.There dined also Lord Lucas,
Lieutenant of the Tower, and the Bishop of St.The Privy Seal was
again put in commission, Mr.Cheny (who married my kinswoman, Mrs.Pierrepoint), Sir Thomas Knatchbull, and Sir P. W. Pultney.The
imprudence of both sexes was now become so great and universal, persons
of all ranks keeping their courtesans publicly, that the King had lately
directed a letter to the Bishops to order their clergy to preach against
that sin, swearing, etc., and to put the ecclesiastical laws in
execution without any indulgence.I went to Kensington, which King William had bought
of Lord Nottingham, and altered, but was yet a patched building, but
with the garden, however, it is a very sweet villa, having to it the
park and a straight new way through this park.Pepys, late Secretary to the
Admiralty, where was that excellent shipwright and seaman (for so he had
been, and also a Commission of the Navy), Sir Anthony Deane.Among other
discourse, and deploring the sad condition of our navy, as now governed
by inexperienced men since this Revolution, he mentioned what exceeding
advantage we of this nation had by being the first who built frigates,
the first of which ever built was that vessel which was afterward called
"The Constant Warwick," and was the work of Pett of Chatham, for a trial
of making a vessel that would sail swiftly; it was built with low decks,
the guns lying near the water, and was so light and swift of sailing,
that in a short time he told us she had, ere the Dutch war was ended,
taken as much money from privateers as would have laden her; and that
more such being built, did in a year or two scour the Channel from those
of Dunkirk and others which had exceedingly infested it.He added that
it would be the best and only infallible expedient to be masters of the
sea, and able to destroy the greatest navy of any enemy if, instead of
building huge great ships and second and third rates, they would leave
off building such high decks, which were for nothing but to gratify
gentlemen-commanders, who must have all their effeminate accommodations,
and for pomp; that it would be the ruin of our fleets, if such persons
were continued in command, they neither having experience nor being
capable of learning, because they would not submit to the fatigue and
inconvenience which those who were bred seamen would undergo, in those
so otherwise useful swift frigates.These being to encounter the
greatest ships would be able to protect, set on, and bring off, those
who should manage the fire ships, and the Prince who should first store
himself with numbers of such fire ships, would, through the help and
countenance of such frigates, be able to ruin the greatest force of such
vast ships as could be sent to sea, by the dexterity of working those
light, swift ships to guard the fire ships.He concluded there would
shortly be no other method of seafight; and that great ships and
men-of-war, however stored with guns and men, must submit to those who
should encounter them with far less number.He represented to us the
dreadful effect of these fire ships; that he continually observed in our
late maritime war with the Dutch that, when an enemy's fire ship
approached, the most valiant commander and common sailors were in such
consternation, that though then, of all times, there was most need of
the guns, bombs, etc., to keep the mischief off, they grew pale and
astonished, as if of a quite other mean soul, that they slunk about,
forsook their guns and work as if in despair, every one looking about to
see which way they might get out of their ship, though sure to be
drowned if they did so.This he said was likely to prove hereafter the
method of seafight, likely to be the misfortune of England if they
continued to put gentlemen-commanders over experienced seamen, on
account of their ignorance, effeminacy, and insolence.[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th March, 1690.Burnet, late Bishop of Sarum,
on Heb.13, anatomically describing the texture of the eye; and
that, as it received such innumerable sorts of spies through so very
small a passage to the brain, and that without the least confusion or
trouble, and accordingly judged and reflected on them; so God who made
this sensory, did with the greatest ease and at once see all that was
done through the vast universe, even to the very thought as well as
action.This similitude he continued with much perspicuity and aptness;
and applied it accordingly, for the admonishing us how uprightly we
ought to live and behave ourselves before such an all-seeing Deity; and
how we were to conceive of other his attributes, which we could have no
idea of than by comparing them by what we were able to conceive of the
nature and power of things, which were the objects of our senses; and
therefore it was that in Scripture we attribute those actions and
affections of God by the same of man, not as adequately or in any
proportion like them, but as the only expedient to make some resemblance
of his divine perfections; as when the Scripture says, "God will
remember the sins of the penitent no more:" not as if God could forget
anything, but as intimating he would pass by such penitents and receive
them to mercy.Asaph's, Almoner to the new Queen, with
the famous lawyer Sir George Mackenzie (late Lord Advocate of Scotland),
against whom both the Bishop and myself had written and published books,
but now most friendly reconciled.[73] He related to us many particulars
of Scotland, the present sad condition of it, the inveterate hatred
which the Presbyterians show to the family of the Stuarts, and the
exceeding tyranny of those bigots who acknowledge no superior on earth,
in civil or divine matters, maintaining that the people only have the
right of government; their implacable hatred to the Episcopal Order and
Church of England.He observed that the first Presbyterian dissents from
our discipline were introduced by the Jesuits' order, about the 20 of
Queen Elizabeth, a famous Jesuit among them feigning himself a
Protestant, and who was the first who began to pray extempore, and
brought in that which they since called, and are still so fond of,
praying by the Spirit.This Jesuit remained many years before he was
discovered, afterward died in Scotland, where he was buried at...
having yet on his monument, "_Rosa inter spinas_."[Footnote 73: Sir George, as we have seen, had written in praise of
    a Private Life, which Mr.Evelyn answered by a book in praise of
    Public Life and Active Employment.]Charlton's curiosities, both
of art and nature, and his full and rare collection of medals, which
taken altogether, in all kinds, is doubtless one of the most perfect
assemblages of rarities that can be any where seen.I much admired the
contortions of the Thea root, which was so perplexed, large, and
intricate, and withal hard as box, that it was wonderful to consider.King William set forth on his Irish expedition, leaving
the Queen Regent.Pepys read to me his Remonstrance, showing with
what malice and injustice he was suspected with Sir Anthony Deane about
the timber, of which the thirty ships were built by a late Act of
Parliament, with the exceeding danger which the fleet would shortly be
in, by reason of the tyranny and incompetency of those who now managed
the Admiralty and affairs of the Navy, of which he gave an accurate
state, and showed his great ability.Asaph; his
conversation was on the Vaudois in Savoy, who had been thought so near
destruction and final extirpation by the French, being totally given up
to slaughter, so that there were no hopes for them; but now it pleased
God that the Duke of Savoy, who had hitherto joined with the French in
their persecution, being now pressed by them to deliver up Saluzzo and
Turin as cautionary towns, on suspicion that he might at last come into
the Confederacy of the German Princes, did secretly concert measures
with, and afterward declared for, them.He then invited these poor
people from their dispersion among the mountains whither they had fled,
and restored them to their country, their dwellings, and the exercise of
their religion, and begged pardon for the ill usage they had received,
charging it on the cruelty of the French who forced him to it.These
being the remainder of those persecuted Christians which the Bishop of
St.Asaph had so long affirmed to be the two witnesses spoken of in the
Revelation, who should be killed and brought to life again, it was
looked on as an extraordinary thing that this prophesying Bishop should
persuade two fugitive ministers of the Vaudois to return to their
country, and furnish them with L20 toward their journey, at that very
time when nothing but universal destruction was to be expected, assuring
them and showing them from the Apocalypse, that their countrymen should
be returned safely to their country before they arrived.This happening
contrary to all expectation and appearance, did exceedingly credit the
Bishop's confidence how that prophecy of the witnesses should come to
pass, just at the time, and the very month, he had spoken of some years
before.Boyle and Lady Ranelagh his sister, to
whom he explained the necessity of it so fully, and so learnedly made
out, with what events were immediately to follow, viz, the French King's
ruin, the calling of the Jews to be near at hand, but that the Kingdom
of Antichrist would not yet be utterly destroyed till thirty years, when
Christ should begin the Millenium, not as personally and visibly
reigning on earth, but that the true religion and universal peace should
obtain through all the world.Mede, and
other interpreters of these events failed, by mistaking and reckoning
the year as the Latins and others did, to consist of the present
calculation, so many days to the year, whereas the Apocalypse reckons
after the Persian account, as Daniel did, whose visions St.John all
along explains as meaning only the Christian Church.Pepys, who the next day was sent to the
Gatehouse,[74] and several great persons to the Tower, on suspicion of
being affected to King James; among them was the Earl of Clarendon, the
Queen's uncle.King William having vanquished King James in Ireland,
there was much public rejoicing.It seems the Irish in King James's army
would not stand, but the English-Irish and French made great resistance.Walker, who so bravely defended
Londonderry.King William received a slight wound by the grazing of a
cannon bullet on his shoulder, which he endured with very little
interruption of his pursuit.Hamilton, who broke his word about
Tyrconnel, was taken.It is reported that King James is gone back to
France.Drogheda and Dublin surrendered, and if King William be
returning, we may say of him as Caesar said, "_Veni, vidi, vici_."But to
alloy much of this, the French fleet rides in our channel, ours not
daring to interpose, and the enemy threatening to land.[Footnote 74: Poor Pepys, as the reader knows, had already undergone
    an imprisonment, with perhaps just as much reason as the present, on
    the absurd accusation of having sent information to the French Court
    of the state of the English Navy.][Sidenote: LONDON]

27th June, 1690.I went to visit some friends in the Tower, when asking
for Lord Clarendon, they by mistake directed me to the Earl of
Torrington, who about three days before had been sent for from the
fleet, and put into the Tower for cowardice and not fighting the French
fleet, which having beaten a squadron of the Hollanders, while
Torrington did nothing, did now ride masters of the sea, threatening a
descent.This afternoon a camp of about 4,000 men was begun to
be formed on Blackheath.Pepys, now suffered to return to his
house, on account of indisposition.The Duke of Grafton came to visit me, going to his
ship at the mouth of the river, in his way to Ireland (where he was
slain).The French landed some soldiers at Teignmouth, in
Devon, and burned some poor houses.The French fleet still hovering
about the western coast, and we having 300 sail of rich merchant-ships
in the bay of Plymouth, our fleet began to move toward them, under three
admirals.The country in the west all on their guard.A very
extraordinary fine season; but on the 12th was a very great storm of
thunder and lightning, and on the 15th the season much changed to wet
and cold.The militia and trained bands, horse and foot, which were up
through England, were dismissed.The French King having news that King
William was slain, and his army defeated in Ireland, caused such a
triumph at Paris, and all over France, as was never heard of; when, in
the midst of it, the unhappy King James being vanquished, by a speedy
flight and escape, himself brought the news of his own defeat.I was desired to be one of the bail of the Earl of
Clarendon, for his release from the Tower, with divers noblemen.Asaph expounds his prophecies to me and Mr.The troops from Blackheath march to Portsmouth.That sweet and hopeful
youth, Sir Charles Tuke, died of the wounds he received in the fight of
the Boyne, to the great sorrow of all his friends, being (I think) the
last male of that family, to which my wife is related.A more virtuous
young gentleman I never knew; he was learned for his age, having had the
advantage of the choicest breeding abroad, both as to arts and arms; he
had traveled much, but was so unhappy as to fall in the side of his
unfortunate King.The unseasonable and most tempestuous weather happening, the naval
expedition is hindered, and the extremity of wet causes the siege of
Limerick to be raised, King William returned to England.Lord Sidney
left Governor of what is conquered in Ireland, which is near three parts
[in four].An extraordinary sharp, cold, east
wind.The French General, with Tyrconnel and their
forces, gone back to France, beaten out by King William.The Duke of Grafton was there mortally wounded and dies.The 8th of this month Lord Spencer wrote me
word from Althorpe, that there happened an earthquake the day before in
the morning, which, though short, sensibly shook the house.The
"Gazette" acquainted us that the like happened at the same time,
half-past seven, at Barnstaple, Holyhead, and Dublin.We were not
sensible of it here.Kinsale at last surrendered, meantime King James's
party burn all the houses they have in their power, and among them that
stately palace of Lord Ossory's, which lately cost, as reported,
L40,000.By a disastrous accident, a third-rate ship, the Breda, blew up
and destroyed all on board; in it were twenty-five prisoners of war.She
was to have sailed for England the next day.Went to the Countess of Clancarty, to condole with
her concerning her debauched and dissolute son, who had done so much
mischief in Ireland, now taken and brought prisoner to the Tower.Exceeding great storms, yet a warm season.Pepys's memorials to Lord Godolphin, now
resuming the commission of the Treasury, to the wonder of all his
friends.Having been chosen President of the Royal Society, I
desired to decline it, and with great difficulty devolved the election
on Sir Robert Southwell, Secretary of State to King William in Ireland.Hough, President of Magdalen College, Oxford,
who was displaced with several of the Fellows for not taking the oath
imposed by King James, now made a Bishop.Most of this month cold and
frost.One Johnson, a Knight, was executed at Tyburn for being an
accomplice with Campbell, brother to Lord Argyle, in stealing a young
heiress.This week a PLOT was discovered for a general
rising against the new Government, for which (Henry) Lord Clarendon and
others were sent to the Tower.The next day, I went to see Lord
Clarendon.Trial of Lord Preston, as not
being an English Peer, hastened at the Old Bailey.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th January, 1691.Lord Preston condemned about a design to bring in
King James by the French.I went to visit Monsieur Justell and the Library at
St.James's, in which that learned man had put the MSS.(which were in
good number) into excellent order, they having lain neglected for many
years.Divers medals had been stolen and embezzled.Dined at Sir William Fermor's, who showed me many good
pictures.After dinner, a French servant played rarely on the lute.Sir
William had now bought all the remaining statues collected with so much
expense by the famous Thomas, Earl of Arundel, and sent them to his seat
at Easton, near Towcester.[75]

    [Footnote 75: They are now at Oxford, having been presented to the
    University in 1755 by Henrietta, Countess Dowager of Pomfret, widow
    of Thomas, the first Earl.]Lord Sidney, principal Secretary of State, gave me a
letter to Lord Lucas, Lieutenant of the Tower, to permit me to visit
Lord Clarendon; which this day I did, and dined with him.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th April, 1691.This night, a sudden and terrible fire burned down all
the buildings over the stone gallery at Whitehall to the water side,
beginning at the apartment of the late Duchess of Portsmouth (which had
been pulled down and rebuilt no less than three times to please her),
and consuming other lodgings of such lewd creatures, who debauched both
King Charles II.The King returned out of Holland just as this accident
happened--Proclamation against the <DW7>s, etc.Sloane's curiosities, being an
universal collection of the natural productions of Jamaica, consisting
of plants, fruits, corals, minerals, stones, earth, shells, animals, and
insects, collected with great judgment; several folios of dried plants,
and one which had about 80 several sorts of ferns, and another of
grasses; the Jamaica pepper, in branch, leaves, flower, fruit, etc.This
collection,[76] with his Journal and other philosophical and natural
discourses and observations, indeed very copious and extraordinary,
sufficient to furnish a history of that island, to which I encouraged
him.[Footnote 76: It now forms part of the collection in the British
    Museum.]The Archbishop of Canterbury, and Bishops of Ely, Bath
and Wells, Peterborough, Gloucester, and the rest who would not take the
oaths to King William, were now displaced; and in their rooms, Dr.Paul's, was made Archbishop: Patrick removed from
Chichester to Ely; Cumberland to Gloucester.I dined with Lord Clarendon in the Tower.I visited the Earl and Countess of Sunderland, now
come to kiss the King's hand after his return from Holland.I went to visit the Archbishop of Canterbury [Sancroft]
yet at Lambeth.I found him alone, and discoursing of the times,
especially of the newly designed Bishops; he told me that by no canon or
divine law they could justify the removing of the present incumbents;
that Dr.Beveridge, designed Bishop of Bath and Wells, came to ask his
advice; that the Archbishop told him, though he should give it, he
believed he would not take it; the Doctor said he would; why then, says
the Archbishop, when they come to ask, say "_Nolo_," and say it from the
heart; there is nothing easier than to resolve yourself what is to be
done in the case: the Doctor seemed to deliberate.What he will do I
know not, but Bishop Ken, who is to be put out, is exceedingly beloved
in his diocese; and, if he and the rest should insist on it, and plead
their interest as freeholders, it is believed there would be difficulty
in their case, and it may endanger a schism and much disturbance, so as
wise men think it had been better to have let them alone, than to have
proceeded with this rigor to turn them out for refusing to swear against
their consciences.I asked at parting, when his Grace removed; he said
that he had not yet received any summons, but I found the house
altogether disfurnished and his books packed up.I went with my son, and brother-in-law, Glanville, and
his son, to Wotton, to solemnize the funeral of my nephew, which was
performed the next day very decently and orderly by the herald in the
afternoon, a very great appearance of the country being there.I was the
chief mourner; the pall was held by Sir Francis Vincent, Sir Richard
Onslow, Mr.Thomas Howard (son to Sir Robert, and Captain of the King's
Guard), Mr.Herbert, nephew to Lord Herbert of
Cherbury, and cousin-german to my deceased nephew.He was laid in the
vault at Wotton Church, in the burying place of the family.A great
concourse of coaches and people accompanied the solemnity.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th June, 1691.I went to visit Lord Clarendon, still prisoner in the
Tower, though Lord Preston being pardoned was released.Cumberland, the
new Bishop of Norwich,[77] Dr.Lloyd having been put out for not
acknowledging the Government.Cumberland is a very learned, excellent
man.Tillotson, at Lambeth, by the
Sheriff; Archbishop Sancroft was gone, but had left his nephew to keep
possession; and he refusing to deliver it up on the Queen's message, was
dispossessed by the Sheriff, and imprisoned.This stout demeanor of the
few Bishops who refused to take the oaths to King William, animated a
great party to forsake the churches, so as to threaten a schism; though
those who looked further into the ancient practice, found that when (as
formerly) there were Bishops displaced on secular accounts, the people
never refused to acknowledge the new Bishops, provided they were not
heretics.The truth is, the whole clergy had till now stretched the duty
of passive obedience, so that the proceedings against these Bishops gave
no little occasion of exceptions; but this not amounting to heresy,
there was a necessity of receiving the new Bishops, to prevent a failure
of that order in the Church.I went to visit Lord Clarendon in the
Tower, but he was gone into the country for air by the Queen's
permission, under the care of his warden.Cumberland was made Bishop of
    Peterborough and Dr.Lloyd in the see of
    Norwich.]Stringfellow preach his first
sermon in the newly erected Church of Trinity, in Conduit Street; to
which I did recommend him to Dr.Tenison for the constant preacher and
lecturer.This Church, formerly built of timber on Hounslow-Heath by
King James for the mass priests, being begged by Dr.Martin's, was set up by that public-minded, charitable, and pious
man near my son's dwelling in Dover Street, chiefly at the charge of the
Doctor.I know him to be an excellent preacher and a fit person.Martin's, which is the Doctor's parish, he
was not only content, but was the sole industrious mover, that it should
be made a separate parish, in regard of the neighborhood having become
so populous.Wherefore to countenance and introduce the new minister,
and take possession of a gallery designed for my son's family, I went to
London, where,

19th July, 1691.Tenison preached the first sermon,
taking his text from Psalm xxvi."Lord, I have loved the habitation
of thy house, and the place where thine honor dwelleth."In concluding,
he gave that this should be made a parish church so soon as the
Parliament sat, and was to be dedicated to the Holy Trinity, in honor of
the three undivided persons in the Deity; and he minded them to attend
to that faith of the church, now especially that Arianism, Socinianism,
and atheism began to spread among us.Stringfellow
preached on Luke vii."The centurion who had built a synagogue."He
proceeded to the due praise of persons of such public spirit, and thence
to such a character of pious benefactors in the person of the generous
centurion, as was comprehensive of all the virtues of an accomplished
Christian, in a style so full, eloquent, and moving, that I never heard
a sermon more apposite to the occasion.He modestly insinuated the
obligation they had to that person who should be the author and promoter
of such public works for the benefit of mankind, especially to the
advantage of religion, such as building and endowing churches,
hospitals, libraries, schools, procuring the best editions of useful
books, by which he handsomely intimated who it was that had been so
exemplary for his benefaction to that place.Tenison, had also erected and furnished a public library [in
St.Martin's]; and set up two or three free schools at his own charges.Besides this, he was of an exemplary, holy life, took great pains in
constantly preaching, and incessantly employing himself to promote the
service of God both in public and private.I never knew a man of a more
universal and generous spirit, with so much modesty, prudence, and
piety.The great victory of King William's army in Ireland was looked on as
decisive of that war.Ruth, who had been so
cruel to the poor Protestants in France, was slain, with divers of the
best commanders; nor was it cheap to us, having 1,000 killed, but of the
enemy 4,000 or 5,000.An extraordinary hot season, yet refreshed by some
thundershowers.No sermon in the church in the afternoon, and the
curacy ill-served.A sermon by the curate; an honest discourse, but read
without any spirit, or seeming concern; a great fault in the education
of young preachers.Great thunder and lightning on Thursday, but the
rain and wind very violent.Our fleet come in to lay up the great ships;
nothing done at sea, pretending that we cannot meet the French.A great storm at sea; we lost the "Coronation" and
"Harwich," above 600 men perishing.Our navy come in without
having performed anything, yet there has been great loss of ships by
negligence, and unskillful men governing the fleet and Navy board.I visited the Earl of Dover, who having made his
peace with the King, was now come home.The relation he gave of the
strength of the French King, and the difficulty of our forcing him to
fight, and any way making impression into France, was very wide from
what we fancied.8th to 30th November, 1691.An extraordinary dry and warm season,
without frost, and like a new spring; such as had not been known for
many years.Part of the King's house at Kensington was burned.Discourse of another PLOT, in which several great
persons were named, but believed to be a sham.--A proposal in the House
of Commons that every officer in the whole nation who received a salary
above L500 or otherwise by virtue of his office, should contribute it
wholly to the support of the war with France, and this upon their oath.My daughter-in-law was brought to bed of a
daughter.An exceedingly dry and calm winter; no rain for
many past months.Dined at Lambeth with the new Archbishop.Saw the
effect of my greenhouse furnace, set up by the Archbishop's son-in-law.Charlton's collection of spiders,
birds, scorpions, and other serpents, etc.This last week died that pious, admirable
Christian, excellent philosopher, and my worthy friend, Mr.Boyle, aged
about 65,--a great loss to all that knew him, and to the public.[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th January, 1692.Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, preached on Eccles.He concluded
with an eulogy due to the deceased, who made God and religion the scope
of all his excellent talents in the knowledge of nature, and who had
arrived to so high a degree in it, accompanied with such zeal and
extraordinary piety, which he showed in the whole course of his life,
particularly in his exemplary charity on all occasions,--that he gave
L1,000 yearly to the distressed refugees of France and Ireland; was at
the charge of translating the Scriptures into the Irish and Indian
tongues, and was now promoting a Turkish translation, as he had formerly
done of Grotius "on the Truth of the Christian Religion" into Arabic,
which he caused to be dispersed in the eastern countries; that he had
settled a fund for preachers who should preach expressly against
Atheists, Libertines, Socinians, and Jews; that he had in his will given
L8,000 to charitable uses; but that his private charities were
extraordinary.He dilated on his learning in Hebrew and Greek, his
reading of the fathers, and solid knowledge in theology, once
deliberating about taking Holy Orders, and that at the time of
restoration of King Charles II., when he might have made a great figure
in the nation as to secular honor and titles, his fear of not being able
to discharge so weighty a duty as the first, made him decline that, and
his humility the other.He spoke of his civility to strangers, the great
good which he did by his experience in medicine and chemistry, and to
what noble ends he applied himself to his darling studies; the works,
both pious and useful, which he published; the exact life he led, and
the happy end he made.Something was touched of his sister, the Lady
Ranelagh, who died but a few days before him.And truly all this was but
his due, without any grain of flattery.This week a most execrable murder was committed on Dr.Clench, father of
that extraordinary learned child whom I have before noticed.Under
pretense of carrying him in a coach to see a patient, they strangled him
in it; and, sending away the coachman under some pretense, they left his
dead body in the coach, and escaped in the dusk of the evening.Tenison, now
Bishop of Lincoln, in Trinity Church, being the first that was
christened there.A frosty and dry season continued; many persons die
of apoplexy, more than usual.Lord Marlborough, Lieutenant-General of
the King's army in England, gentleman of the bedchamber, etc., dismissed
from all his charges, military and other, for his excessive taking of
bribes, covetousness, and extortion on all occasions from his inferior
officers.Note, this was the Lord who was entirely advanced by King
James, and was the first who betrayed and forsook his master.He was son
of Sir Winston Churchill of the Greencloth.Boyle having made me one of the trustees for
his charitable bequests, I went to a meeting of the Bishop of Lincoln,
Sir Rob.... wood, and serjeant, Rotheram, to settle that clause in the
will which related to charitable uses, and especially the appointing and
electing a minister to preach one sermon the first Sunday in the month,
during the four summer months, expressly against Atheists, Deists,
Libertines, Jews, etc., without descending to any other controversy
whatever, for which L50 per annum is to be paid quarterly to the
preacher; and, at the end of three years, to proceed to a new election
of some other able divine, or to continue the same, as the trustees
should judge convenient.Bentley, chaplain to
the Bishop of Worcester (Dr.The first sermon was
appointed for the first Sunday in March, at St.Martin's; the second
Sunday in April, at Bow Church, and so alternately.Lord Marlborough having used words against the
King, and been discharged from all his great places, his wife was
forbidden the Court, and the Princess of Denmark was desired by the
Queen to dismiss her from her service; but she refusing to do so, goes
away from Court to Sion house.Divers new Lords made: Sir Henry Capel,
Sir William Fermor, etc.The
Parliament adjourned, not well satisfied with affairs.The business of
the East India Company, which they would have reformed, let fall.The
Duke of Norfolk does not succeed in his endeavor to be divorced.[78]

    [Footnote 78: See _post_ pp.My son was made one of the Commissioners of the
Revenue and Treasury of Ireland, to which employment he had a mind, far
from my wishes.I visited the Earl of Peterborough, who showed me the
picture of the Prince of Wales, newly brought out of France, seeming in
my opinion very much to resemble the Queen his mother, and of a most
vivacious countenance.The Queen Dowager went out of
England toward Portugal, as pretended, against the advice of all her
friends.So excellent a discourse against the Epicurean system is
not to be recapitulated in a few words.He came to me to ask whether I
thought it should be printed, or that there was anything in it which I
desired to be altered.I took this as a civility, and earnestly desired
it should be printed, as one of the most learned and convincing
discourses I had ever heard.King James sends a letter written and directed
by his own hand to several of the Privy Council, and one to his
daughter, the Queen Regent, informing them of the Queen being ready to
be brought to bed, and summoning them to be at the birth by the middle
of May, promising as from the French King, permission to come and return
in safety.Much apprehension of a French invasion, and of an
universal rising.Unkindness
between the Queen and her sister.Very cold and unseasonable weather,
scarce a leaf on the trees.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th May, 1692.Reports of an invasion were very hot, and alarmed the
city, Court, and people; nothing but securing suspected persons, sending
forces to the seaside, and hastening out the fleet.Continued discourse
of the French invasion, and of ours in France.The eastern wind so
constantly blowing, gave our fleet time to unite, which had been so
tardy in preparation, that, had not God thus wonderfully favored, the
enemy would in all probability have fallen upon us.Many daily secured,
and proclamations out for more conspirators.My kinsman, Sir Edward Evelyn, of Long Ditton, died
suddenly.I dined at my cousin Cheny's, son to my Lord Cheny, who
married my cousin Pierpoint.My niece, M. Evelyn, was now married to Sir Cyril Wyche,
Secretary of State for Ireland.After all our apprehensions of being
invaded, and doubts of our success by sea, it pleased God to give us a
great naval victory, to the utter ruin of the French fleet, their
admiral and all their best men-of-war, transport-ships, etc.Though this day was set apart expressly for celebrating
the memorable birth, return, and restoration of the late King Charles
II., there was no notice taken of it, nor any part of the office annexed
to the Common Prayer Book made use of, which I think was ill done, in
regard his restoration not only redeemed us from anarchy and confusion,
but restored the Church of England as it were miraculously.I went to Windsor to carry my grandson to Eton School,
where I met my Lady Stonehouse and other of my daughter-in-law's
relations, who came on purpose to see her before her journey into
Ireland.We went to see the castle, which we found furnished and very
neatly kept, as formerly, only that the arms in the guard chamber and
keep were removed and carried away.An exceeding great storm of wind and
rain, in some places stripping the trees of their fruit and leaves as if
it had been winter; and an extraordinary wet season, with great floods.I went with my wife, son, and daughter, to Eton, to see
my grandson, and thence to my Lord Godolphin's, at Cranburn, where we
lay, and were most honorably entertained.George's
Chapel, and returned to London late in the evening.Hewer's at Clapham, where he has an excellent,
useful, and capacious house on the Common, built by Sir Den.Gauden, and
by him sold to Mr.Hewer, who got a very considerable estate in the
Navy, in which, from being Mr.Pepys's clerk, he came to be one of the
principal officers, but was put out of all employment on the Revolution,
as were all the best officers, on suspicion of being no friends to the
change; such were put in their places, as were most shamefully ignorant
and unfit.Hewer lives very handsomely and friendly to everybody.Our fleet was now sailing on their long pretense of a descent on the
French coast; but, after having sailed one hundred leagues, returned,
the admiral and officers disagreeing as to the place where they were to
land, and the time of year being so far spent,--to the great dishonor of
those at the helm, who concerted their matters so indiscreetly, or, as
some thought, designedly.This whole summer was exceedingly wet and rainy, the like had not been
known since the year 1648; while in Ireland they had not known so great
a drought.I went to visit the Bishop of Lincoln, when, among
other things, he told me that one Dr.Chaplin, of University College in
Oxford, was the person who wrote the "Whole Duty of Man"; that he used
to read it to his pupil, and communicated it to Dr.Sterne, afterward
Archbishop of York, but would never suffer any of his pupils to have a
copy of it.Came the sad news of the hurricane and
earthquake, which has destroyed almost the whole Island of Jamaica, many
thousands having perished.My son, his wife, and little daughter, went for
Ireland, there to reside as one of the Commissioners of the Revenue.There happened an earthquake, which, though not so
great as to do any harm in England, was universal in all these parts of
Europe.It shook the house at Wotton, but was not perceived by any save
a servant or two, who were making my bed, and another in a garret.I and
the rest being at dinner below in the parlor, were not sensible of it.The dreadful one in Jamaica this summer was profanely and ludicrously
represented in a puppet play, or some such lewd pastime, in the fair of
Southwark, which caused the Queen to put down that idle and vicious mock
show.This season was so exceedingly cold, by reason of a
long and tempestuous northeast wind, that this usually pleasant month
was very uncomfortable.Harbord dies at
Belgrade; Lord Paget sent Ambassador in his room.There was a vestry called about repairing or new
building of the church [at Deptford], which I thought unseasonable in
regard of heavy taxes, and other improper circumstances, which I there
declared.A solemn Thanksgiving for our victory at sea, safe
return of the King, etc.Lancaster, the new Vicar of St.A signal robbery in Hertfordshire of the tax money bringing out of the
north toward London.They were set upon by several desperate persons,
who dismounted and stopped all travelers on the road, and guarding them
in a field, when the exploit was done, and the treasure taken, they
killed all the horses of those whom they stayed, to hinder pursuit,
being sixteen horses.They then dismissed those that they had
dismounted.With much reluctance we gratified Sir J.
Rotherham, one of Mr.Boyle's trustees, by admitting the Bishop of Bath
and Wells to be lecturer for the next year, instead of Mr.Bentley, who
had so worthily acquitted himself.We intended to take him in again the
next year.[Sidenote: LONDON]

January, 1692-93.Contest in Parliament about a self-denying Act, that
no Parliament man should have any office; it wanted only two or three
voices to have been carried.The Duke of Norfolk's bill for a divorce
thrown out, he having managed it very indiscreetly.The quarrel between
Admiral Russell and Lord Nottingham yet undetermined.After five days' trial and extraordinary contest,
the Lord Mohun was acquitted by the Lords of the murder of Montford, the
player, notwithstanding the judges, from the pregnant witnesses of the
fact, had declared him guilty; but whether in commiseration of his
youth, being not eighteen years old, though exceedingly dissolute, or
upon whatever other reason, the King himself present some part of the
trial, and satisfied, as they report, that he was culpable.69 acquitted
him, only 14 condemned him.Unheard of stories of the universal increase of witches in New England;
men, women, and children, devoting themselves to the devil, so as to
threaten the subversion of the government.[79] At the same time there
was a conspiracy among the <DW64>s in Barbadoes to murder all their
masters, discovered by overhearing a discourse of two of the slaves, and
so preventing the execution of the design.France in the utmost misery and poverty for want of corn and
subsistence, while the ambitious King is intent to pursue his conquests
on the rest of his neighbors both by sea and land.Our Admiral, Russell,
laid aside for not pursuing the advantage he had obtained over the
French in the past summer; three others chosen in his place.Burnet,
Bishop of Salisbury's book burned by the hangman for an expression of
the King's title by conquest, on a complaint of Joseph How, a member of
Parliament, little better than a madman.[Footnote 79: Some account of these poor people is given in Bray and
    Manning's "History of Surrey," ii.Miller, Vicar of Effingham, in that county, who was chaplain to
    the King's forces in the colony from 1692 to 1695.Some of the
    accused were convicted and executed; but Sir William Phipps, the
    Governor, had the good sense to reprieve, and afterward pardon,
    several; and the Queen approved his conduct.]The Bishop of Lincoln preached in the afternoon at
the Tabernacle near Golden Square, set up by him.Proposals of a
marriage between Mr.Hitherto an
exceedingly warm winter, such as has seldom been known, and portending
an unprosperous spring as to the fruits of the earth; our climate
requires more cold and winterly weather.The dreadful and astonishing
earthquake swallowing up Catania, and other famous and ancient cities,
with more than 100,000 persons in Sicily, on 11th January last, came now
to be reported among us.An extraordinary deep snow, after almost no winter,
and a sudden gentle thaw.A deplorable earthquake at Malta, since that
of Sicily, nearly as great.A new Secretary of State, Sir John Trenchard; the
Attorney-General, Somers, made Lord-Keeper, a young lawyer of
extraordinary merit.King William goes toward Flanders; but returns, the
wind being contrary.I met the King going to Gravesend to embark in his
yacht for Holland.My daughter Susanna was married to William Draper,
Esq., in the chapel of Ely House, by Dr.Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln
(since Archbishop).I gave her in portion L4,000, her jointure is L500
per annum.I pray Almighty God to give his blessing to this marriage!She is a good child, religious, discreet, ingenious, and qualified with
all the ornaments of her sex.She has a peculiar talent in design, as
painting in oil and miniature, and an extraordinary genius for whatever
hands can do with a needle.She has the French tongue, has read most of
the Greek and Roman authors and poets, using her talents with great
modesty; exquisitely shaped, and of an agreeable countenance.This
character is due to her, though coming from her father.Much of this
week spent in ceremonies, receiving visits and entertaining relations,
and a great part of the next in returning visits.We accompanied my daughter to her husband's house,
where with many of his and our relations we were magnificently treated.There we left her in an apartment very richly adorned and furnished, and
I hope in as happy a condition as could be wished, and with the great
satisfaction of all our friends; for which God be praised!Muttering of a design
to bring forces under color of an expected descent, to be a standing
army for other purposes.Talk of a declaration of the French King,
offering mighty advantages to the confederates, exclusive of King
William; and another of King James, with an universal pardon, and
referring the composing of all differences to a Parliament.These were
yet but discourses; but something is certainly under it.A declaration
or manifesto from King James, so written, that many thought it
reasonable, and much more to the purpose than any of his former.I went to my Lord Griffith's chapel; the common
church office was used for the King without naming the person, with some
other, apposite to the necessity and circumstances of the time.I dined at Sir William Godolphin's; and, after evening
prayer, visited the Duchess of Grafton.I saw a great auction of pictures in the Banqueting
house, Whitehall.They had been my Lord Melford's, now Ambassador from
King James at Rome, and engaged to his creditors here.Lord Mulgrave and
Sir Edward Seymour came to my house, and desired me to go with them to
the sale.Divers more of the great lords, etc., were there, and bought
pictures dear enough.There were some very excellent of Vandyke, Rubens,
and Bassan.Lord Godolphin bought the picture of the Boys, by Murillo
the Spaniard, for 80 guineas, dear enough; my nephew Glanville, the old
Earl of Arundel's head by Rubens, for L20.Growing late, I did not stay
till all were sold.A very wet hay harvest, and little summer as yet.Parr at Camberwell,
preached an excellent sermon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

13th July, 1693.I saw the Queen's rare cabinets and collection of
china; which was wonderfully rich and plentiful, but especially a large
cabinet, looking-glass frame and stands, all of amber, much of it white,
with historical bas-reliefs and statues, with medals carved in them,
esteemed worth L4,000, sent by the Duke of Brandenburgh, whose country,
Prussia, abounds with amber, cast up by the sea; divers other China and
Indian cabinets, screens, and hangings.In her library were many books
in English, French, and Dutch, of all sorts; a cupboard of gold plate; a
cabinet of silver filagree, which I think was our Queen Mary's, and
which, in my opinion, should have been generously sent to her.I dined with Lord Mulgrave, with the Earl of
Devonshire, Mr.Hampden (a scholar and fine gentleman), Dr.Davenant,
Sir Henry Vane, and others, and saw and admired the Venus of Correggio,
which Lord Mulgrave had newly bought of Mr.Daun for L250; one of the
best paintings I ever saw.Lord Capel, Sir Cyril Wyche, and Mr.Duncomb, made
Lord Justices in Ireland; Lord Sydney recalled, and made Master of the
Ordnance.Very lovely harvest weather, and a wholesome season,
but no garden fruit.Lord Nottingham resigned as Secretary of State; the
Commissioners of the Admiralty ousted, and Russell restored to his
office.The season continued very wet, as it had nearly all the summer,
if one might call it summer, in which there was no fruit, but corn was
very plentiful.In the lottery set up after the Venetian manner by
Mr.Neale, Sir R. Haddock, one of the Commissioners of the Navy, had the
greatest lot, L3,000; my coachman L40.Was the funeral of Captain Young, who died of the
stone and great age.I think he was the first who in the first war with
Cromwell against Spain, took the Governor of Havanna, and another rich
prize, and struck the first stroke against the Dutch fleet in the first
war with Holland in the time of the Rebellion; a sober man and an
excellent seaman.Much importuned to take the office of President of
the Royal Society, but I again declined it.We all dined at Pontac's as usual.Bentley preached at the Tabernacle, near Golden
Square.I gave my voice for him to proceed on his former subject the
following year in Mr.Boyle's lecture, in which he had been interrupted
by the importunity of Sir J. Rotheram that the Bishop of Chichester[80]
might be chosen the year before, to the great dissatisfaction of the
Bishop of Lincoln and myself.The Duchess of
Grafton's appeal to the House of Lords for the Prothonotary's place
given to the late Duke and to her son by King Charles II., now
challenged by the Lord Chief Justice.The judges were severely reproved
on something they said.[Footnote 80: A mistake for Bath and Wells.Bishop Kidder is
    referred to.]Prince Lewis of Baden came to London, and was much
feasted.Danish ships arrested carrying corn and naval stores to France.Dryden, the poet, who now intended to write no more plays, being intent
on his translation of Virgil.He read to us his prologue and epilogue to
his valedictory play now shortly to be acted.Lord Macclesfield, Lord Warrington, and Lord
Westmorland, all died within about one week.Several persons shot,
hanged, and made away with themselves.Now was the great trial of the appeal of Lord Bath
and Lord Montagu before the Lords, for the estate of the late Duke of
Albemarle.Stringfellow preached at Trinity parish, being
restored to that place, after the contest between the Queen and the
Bishop of London who had displaced him.Came the dismal news of the disaster befallen our
Turkey fleet by tempest, to the almost utter ruin of that trade, the
convoy of three or four men-of-war, and divers merchant ships, with all
their men and lading, having perished.[Sidenote: LONDON]

25th March, 1694.Martin's, preached; he was
likewise put in by the Queen, on the issue of her process with the
Bishop of London.I went to the Duke of Norfolk, to desire him to make
cousin Evelyn of Nutfield one of the Deputy-Lieutenants of Surrey, and
entreat him to dismiss my brother, now unable to serve by reason of age
and infirmity.The Duke granted the one, but would not suffer my brother
to resign his commission, desiring he should keep the honor of it during
his life, though he could not act.He professed great kindness to our
family.Sharp, Archbishop of York, preached in the
afternoon at the Tabernacle, by Soho.Bentley, our Boyle Lecturer, Chaplain to the
Bishop of Worcester, came to see me.A fiery exhalation rising out of the sea, spread itself
in Montgomeryshire a furlong broad, and many miles in length, burning
all straw, hay, thatch, and grass, but doing no harm to trees, timber,
or any solid things, only firing barns, or thatched houses.It left such
a taint on the grass as to kill all the cattle that eat of it.I saw the
attestations in the hands of the sufferers."The
Berkeley Castle" sunk by the French coming from the East Indies, worth
L200,000.The French took our castle of Gamboo in Guinea, so that the
Africa Actions fell to L30, and the India to L80.Some regiments of
Highland Dragoons were on their march through England; they were of
large stature, well appointed and disciplined.One of them having
reproached a Dutchman for cowardice in our late fight, was attacked by
two Dutchmen, when with his sword he struck off the head of one, and
cleft the skull of the other down to his chin.A very young gentleman named Wilson, the younger son of one who had not
above L200 a year estate, lived in the garb and equipage of the richest
nobleman, for house, furniture, coaches, saddle horses, and kept a
table, and all things accordingly, redeemed his father's estate, and
gave portions to his sisters, being challenged by one Laws, a Scotchman,
was killed in a duel, not fairly.The quarrel arose from his taking away
his own sister from lodging in a house where this Laws had a mistress,
which the mistress of the house thinking a disparagement to it, and
losing by it, instigated Laws to this duel.The mystery is how this so young a gentleman, very sober and
of good fame, could live in such an expensive manner; it could not be
discovered by all possible industry, or entreaty of his friends to make
him reveal it.It did not appear that he was kept by women, play,
coining, padding, or dealing in chemistry; but he would sometimes say
that if he should live ever so long, he had wherewith to maintain
himself in the same manner.He was very civil and well-natured, but of
no great force of understanding.Waller, an extraordinary young
gentleman of great accomplishments, skilled in mathematics, anatomy,
music, painting both in oil and miniature to great perfection, an
excellent botanist, a rare engraver on brass, writer in Latin, and a
poet; and with all this exceedingly modest.His house is an academy of
itself.I carried him to see Brompton Park [by Knightsbridge], where he
was in admiration at the store of rare plants, and the method he found
in that noble nursery, and how well it was cultivated.A public Bank of
L140,000, set up by Act of Parliament among other Acts, and Lotteries
for money to carry on the war.A
great rising of people in Buckinghamshire, on the declaration of a
famous preacher, till now reputed a sober and religious man, that our
Lord Christ appearing to him on the 16th of this month, told him he was
now come down, and would appear publicly at Pentecost, and gather all
the saints, Jews and Gentiles, and lead them to Jerusalem, and begin the
Millennium, and destroying and judging the wicked, deliver the
government of the world to the saints.Great multitudes followed this
preacher, divers of the most zealous brought their goods and
considerable sums of money, and began to live in imitation of the
primitive saints, minding no private concerns, continually dancing and
singing Hallelujah night and day.This brings to mind what I lately
happened to find in Alstedius, that the thousand years should begin this
very year 1694; it is in his "Encyclopaedia Biblica."My copy of the book
printed near sixty years ago.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

4th May, 1694.I went this day with my wife and four servants from Sayes
Court, removing much furniture of all sorts, books, pictures, hangings,
bedding, etc., to furnish the apartment my brother assigned me, and now,
after more than forty years, to spend the rest of my days with him at
Wotton, where I was born; leaving my house at Deptford full furnished,
and three servants, to my son-in-law Draper, to pass the summer in, and
such longer time as he should think fit to make use of it.This being the first Sunday in the month, the blessed
sacrament of the Lord's Supper ought to have been celebrated at Wotton
church, but in this parish it is exceedingly neglected, so that, unless
at the four great feasts, there is no communion hereabouts; which is a
great fault both in ministers and people.I have spoken to my brother,
who is the patron, to discourse the minister about it.Scarcely one
shower has fallen since the beginning of April.This week we had news of my Lord Tiviot having cut his
own throat, through what discontent not yet said.He had been, not many
years past, my colleague in the commission of the Privy Seal, in old
acquaintance, very soberly and religiously inclined.Lord, what are we
without thy continual grace!Lord Falkland, grandson to the learned Lord Falkland, Secretary of State
to King Charles I., and slain in his service, died now of the smallpox.He was a pretty, brisk, understanding, industrious young gentleman; had
formerly been faulty, but now much reclaimed; had also the good luck to
marry a very great fortune, besides being entitled to a vast sum, his
share of the Spanish wreck, taken up at the expense of divers
adventurers.From a Scotch Viscount he was made an English Baron,
designed Ambassador for Holland; had been Treasurer of the Navy, and
advancing extremely in the new Court.All now gone in a moment, and I
think the title is extinct.I know not whether the estate devolves to my
cousin Carew.It was at my Lord Falkland's, whose lady importuned us to
let our daughter be with her some time, so that that dear child took the
same infection, which cost her valuable life.Edwards, minister of Denton, in Sussex, a living in
my brother's gift, came to see him.Wotton, that extraordinary learned
young man, preached excellently.Duncomb, minister of Albury, preached at Wotton, a
very religious and exact discourse.The first great bank for a fund of money being now established by Act of
Parliament, was filled and completed to the sum of L120,000, and put
under the government of the most able and wealthy citizens of London.All who adventured any sum had four per cent., so long as it lay in the
bank, and had power either to take it out at pleasure, or transfer it.Glorious steady weather; corn and all fruits in extraordinary plenty
generally.Lord Berkeley burnt Dieppe and Havre de Grace with
bombs, in revenge for the defeat at Brest.This manner of destructive
war was begun by the French, is exceedingly ruinous, especially falling
on the poorer people, and does not seem to tend to make a more speedy
end of the war; but rather to exasperate and incite to revenge.Many
executed at London for clipping money, now done to that intolerable
extent, that there was hardly any money that was worth above half the
nominal value.I went to visit my cousin, George Evelyn of Nutfield,
where I found a family of ten children, five sons and five
daughters--all beautiful women grown, and extremely well-fashioned.All
painted in one piece, very well, by Mr.Lutterell, in crayon on copper,
and seeming to be as finely painted as the best miniature.They are the
children of two extraordinary beautiful wives.Stormy and unseasonable wet weather this week.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th October, 1694.Paul's to see the choir, now finished
as to the stone work, and the scaffold struck both without and within,
in that part.Some exceptions might perhaps be taken as to the placing
columns on pilasters at the east tribunal.As to the rest it is a piece
of architecture without reproach.The pulling out the forms, like
drawers, from under the stalls, is ingenious.I went also to see the
building beginning near St.Giles's, where seven streets make a star
from a Doric pillar placed in the middle of a circular area; said to be
built by Mr.Neale, introducer of the late lotteries, in imitation of
those at Venice, now set up here, for himself twice, and now one for the
State.Visited the Bishop of Lincoln [Tenison] newly come
on the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who a few days before had
a paralytic stroke,--the same day and month that Archbishop Sancroft was
put out.A very sickly time, especially the smallpox, of which divers
considerable persons died.The State lottery[81] drawing, Mr.Cock, a
French refugee, and a President in the Parliament of Paris for the
Reformed, drew a lot of L1,000 per annum.[Footnote 81: State lotteries finally closed October 18, 1826.]I visited the Marquis of Normanby, and had much
discourse concerning King Charles II.Also concerning
the _quinquina_ which the physicians would not give to the King, at a
time when, in a dangerous ague, it was the only thing that could cure
him (out of envy because it had been brought into vogue by Mr.Tudor, an
apothecary), till Dr.Short, to whom the King sent to know his opinion
of it privately, he being reputed a <DW7> (but who was in truth a very
honest, good Christian), sent word to the King that it was the only
thing which could save his life, and then the King enjoined his
physicians to give it to him, which they did and he recovered.Being
asked by this Lord why they would not prescribe it, Dr.Lower said it
would spoil their practice, or some such expression, and at last
confessed it was a remedy fit only for kings.Exception was taken that
the late Archbishop did not cause any of his Chaplains to use any office
for the sick during his illness.I had news that my dear and worthy friend, Dr.Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln, was made Archbishop of Canterbury, for which
I thank God and rejoice, he being most worthy of it, for his learning,
piety, and prudence.He being my
proxy, gave my vote for Dr.The smallpox increased exceedingly, and was very
mortal.The Queen died of it on the 28th.The deaths by
smallpox increased to five hundred more than in the preceding week.The
King and Princess Anne reconciled, and she was invited to keep her Court
at Whitehall, having hitherto lived privately at Berkeley House; she was
desired to take into her family divers servants of the late Queen; to
maintain them the King has assigned her L5,000 a quarter.The frost and continual snow have now lasted five
weeks.Lord Spencer married the Duke of Newcastle's daughter,
and our neighbor, Mr.Hussey, married a daughter of my cousin, George
Evelyn, of Nutfield.The long frost intermitted, but not gone.Called to London by Lord Godolphin, one of the
Lords of the Treasury, offering me the treasurership of the hospital
designed to be built at Greenwich for worn-out seamen.The Marquis of Normanby told me King Charles had a
design to buy all King Street, and build it nobly, it being the street
leading to Westminster.This might have been done for the expense of the
Queen's funeral, which was L50,000, against her desire.Never was so universal a
mourning; all the Parliament men had cloaks given them, and four hundred
poor women; all the streets hung and the middle of the street boarded
and covered with black cloth.There were all the nobility, mayor,
aldermen, judges, etc.I supped at the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry's,
who related to me the pious behavior of the Queen in all her sickness,
which was admirable.She never inquired of what opinion persons were,
who were objects of charity; that, on opening a cabinet, a paper was
found wherein she had desired that her body might not be opened, or any
extraordinary expense at her funeral, whenever she should die.This
paper was not found in time to be observed.There were other excellent
things under her own hand, to the very least of her debts, which were
very small, and everything in that exact method, as seldom is found in
any private person.In sum, she was such an admirable woman, abating for
taking the Crown without a more due apology, as does, if possible, outdo
the renowned Queen Elizabeth.I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's with Lord Spencer.My Lord showed me his library, now again improved by many books bought
at the sale of Sir Charles Scarborough, an eminent physician, which was
the very best collection, especially of mathematical books, that was I
believe in Europe, once designed for the King's Library at St.James's;
but the Queen dying, who was the great patroness of that design, it was
let fall, and the books were miserably dissipated.The new edition of Camden's "Britannia" was now published (by Bishop
Gibson), with great additions; those to Surrey were mine, so that I had
one presented to me.of some parts of the New
Testament in vulgar Latin, that had belonged to a monastery in the North
of Scotland, which he esteemed to be about eight hundred years old;
there were some considerable various readings observable, as in John i.,
and genealogy of St.Duncomb, parson of this parish,
preached, which he hardly comes to above once a year though but seven or
eight miles off; a florid discourse, read out of his notes.The Holy
Sacrament followed, which he administered with very little reverence,
leaving out many prayers and exhortations; nor was there any oblation.This ought to be reformed, but my good brother did not well consider
when he gave away this living and the next [Abinger].The latter end of the month sharp and severely cold, with
much snow and hard frost; no appearance of spring.Lucas preached in the afternoon at Wotton.[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th April, 1695.Lord Halifax died suddenly at London, the day his
daughter was married to the Earl of Nottingham's son at Burleigh.Lord
H. was a very rich man, very witty, and in his younger days somewhat
positive.After a most severe, cold, and snowy winter, without
almost any shower for many months, the wind continuing N. and E. and not
a leaf appearing; the weather and wind now changed, some showers fell,
and there was a remission of cold.The spring begins to appear, yet the trees hardly
leafed.Sir T. Cooke discovers what prodigious bribes have been given by
some of the East India Company out of the stock, which makes a great
clamor.Never were so many private bills passed for unsettling estates,
showing the wonderful prodigality and decay of families.I came to Deptford from Wotton, in order to the first
meeting of the Commissioners for endowing an hospital for seamen at
Greenwich; it was at the Guildhall, London.Present, the Archbishop of
Canterbury, Lord Keeper, Lord Privy Seal, Lord Godolphin, Duke of
Shrewsbury, Duke of Leeds, Earls of Dorset and Monmouth, Commissioners
of the Admiralty and Navy, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir Christopher Wren, and
several more.Lowndes, Secretary to the
Lords of the Treasury, Surveyor-General.Second meeting of the Commissioners, and a committee
appointed to go to Greenwich to survey the place, I being one of them.We went to survey Greenwich, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir
Christopher Wren, Mr.Travers, the King's Surveyor, Captain Sanders, and
myself.We made report of the state of Greenwich house, and how
the standing part might be made serviceable at present for L6,000, and
what ground would be requisite for the whole design.My Lord Keeper
ordered me to prepare a book for subscriptions, and a preamble to it.Vanbrugh was made secretary to the
commission, by my nomination of him to the Lords, which was all done
that day.The commissioners met at Guildhall, when there were
scruples and contests of the Lord Mayor, who would not meet, not being
named as one of the quorum, so that a new commission was required,
though the Lord Keeper and the rest thought it too nice a punctilio.Met at Guildhall, but could do nothing for want of a
quorum.At Guildhall; account of subscriptions, about L7,000 or
L8,000.I dined at Lambeth, making my first visit to the
Archbishop, where there was much company, and great cheer.After prayers
in the evening, my Lord made me stay to show me his house, furniture,
and garden, which were all very fine, and far beyond the usual
Archbishops, not as affected by this, but being bought ready furnished
by his predecessor.We discoursed of several public matters,
particularly of the Princess of Denmark, who made so little figure.Met at Guildhall; not a full committee, so nothing
done.No sermon at church; but, after prayers, the names of
all the parishioners were read, in order to gathering the tax of 4s.for
marriages, burials, etc.A very imprudent tax, especially this reading
the names, so that most went out of the church.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

19th July, 1695.I dined at Sir Purbeck Temple's, near Croydon; his lady
is aunt to my son-in-law, Draper; the house exactly furnished.Went
thence with my son and daughter to Wotton.Duncomb,
parson of Albury, preached excellently.The weather now so cold, that greater frosts were not
always seen in the midst of winter; this succeeded much wet, and set
harvest extremely back.Offley preached at Abinger; too much
controversy on a point of no consequence, for the country people here.This was the first time I had heard him preach.Bombarding of Cadiz; a
cruel and brutish way of making war, first began by the French.The
season wet, great storms, unseasonable harvest weather.My good and
worthy friend, Captain Gifford, who that he might get some competence to
live decently, adventured all he had in a voyage of two years to the
East Indies, was, with another great ship, taken by some French
men-of-war, almost within sight of England, to the loss of near L70,000,
to my great sorrow, and pity of his wife, he being also a valiant and
industrious man.The losses of this sort to the nation have been
immense, and all through negligence, and little care to secure the same
near our own coasts; of infinitely more concern to the public than
spending their time in bombarding and ruining two or three paltry towns,
without any benefit, or weakening our enemies, who, though they began,
ought not to be imitated in an action totally averse to humanity, or
Christianity.Sir Purbeck Temple, uncle to my
son Draper, died suddenly.His lady being
own aunt to my son Draper, he hopes for a good fortune, there being no
heir.There had been a new meeting of the commissioners about Greenwich
hospital, on the new commission, where the Lord Mayor, etc.appeared,
but I was prevented by indisposition from attending.The weather very
sharp, winter approaching apace.The King went a progress into the
north, to show himself to the people against the elections, and was
everywhere complimented, except at Oxford, where it was not as he
expected, so that he hardly stopped an hour there, and having seen the
theater, did not receive the banquet proposed.Paul's school, who showed me many curious passages out of some
ancient Platonists' MSS.concerning the Trinity, which this great and
learned person would publish, with many other rare things, if he was
encouraged, and eased of the burden of teaching.The Archbishop and myself went to Hammersmith, to
visit Sir Samuel Morland, who was entirely blind; a very mortifying
sight.He showed us his invention of writing, which was very ingenious;
also his wooden calendar, which instructed him all by feeling; and other
pretty and useful inventions of mills, pumps, etc., and the pump he had
erected that serves water to his garden, and to passengers, with an
inscription, and brings from a filthy part of the Thames near it a most
perfect and pure water.He had newly buried L200 worth of music books
six feet under ground, being, as he said, love songs and vanity.He
plays himself psalms and religious hymns on the theorbo.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th November, 1695.Stanhope, Vicar of Lewisham, preached at
Whitehall.He is one of the most accomplished preachers I ever heard,
for matter, eloquence, action, voice, and I am told, of excellent
conversation.Famous fireworks and very chargeable, the King
being returned from his progress.He stayed seven or eight days at Lord
Sunderland's at Althorpe, where he was mightily entertained.These
fireworks were shown before Lord Romney, master of the ordnance, in St.James's great square, where the King stood.I spoke to the Archbishop of Canterbury to interest
himself for restoring a room belonging to St.James's library, where the
books want place.Williams continued in Boyle's
lectures another year.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, now the great favorite
and underhand politician, but not adventuring on any character, being
obnoxious to the people for having twice changed his religion.The Parliament wondrously intent on ways to reform
the coin; setting out a Proclamation prohibiting the currency of
half-crowns, etc., which made much confusion among the people.Hitherto mild, dark, misty, weather.Great confusion and distraction by reason of the
clipped money, and the difficulty found in reforming it.An extraordinary wet season, though temperate as to
cold.The "Royal Sovereign" man-of-war burned at Chatham.It was built
in 1637, and having given occasion to the levy of ship money was perhaps
the cause of all the after troubles to this day.An earthquake in
Dorsetshire by Portland, or rather a sinking of the ground suddenly for
a large space, near the quarries of stone, hindering the conveyance of
that material for the finishing St.There was now a conspiracy of about thirty
knights, gentlemen, captains, many of them Irish and English <DW7>s,
and Nonjurors or Jacobites (so called), to murder King William on the
first opportunity of his going either from Kensington, or to hunting, or
to the chapel; and upon signal of fire to be given from Dover Cliff to
Calais, an invasion was designed.In order to it there was a great army
in readiness, men-of-war and transports, to join a general insurrection
here, the Duke of Berwick having secretly come to London to head them,
King James attending at Calais with the French army.It was discovered
by some of their own party.L1,000 reward was offered to whoever could
apprehend any of the thirty named.Most of those who were engaged in it,
were taken and secured.The Parliament, city, and all the nation,
congratulate the discovery; and votes and resolutions were passed that,
if King William should ever be assassinated, it should be revenged on
the <DW7>s and party through the nation; an Act of Association drawing
up to empower the Parliament to sit on any such accident, till the Crown
should be disposed of according to the late settlement at the
Revolution.All <DW7>s, in the meantime, to be banished ten miles from
London.This put the nation into an incredible disturbance and general
animosity against the French King and King James.The militia of the
nation was raised, several regiments were sent for out of Flanders, and
all things put in a posture to encounter a descent.This was so timed by
the enemy, that while we were already much discontented by the greatness
of the taxes, and corruption of the money, etc., we had like to have had
very few men-of-war near our coasts; but so it pleased God that Admiral
Rooke wanting a wind to pursue his voyage to the Straits, that squadron,
with others at Portsmouth and other places, were still in the Channel,
and were soon brought up to join with the rest of the ships which could
be got together, so that there is hope this plot may be broken.I look
on it as a very great deliverance and prevention by the providence of
God.Though many did formerly pity King James's condition, this design
of assassination and bringing over a French army, alienated many oL his
friends, and was likely to produce a more perfect establishment of King
William.The wind continuing N. and E. all this week, brought so
many of our men-of-war together that, though most of the French finding
their design detected and prevented, made a shift to get into Calais and
Dunkirk roads, we wanting fire-ships and bombs to disturb them; yet they
were so engaged among the sands and flats, that 'tis said they cut their
masts and flung their great guns overboard to lighten their vessels.French were to
have invaded at once England, Scotland, and Ireland.Divers of the conspirators tried and condemned.Vesuvius breaking out, terrified Naples.Three of the unhappy wretches,
whereof one was a priest, were executed[82] for intending to assassinate
the King; they acknowledged their intention, but acquitted King James of
inciting them to it, and died very penitent.Divers more in danger, and
some very considerable persons.[Footnote 82: Robert Charnock, Edward King, and Thomas Keys.][Sidenote: LONDON]

6th April, 1696.The quarters of Sir William Perkins and Sir John
Friend, lately executed on the plot, with Perkins's head, were set up at
Temple Bar, a dismal sight, which many pitied.I think there never was
such at Temple Bar till now, except once in the time of King Charles
II., namely, of Sir Thomas Armstrong.[83]

    [Footnote 83: He was concerned in the Rye-House plot, fled into
    Holland, was given up, and executed in his own country, 1684.Great offense taken at the three ministers who
absolved Sir William Perkins and Friend at Tyburn.One of them (Snatt)
was a son of my old schoolmaster.This produced much altercation as to
the canonicalness of the action.We had a meeting at Guildhall of the grand committee
about settling the draught of Greenwich hospital.I went to Eton, and dined with Dr.The schoolmaster assured me there had not been for twenty years
a more pregnant youth in that place than my grandson.I went to see the
King's House at Kensington.The
gallery furnished with the best pictures [from] all the houses, of
Titian, Raphael, Correggio, Holbein, Julio Romano, Bassan, Vandyke,
Tintoretto, and others; a great collection of porcelain; and a pretty
private library.His prayer before
the sermon was one of the most excellent compositions I ever heard.The Venetian Ambassador made a stately entry with
fifty footmen, many on horseback, four rich coaches, and a numerous
train of gallants.Oates
dedicated a most villainous, reviling book against King James, which he
presumed to present to King William, who could not but abhor it,
speaking so infamously and untruly of his late beloved Queen's own
father.I dined at Lambeth, being summoned to meet my co-trustees,
the Archbishop, Sir Henry Ashurst, and Mr.Serjeant Rotheram, to consult
about settling Mr.Boyle's lecture for a perpetuity; which we concluded
upon, by buying a rent charge of L50 per annum, with the stock in our
hands.I went to Lambeth, to meet at dinner the Countess of
Sunderland and divers ladies.We dined in the Archbishop's wife's
apartment with his Grace, and stayed late; yet I returned to Deptford at
night.I went to London to meet my son, newly come from
Ireland, indisposed.Money still continuing exceedingly scarce, so that
none was paid or received, but all was on trust, the mint not supplying
for common necessities.The Association with an oath required of all
lawyers and officers, on pain of _praemunire_, whereby men were obliged
to renounce King James as no rightful king, and to revenge King
William's death, if happening by assassination.This to be taken by all
the Counsel by a day limited, so that the Courts of Chancery and King's
Bench hardly heard any cause in Easter Term, so many crowded to take the
oath.This was censured as a very entangling contrivance of the
Parliament in expectation, that many in high office would lay down, and
others surrender.Many gentlemen taken up on suspicion of the late plot,
were now discharged out of prison.We settled divers offices, and other matters relating to
workmen, for the beginning of Greenwich hospital.[Sidenote: DEPTFORD]

1st June, 1696.I went to Deptford to dispose of our goods, in order to
letting the house for three years to Vice Admiral Benbow, with condition
to keep up the garden.A committee met at Whitehall about Greenwich Hospital,
at Sir Christopher Wren's, his Majesty's Surveyor-General.We made the
first agreement with divers workmen and for materials; and gave the
first order for proceeding on the foundation, and for weekly payments to
the workmen, and a general account to be monthly.Dined at Lord Pembroke's, Lord Privy Seal, a very
worthy gentleman.He showed me divers rare pictures of very many of the
old and best masters, especially one of M. Angelo of a man gathering
fruit to give to a woman, and a large book of the best drawings of the
old masters.Sir John Fenwick, one of the conspirators, was taken.Great
subscriptions in Scotland to their East India Company.Want of current
money to carry on the smallest concerns, even for daily provisions in
the markets.Guineas lowered to twenty-two shillings, and great sums
daily transported to Holland, where it yields more, with other treasure
sent to pay the armies, and nothing considerable coined of the new and
now only current stamp, cause such a scarcity that tumults are every day
feared, nobody paying or receiving money; so imprudent was the late
Parliament to condemn the old though clipped and corrupted, till they
had provided supplies.To this add the fraud of the bankers and
goldsmiths, who having gotten immense riches by extortion, keep up their
treasure in expectation of enhancing its value.Duncombe, not long since
a mean goldsmith, having made a purchase of the late Duke of
Buckingham's estate at nearly L90,000, and reputed to have nearly as
much in cash.Banks and lotteries every day set up.The famous trial between my Lord Bath and Lord Montague
for an estate of L11,000 a year, left by the Duke of Albemarle, wherein
on several trials had been spent,L20,000 between them.The Earl of Bath
was cast on evident forgery.I made my Lord Cheney a visit at Chelsea, and saw those
ingenious waterworks invented by Mr.Winstanley, wherein were some
things very surprising and extraordinary.An exceedingly rainy, cold, unseasonable summer, yet
the city was very healthy.A trial in the Common Pleas between the Lady Purbeck
Temple and Mr.Temple, a nephew of Sir Purbeck, concerning a deed set up
to take place of several wills.The
cause went on my lady's side.This concerning my son-in-law, Draper, I
stayed almost all day at Court.A great supper was given to the jury,
being persons of the best condition in Buckinghamshire.I went with a select committee of the Commissioners for
Greenwich Hospital, and with Sir Christopher Wren, where with him I laid
the first stone of the intended foundation, precisely at five o'clock in
the evening, after we had dined together.Flamstead, the King's
Astronomical Professor, observing the punctual time by instruments.Note that my Lord Godolphin was the first of the
subscribers who paid any money to this noble fabric.A northern wind altering the weather with a continual
and impetuous rain of three days and nights changed it into perfect
winter.So little money in the nation that Exchequer Tallies,
of which I had for L2,000 on the best fund in England, the Post Office,
nobody would take at 30 per cent discount.The Bank lending the L200,000 to pay the array in
Flanders, that had done nothing against the enemy, had so exhausted the
treasure of the nation, that one could not have borrowed money under 14
or 15 per cent on bills, or on Exchequer Tallies under 30 per cent.I went to Lambeth and dined with the
Archbishop, who had been at Court on the complaint against Dr.David's, who was suspended for simony.The
Archbishop told me how unsatisfied he was with the Canon law, and how
exceedingly unreasonable all their pleadings appeared to him.Fine seasonable weather, and a great harvest after a
cold, wet summer.I went to congratulate the marriage of a daughter
of Mr.Boscawen to the son of Sir Philip Meadows; she is niece to my
Lord Godolphin, married at Lambeth by the Archbishop, 30th of August.After above six months' stay in London about Greenwich Hospital, I
returned to Wotton.Unseasonable stormy weather, and an ill seedtime.Lord Godolphin retired from the Treasury, who was the
first Commissioner and most skillful manager of all.The first frost began fiercely, but lasted not long.15th-23d November, 1696.Very stormy weather, rain, and inundations.The severe frost and weather relented, but again
froze with snow.Sir John
Fenwick was beheaded.Soldiers in the
armies and garrison towns frozen to death on their posts.I came to Wotton after three months' absence.Very bright weather, but with sharp east wind.My son
came from London in his melancholy indisposition.Duncombe, the rector, came and preached after
an absence of two years, though only living seven or eight miles off [at
Ashted].So great were the storms all this week, that near a
thousand people were lost going into the Texel.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th November, 1697.The King's entry very pompous; but is nothing
approaching that of King Charles II.Thanksgiving Day for the Peace, the King and a great
Court at Whitehall.The Bishop of Salisbury preached, or rather made a
florid panegyric, on 2 Chron.The evening concluded with
fireworks and illuminations of great expense.Paul's had had service
performed in it since it was burned in 1666.I went to Kensington with the Sheriff, Knights, and
chief gentlemen of Surrey, to present their address to the King.The
Duke of Norfolk promised to introduce it, but came so late, that it was
presented before be came.This insignificant ceremony was brought in in
Cromwell's time, and has ever since continued with offers of life and
fortune to whoever happened to have the power.I dined at Sir Richard
Onslow's, who treated almost all the gentlemen of Surrey.When we had
half dined, the Duke of Norfolk came in to make his excuse.At the Temple Church; it was very long before the
service began, staying for the Comptroller of the Inner Temple, where
was to be kept a riotous and reveling Christmas, according to custom.Bentley, about the Library at
St.A great Christmas kept at Wotton, open house, much company.I
presented my book of Medals, etc., to divers noblemen, before I exposed
it to sale.Fulham, who lately married my niece, preached
against atheism, a very eloquent discourse, somewhat improper for most
of the audience at [Wotton], but fitted for some other place, and very
apposite to the profane temper of the age.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th January, 1698.Whitehall burned, nothing but walls and ruins left.The imprisonment of the great banker, Duncombe:
censured by Parliament; acquitted by the Lords; sent again to the Tower
by the Commons.The Czar of Muscovy being come to England, and having a mind to see the
building of ships, hired my house at Sayes Court, and made it his court
and palace, newly furnished for him by the King.[84]

    [Footnote 84: While the Czar was in his house.Evelyn's servant
    writes to him: "There is a house full of people, and right nasty.The Czar lies next your library, and dines in the parlor next your
    study.He dines at ten o'clock and at six at night; is very seldom
    at home a whole day; very often in the King's yard, or by water,
    dressed in several dresses.The King is expected here this day; the
    best parlor is pretty clean for him to be entertained in.The King
    pays for all he has."]The Czar went from my house to return home.An
exceedingly sharp and cold season.An extraordinary great snow and frost, nipping the corn
and other fruits.Corn at nine shillings a bushel [L18 a load].Pepys's, where I heard the rare voice of
Mr.Pule, who was lately come from Italy, reputed the most excellent
singer we had ever had.White, late Bishop of Norwich, who had been ejected
for not complying with Government, was buried in St.Gregory's
churchyard, or vault, at St.His hearse was accompanied by two
non-juror bishops, Dr.Lloyd, with forty other
non-juror clergymen, who would not stay the Office of the burial,
because the Dean of St.Paul's had appointed a conforming minister to
read the Office; at which all much wondered, there being nothing in that
Office which mentioned the present King.Godolphin
with the Earl of Marlborough's daughter.To Deptford, to see how miserably the Czar had left my
house, after three months making it his Court.I got Sir Christopher
Wren, the King's surveyor, and Mr.London, his gardener, to go and
estimate the repairs, for which they allowed L150 in their report to the
Lords of the Treasury.I then went to see the foundation of the Hall and
Chapel at Greenwich Hospital.I dined with Pepys, where was Captain Dampier,[85] who
had been a famous buccaneer, had brought hither the painted Prince Job,
and printed a relation of his very strange adventure, and his
observations.He was now going abroad again by the King's encouragement,
who furnished a ship of 290 tons.He seemed a more modest man than one
would imagine by the relation of the crew he had assorted with.He
brought a map of his observations of the course of the winds in the
South Sea, and assured us that the maps hitherto extant were all false
as to the Pacific Sea, which he makes on the south of the line, that on
the north end running by the coast of Peru being extremely tempestuous.[Footnote 85: The celebrated navigator, born in 1652, the time of
    whose death is uncertain.His "Voyage Round the World" has gone
    through many editions, and the substance of it has been transferred
    to many collections of voyages.]Foy came to me to use my interest with Lord
Sunderland for his being made Professor of Physic at Oxford, in the
King's gift.I went also to the Archbishop in his behalf.Being one of the Council of the Royal Society, I was
named to be of the committee to wait on our new President, the Lord
Chancellor, our Secretary, Dr.Sloane, and Sir R. Southwell, last
Vice-President, carrying our book of statutes; the office of the
President being read, his Lordship subscribed his name, and took the
oaths according to our statutes as a Corporation for the improvement of
natural knowledge.Then his Lordship made a short compliment concerning
the honor the Society had done him, and how ready he would be to promote
so noble a design, and come himself among us, as often as the attendance
on the public would permit; and so we took our leave.She was daughter to Sir
John Evelyn, of Wilts, my father's nephew; she was widow to William
Pierrepoint, brother to the Marquis of Dorchester, and mother to Evelyn
Pierrepoint, Earl of Kingston; a most excellent and prudent lady.[Sidenote: LONDON]

The House of Commons persist in refusing more than 7,000 men to be a
standing army, and no strangers to be in the number.Our county member, Sir R. Onslow, opposed it also; which
might reconcile him to the people, who began to suspect him.Mander, the
Master of Baliol College, where he was entered a fellow-commoner.A most furious wind, such as has not happened for
many years, doing great damage to houses and trees, by the fall of which
several persons were killed.The old East India Company lost their business against
the new Company, by ten votes in Parliament, so many of their friends
being absent, going to see a tiger baited by dogs.The persecuted Vaudois, who were banished out of Savoy, were received by
the German Protestant Princes.My only remaining son died after a tedious languishing
sickness, contracted in Ireland, and increased here, to my exceeding
grief and affliction; leaving me one grandson, now at Oxford, whom I
pray God to prosper and be the support of the Wotton family.He was aged
forty-four years and about three months.He had been six years one of
the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland, with great ability and
reputation.After an extraordinary storm, there came up the Thames
a whale which was fifty-six feet long.Such, and a larger of the spout
kind, was killed there forty years ago (June 1658).My deceased son was buried in the vault at Wotton,
according to his desire.The Duke of Devon lost L1,900 at a horse race at Newmarket.The King preferring his young favorite Earl of Albemarle to be first
Commander of his Guard, the Duke of Ormond laid down his commission.This of the Dutch Lord passing over his head, was exceedingly resented
by everybody.Lord Spencer purchased an incomparable library[86] of...
wherein, among other rare books, were several that were printed at the
first invention of that wonderful art, as particularly "Tully's Offices,
etc."There was a Homer and a Suidas in a very good Greek character and
good paper, almost as ancient.This gentleman is a very fine scholar,
whom from a child I have known.[Footnote 86: The foundation of the noble library now at Blenheim.]I dined with the Archbishop; but my business was to
get him to persuade the King to purchase the late Bishop of Worcester's
library, and build a place for his own library at St.James's, in the
Park, the present one being too small.At a meeting of the Royal Society I was nominated to be of
the committee to wait on the Lord Chancellor to move the King to
purchase the Bishop of Worcester's library (Dr.The Court party have little influence in this Session.The Duke of Ormond restored to his commission.All
Lotteries, till now cheating the people, to be no longer permitted than
to Christmas, except that for the benefit of Greenwich Hospital.Bridgman, chairman of the committee for that charitable work, died; a
great loss to it.He was Clerk of the Council, a very industrious,
useful man.John Moore,[87] Bishop of Norwich,
one of the best and most ample collection of all sorts of good books in
England, and he, one of the most learned men.[Footnote 87: Afterward Bishop of Ely.He died 31st of July, 1714.King George I. purchased this library after the Bishop's death, for
    L6,000, and presented it to the University of Cambridge, where it
    now is.]After a long drought, we had a refreshing shower.The
day before, there was a dreadful fire at Rotherhithe, near the Thames
side, which burned divers ships, and consumed nearly three hundred
houses.Now died the famous Duchess of Mazarin; she had been the richest
lady in Europe.She was niece of Cardinal Mazarin, and was married to
the richest subject in Europe, as is said.She was born at Rome,
educated in France, and was an extraordinary beauty and wit but
dissolute and impatient of matrimonial restraint, so as to be abandoned
by her husband, and banished, when she came into England for shelter,
lived on a pension given her here, and is reported to have hastened her
death by intemperate drinking strong spirits.She has written her own
story and adventures, and so has her other extravagant sister, wife to
the noble family of Colonna.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th June, 1699.This week died Conyers Seymour, son of Sir Edward
Seymour, killed in a duel caused by a slight affront in St.James's
Park, given him by one who was envious of his gallantries; for he was a
vain, foppish young man, who made a great _eclat_ about town by his
splendid equipage and boundless expense.He was about twenty-three years
old; his brother, now at Oxford, inherited an estate of L7,000 a year,
which had fallen to him not two years before.My cousin, George Evelyn, of Nutfield, died suddenly.The heat has been so great, almost all this month, that
I do not remember to have felt much greater in Italy, and this after a
winter the wettest, though not the coldest, that I remember for fifty
years last past.Finding my occasions called me so often to London, I
took the remainder of the lease my son had in a house in Dover Street,
to which I now removed, not taking my goods from Wotton.Seasonable showers, after a continuance of excessive
drought and heat.At Deptford, they had
been building a pretty new church.David's [Watson]
deprived for simony.[88] The city of Moscow burnt by the throwing of
squibs.[Footnote 88: _Ante_, p.There was in this week an eclipse of the sun, at
which many were frightened by the predictions of the astrologers.I
remember fifty years ago that many were so terrified by Lilly, that they
dared not go out of their houses.A strange earthquake at New Batavia,
in the East Indies.My worthy brother died at Wotton, in the 83d year of
his age, of perfect memory and understanding.He was religious, sober,
and temperate, and of so hospitable a nature, that no family in the
county maintained that ancient custom of keeping, as it were, open house
the whole year in the same manner, or gave more noble or free
entertainment to the county on all occasions, so that his house was
never free.There were sometimes twenty persons more than his family,
and some that stayed there all the summer, to his no small expense; by
this he gained the universal love of the county.He was born at Wotton,
went from the free school at Guildford to Trinity College, Oxford,
thence to the Middle Temple, as gentlemen of the best quality did, but
without intention to study the law as a profession.He married the
daughter of Colwall, of a worthy and ancient family in Leicestershire,
by whom he had one son; she dying in 1643, left George her son an
infant, who being educated liberally, after traveling abroad, returned
and married one Mrs.Gore, by whom he had several children, but only
three daughters survived.He was a young man of good understanding, but,
over-indulging his ease and pleasure, grew so very corpulent, contrary
to the constitution of the rest of his father's relations, that he died.My brother afterward married a noble and honorable lady, relict of Sir
John Cotton, she being an Offley, a worthy and ancient Staffordshire
family, by whom he had several children of both sexes.This lady died,
leaving only two daughters and a son.The younger daughter died before
marriage; the other afterward married Sir Cyril Wych, a noble and
learned gentleman (son of Sir ---- Wych), who had been Ambassador at
Constantinople, and was afterward made one of the Lords Justices of
Ireland.Before this marriage, her only brother married the daughter of
---- Eversfield, of Sussex, of an honorable family, but left a widow
without any child living; he died about 1691, and his wife not many
years after, and my brother resettled the whole estate on me.His
sister, Wych, had a portion of L6,000, to which was added L300 more; the
three other daughters, with what I added, had about L5,000 each.My
brother died on the 5th of October, in a good old age and great
reputation, making his beloved daughter, Lady Wych, sole executrix,
leaving me only his library and some pictures of my father, mother, etc.She buried him with extraordinary solemnity, rather as a nobleman than
as a private gentleman.There were, as I computed, above 2,000 persons
at the funeral, all the gentlemen of the county doing him the last
honors.I returned to London, till my lady should dispose of herself and
family.After an unusual warm and pleasant season, we were
surprised with a very sharp frost.I presented my "_Acetaria_,"
dedicated to my Lord Chancellor, who returned me thanks in an
extraordinarily civil letter.There happened this week so thick a mist and fog,
that people lost their way in the streets, it being so intense that no
light of candles, or torches, yielded any (or but very little)
direction.Robberies were committed between
the very lights which were fixed between London and Kensington on both
sides, and while coaches and travelers were passing.It began about four
in the afternoon, and was quite gone by eight, without any wind to
disperse it.At the Thames, they beat drums to direct the watermen to
make the shore.At our chapel in the evening there was a sermon
preached by young Mr.Horneck, chaplain to Lord Guilford, whose lady's
funeral had been celebrated magnificently the Thursday before.A
panegyric was now pronounced, describing the extraordinary piety and
excellently employed life of this amiable young lady.She died in
childbed a few days before, to the excessive sorrow of her husband, who
ordered the preacher to declare that it was on her exemplary life,
exhortations and persuasion, that he totally changed the course of his
life, which was before in great danger of being perverted; following the
mode of this dissolute age.Her devotion, early piety, charity,
fastings, economy, disposition of her time in reading, praying,
recollections in her own handwriting of what she heard and read, and her
conversation were most exemplary.Blackwell's election to be the next
year's Boyles Lecturer.Such horrible robberies and murders were committed, as had not been
known in this nation; atheism, profaneness, blasphemy, among all sorts,
portended some judgment if not amended; on which a society was set on
foot, who obliged themselves to endeavor the reforming of it, in London
and other places, and began to punish offenders and put the laws in more
strict execution; which God Almighty prosper!A gentle, calm, dry,
temperate weather all this season of the year, but now came sharp, hard
frost, and mist, but calm.Calm, bright, and warm as in the middle of April.So
continued on 21st of January.[Sidenote: LONDON]

The Parliament reverses the prodigious donations of the Irish
forfeitures, which were intended to be set apart for discharging the
vast national debt.They called some great persons in the highest
offices in question for setting the Great Seal to the pardon of an
arch-pirate,[89] who had turned pirate again, and brought prizes into
the West Indies, suspected to be connived at on sharing the prey; but
the prevailing part in the House called Courtiers, out-voted the
complaints, not by being more in number, but by the country party being
negligent in attendance.[Footnote 89: Captain Kidd; he was hanged about two years afterward
    with some of his accomplices.This was one of the charges brought by
    the Commons against Lord Somers.]14th January, 1699-1700.Stringfellow, who had been made the first preacher at our chapel by
the Bishop of Lincoln [Dr.Tenison, now Archbishop], while he held St.Martin's by dispensation, and put in one Mr.Sandys, much against the
inclination of those who frequented the chapel.The Scotch book about
Darien was burned by the hangman by vote of Parliament.[90]

    [Footnote 90: The volume alluded to was "An Enquiry into the Causes
    of the Miscarriage of the Scots Colony at Darien: Or an Answer to a
    Libel," entitled "A Defense of the Scots abdicating Darien."See
    Votes of the House of Commons, 15th January, 1699-1700.]Died the Duke of Beaufort, a person of great honor,
prudence, and estate.I went to Wotton, the first time after my brother's
funeral, to furnish the house with necessaries, Lady Wych and my nephew
Glanville, the executors having sold and disposed of what goods were
there of my brother's.The weather was now altering into sharp and hard
frost.[Sidenote: LONDON]

One Stephens, who preached before the House of Commons on King Charles's
Martyrdom, told them that the observation of that day was not intended
out of any detestation of his murder, but to be a lesson to other Kings
and Rulers, how they ought to behave themselves toward their subjects,
lest they should come to the same end.This was so resented that, though
it was usual to desire these anniversary sermons to be printed, they
refused thanks to him, and ordered that in future no one should preach
before them, who was not either a Dean or a Doctor of Divinity.The Parliament voted against the Scots settling in
Darien as being prejudicial to our trade with Spain.They also voted
that the exorbitant number of attorneys be lessened (now indeed
swarming, and evidently causing lawsuits and disturbance, eating out the
estates of the people, provoking them to go to law).Mild and calm season, with gentle frost, and little
mizzling rain.Martin's frequently preached at Trinity
chapel in the afternoon.The season was like April for warmth and
mildness.--11th.On Wednesday, was a sermon at our chapel, to be
continued during Lent.I was at the funeral of my Lady Temple, who was buried
at Islington, brought from Addiscombe, near Croydon.She left my
son-in-law Draper (her nephew) the mansion house of Addiscombe, very
nobly and completely furnished, with the estate about it, with plate and
jewels, to the value in all of about L20,000.She was a very prudent
lady, gave many great legacies, with L500 to the poor of Islington,
where her husband, Sir Purbeck Temple, was buried, both dying without
issue.The season warm, gentle, and exceedingly pleasant.Divers persons of quality entered into the Society for Reformation[91]
of Manners; and some lectures were set up, particularly in the city of
London.The most eminent of the clergy preached at Bow Church, after
reading a declaration set forth by the King to suppress the growing
wickedness; this began already to take some effect as to common
swearing, and oaths in the mouths of people of all ranks.[Footnote 91: _Ante_, p.Burnet preached to-day before the Lord Mayor and a
very great congregation, on Proverbs xxvii.5, 6, "Open rebuke is better
than secret love; the wounds of a friend are better than the kisses of
an enemy."He made a very pathetic discourse concerning the necessity
and advantage of friendly correction.The Duke of Norfolk now succeeded in obtaining a divorce
from his wife by the Parliament for adultery with Sir John Germaine, a
Dutch gamester, of mean extraction, who had got much by gaming; the Duke
had leave to marry again, so that if he should have children, the
Dukedom will go from the late Lord Thomas's children, <DW7>s indeed,
but very hopeful and virtuous gentlemen, as was their father.The now
Duke their uncle is a Protestant.The Parliament nominated fourteen persons to go into Ireland as
commissioners to dispose of the forfeited estates there, toward payment
of the debts incurred by the late war, but which the King had in great
measure given to some of his favorites of both sexes, Dutch and others
of little merit, and very unseasonably.That this might be done without
suspicion of interest in the Parliament, it was ordered that no member
of either House should be in the commission.The great contest between
the Lords and Commons concerning the Lords' power of amendments and
rejecting bills tacked to the money bill, carried for the Commons.However, this tacking of bills is a novel practice, suffered by King
Charles II., who, being continually in want of money, let anything pass
rather than not have wherewith to feed his extravagance.This was
carried but by one voice in the Lords, all the Bishops following the
Court, save one; so that near sixty bills passed, to the great triumph
of the Commons and Country party, but high regret of the Court, and
those to whom the King had given large estates in Ireland.Pity it is,
that things should be brought to this extremity, the government of this
nation being so equally poised between King and subject; but we are
satisfied with nothing; and, while there is no perfection on this side
heaven, methinks both might be contented without straining things too
far.Among the rest, there passed a law as to <DW7>s' estates, that if
one turned not Protestant before eighteen years of age, it should pass
to his next Protestant heir.This indeed seemed a hard law, but not only
the usage of the French King to his Protestant subjects, but the
indiscreet insolence of the <DW7>s here, going in triumphant and public
processions with their Bishops, with banners and trumpets in divers
places (as is said) in the northern counties, has brought it on their
party.This week there was a great change of State officers.The Duke of Shrewsbury resigned his Lord Chamberlainship to the Earl of
Jersey, the Duke's indisposition requiring his retreat.Vernon,
Secretary of State, was put out.The Seal was taken from the Lord
Chancellor Somers, though he had been acquitted by a great majority of
votes for what was charged against him in the House of Commons.This
being in term time, put some stop to business, many eminent lawyers
refusing to accept the office, considering the uncertainty of things in
this fluctuating conjuncture.It is certain that this Chancellor was a
most excellent lawyer, very learned in all polite literature, a superior
pen, master of a handsome style, and of easy conversation; but he is
said to make too much haste to be rich, as his predecessor, and most in
place in this age did, to a more prodigious excess than was ever known.But the Commons had now so mortified the Court party, and property and
liberty were so much invaded in all the neighboring kingdoms, that their
jealousy made them cautious, and every day strengthened the law which
protected the people from tyranny.A most glorious spring, with hope of abundance of fruit of all kinds,
and a propitious year.The great trial between Sir Walter Clarges and Mr.Sherwin concerning the legitimacy of the late Duke of Albemarle, on
which depended an estate of L1,500 a year; the verdict was given for Sir
Walter, 19th.Serjeant Wright at last accepted the Great Seal.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

24th May, 1700.I went from Dover street to Wotton, for the rest of the
summer, and removed thither the rest of my goods from Sayes Court.A sweet season, with a mixture of refreshing showers.In the afternoon, our clergyman had a catechism,
which was continued for some time.I was visited with illness, but it pleased God that I
recovered, for which praise be ascribed to him by me, and that he has
again so graciously advertised me of my duty to prepare for my latter
end, which at my great age, cannot be far off.The Duke of Gloucester, son of the Princess Anne of Denmark, died of the
smallpox.I went to Harden, which was originally a barren warren
bought by Sir Robert Clayton, who built there a pretty house, and made
such alteration by planting not only an infinite store of the best
fruit; but so changed the natural situation of the hill, valleys, and
solitary mountains about it, that it rather represented some foreign
country, which would produce spontaneously pines, firs, cypress, yew,
holly, and juniper; they were come to their perfect growth, with walks,
mazes, etc., among them, and were preserved with the utmost care, so
that I who had seen it some years before in its naked and barren
condition, was in admiration of it.The land was bought of Sir John
Evelyn, of Godstone, and was thus improved for pleasure and retirement
by the vast charge and industry of this opulent citizen.He and his lady
received us with great civility.The tombs in the church at Croydon of
Archbishops Grindal, Whitgift, and other Archbishops, are fine and
venerable; but none comparable to that of the late Archbishop Sheldon,
which, being all of white marble, and of a stately ordinance and
carvings, far surpassed the rest, and I judge could not cost less than
L700 or L800.I went to Beddington, the ancient seat of the
Carews, in my remembrance a noble old structure, capacious, and in form
of the buildings of the age of Henry VIII.and Queen Elizabeth, and
proper for the old English hospitality, but now decaying with the house
itself, heretofore adorned with ample gardens, and the first orange
trees[92] that had been seen in England, planted in the open ground, and
secured in winter only by a tabernacle of boards and stoves removable in
summer, that, standing 120 years, large and goodly trees, and laden with
fruit, were now in decay, as well as the grotto, fountains, cabinets,
and other curiosities in the house and abroad, it being now fallen to a
child under age, and only kept by a servant or two from utter
dilapidation.The estate and park about it also in decay.[Footnote 92: Oranges were eaten in this kingdom much earlier than
    the time of King James I.]Pepys at Clapham, where he has
a very noble and wonderfully well-furnished house, especially with
Indian and Chinese curiosities.The offices and gardens well
accommodated for pleasure and retirement.My birthday now completed the 80th year of my age.I
with my soul render thanks to God, who, of his infinite mercy, not only
brought me out of many troubles, but this year restored me to health,
after an ague and other infirmities of so great an age; my sight,
hearing, and other senses and faculties tolerable, which I implore him
to continue, with the pardon of my sins past, and grace to acknowledge
by my improvement of his goodness the ensuing year, if it be his
pleasure to protract my life, that I may be the better prepared for my
last day, through the infinite merits of my blessed Savior, the Lord
Jesus, Amen!Came the news of my dear grandson (the only male of
my family now remaining) being fallen ill of the smallpox at Oxford,
which after the dire effects of it in my family exceedingly afflicted
me; but so it pleased my most merciful God that being let blood at his
first complaint, and by the extraordinary care of Dr.Mander (Head of
the college and now Vice Chancellor), who caused him to be brought and
lodged in his own bed and bedchamber, with the advice of his physician
and care of his tutor, there were all fair hopes of his recovery, to our
infinite comfort.We had a letter every day either from the Vice
Chancellor himself, or his tutor.Assurance of his recovery by a letter from himself.[Sidenote: LONDON]

There was a change of great officers at Court.Lord Godolphin returned
to his former station of first Commissioner of the Treasury; Sir Charles
Hedges, Secretary of State.At the Royal Society, Lord Somers, the late
Chancellor, was continued President.Great alterations of officers at Court, and
elsewhere,--Lord Chief Justice Treby died; he was a learned man in his
profession, of which we have now few, never fewer; the Chancery
requiring so little skill in deep law-learning, if the practicer can
talk eloquently in that Court; so that probably few care to study the
law to any purpose.Lord Marlborough Master of the Ordnance, in place of
Lord Romney made Groom of the Stole.The Earl of Rochester goes Lord
Lieutenant to Ireland.I finished the sale of North Stoake in Sussex to
Robert Michell, Esq., appointed by my brother to be sold for payment of
portions to my nieces, and other incumbrances on the estate.An exceeding deep snow, and melted away as suddenly.Severe frost, and such a tempest as threw down many
chimneys, and did great spoil at sea, and blew down above twenty trees
of mine at Wotton.Harley, an able
gentleman, chosen.Our countryman, Sir Richard Onslow, had a party for
him.By an order of the House of Commons, I laid before
the Speaker the state of what had been received and paid toward the
building of Greenwich Hospital.Wye, Rector of Wotton, died, a very worthy good man.Bohun, a learned person and excellent preacher, who had been my
son's tutor, and lived long in my family.I let Sayes Court to Lord Carmarthen, son to the Duke
of Leeds.I went to the funeral of my sister Draper, who was
buried at Edmonton in great state.Davenant displeased the clergy
now met in Convocation by a passage in his book, p.A Dutch boy of about eight or nine years old was carried
about by his parents to show, who had about the iris of one eye the
letters of _Deus meus_, and of the other _Elohim_, in the Hebrew
character.How this was done by artifice none could imagine; his parents
affirming that he was so born.It did not prejudice his sight, and he
seemed to be a lively playing boy.Everybody went to see him; physicians
and philosophers examined it with great accuracy; some considered it as
artificial, others as almost supernatural.The Duke of Norfolk died of an apoplexy, and Mr.Thomas
Howard of complicated disease since his being cut for the stone; he was
one of the Tellers of the Exchequer.Some Kentish men, delivering a petition to the House of
Commons, were imprisoned.[93]

    [Footnote 93: Justinian Champneys, Thomas Culpepper, William
    Culpepper, William Hamilton, and David Polhill, gentlemen of
    considerable property and family in the county.There is a very good
    print of them in five ovals on one plate, engraved by R. White, in
    1701.They desired the Parliament to mind the public more, and their
    private heats less.They were confined till the prorogation, and
    were much visited.A great dearth, no considerable rain having fallen for some months.Very plentiful showers, the wind coming west and south.The Bishops and Convocation at difference concerning the right of
calling the assembly and dissolving.[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th June, 1701.The Commons demanded a conference with the Lords on the
trial of Lord Somers, which the Lords refused, and proceeding on the
trial, the Commons would not attend, and he was acquitted.I went to congratulate the arrival of that worthy and
excellent person my Lord Galway, newly come out of Ireland, where he had
behaved himself so honestly, and to the exceeding satisfaction of the
people: but he was removed thence for being a Frenchman, though they had
not a more worthy, valiant, discreet, and trusty person in the two
kingdoms, on whom they could have relied for his conduct and fitness.He
was one who had deeply suffered, as well as the Marquis, his father, for
being Protestants.My Lord Treasurer made my grandson one of the Commissioners
of the prizes, salary L500 per annum.My grandson went to Sir Simon Harcourt, the
Solicitor-General, to Windsor, to wait on my Lord Treasurer.There had
been for some time a proposal of marrying my grandson to a daughter of
Mrs.Boscawen, sister of my Lord Treasurer, which was now far advanced.I subscribed toward rebuilding Oakwood Chapel, now,
after 200 years, almost fallen down.The weather changed from heat not much less than in Italy
or Spain for some few days, to wet, dripping, and cold, with
intermissions of fair.I went to Kensington, and saw the house,
plantations, and gardens, the work of Mr.Wise, who was there to receive
me.The death of King James, happening on the 15th of this month, N. S.,
after two or three days' indisposition, put an end to that unhappy
Prince's troubles, after a short and unprosperous reign, indiscreetly
attempting to bring in Popery, and make himself absolute, in imitation
of the French, hurried on by the impatience of the Jesuits; which the
nation would not endure.Died the Earl of Bath, whose contest with Lord Montague about the Duke
of Albemarle's estate, claiming under a will supposed to have been
forged, is said to have been worth L10,000 to the lawyers.His eldest
son shot himself a few days after his father's death; for what cause is
not clear.He was a most hopeful young man, and had behaved so bravely
against the Turks at the siege of Vienna, that the Emperor made him a
Count of the Empire.It was falsely reported that Sir Edward Seymour was
dead, a great man; he had often been Speaker, Treasurer of the Navy, and
in many other lucrative offices.He was of a hasty spirit, not at all
sincere, but head of the party at any time prevailing in Parliament.I kept my first courts in Surrey, which took up
the whole week.Hervey, a Counsellor, Justice of
Peace, and Member of Parliament, and my neighbor.I gave him six
guineas, which was a guinea a day, and to Mr.Martin, his clerk, three
guineas.I was this day 81 complete, in tolerable health,
considering my great age.I gave my vote and
interest to Sir R. Onslow and Mr.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st January, 1701-02.At the Royal Society there was read and approved
the delineation and description of my Tables of Veins and Arteries, by
Mr.Cooper, the chirurgeon, in order to their being engraved.The King had a fall from his horse, and broke his
collar bone, and having been much indisposed before, and aguish, with a
long cough and other weakness, died this Sunday morning, about four
o'clock.I carried my accounts of Greenwich Hospital to the Committee.My brother-in-law, Glanville, departed this life this
morning after a long languishing illness, leaving a son by my sister,
and two granddaughters.Our relation and friendship had been long and
great.He died in the 84th year of his
age, and willed his body to be wrapped in lead and carried down to
Greenwich, put on board a ship, and buried in the sea, between Dover and
Calais, about the Goodwin sands; which was done on the Tuesday, or
Wednesday after.This occasioned much discourse, he having no relation
at all to the sea.He was a gentleman of an ancient family in
Devonshire, and married my sister Jane.By his prudent parsimony he much
improved his fortune.He had a place in the Alienation Office, and might
have been an extraordinary man, had he cultivated his parts.My steward at Wotton gave a very honest account of what he had laid out
on repairs, amounting to L1,900.The report of the committee sent to examine the state of
Greenwich hospital was delivered to the House of Commons, much to their
satisfaction.Being elected a member of the Society lately incorporated for the
propagation of the Gospel in foreign parts, I subscribed L10 per annum
toward the carrying it on.We agreed that every missioner, besides the
L20 to set him forth, should have L50 per annum out of the stock of the
Corporation, till his settlement was worth to him L100 per annum.We
sent a young divine to New York.I dined at the Archbishop's with the newly made Bishop
of Carlisle, Dr.Nicolson, my worthy and learned correspondent.I went to Wotton with my family for the rest of the
summer, and my son-in-law, Draper, with his family, came to stay with
us, his house at Addiscombe being new-building, so that my family was
above thirty.Most of the new Parliament were chosen of Church of
England principles, against the peevish party.The Queen was
magnificently entertained at Oxford and all the towns she passed through
on her way to Bath.Arrived now to the 82d year of my age, having read
over all that passed since this day twelvemonth in these notes, I render
solemn thanks to the Lord, imploring the pardon of my past sins, and the
assistance of his grace; making new resolutions, and imploring that he
will continue his assistance, and prepare me for my blessed Savior's
coming, that I may obtain a comfortable departure, after so long a term
as has been hitherto indulged me.I find by many infirmities this year
(especially nephritic pains) that I much decline; and yet of his
infinite mercy retain my intellect and senses in great measure above
most of my age.I have this year repaired much of the mansion house and
several tenants' houses, and paid some of my debts and engagements.My
wife, children, and family in health: for all which I most sincerely
beseech Almighty God to accept of these my acknowledgments, and that if
it be his holy will to continue me yet longer, it may be to the praise
of his infinite grace, and salvation of my soul.My kinsman, John Evelyn, of Nutfield, a young and
very hopeful gentleman, and Member of Parliament, after having come to
Wotton to see me, about fifteen days past, went to London and there died
of the smallpox.He left a brother, a commander in the army in Holland,
to inherit a fair estate.Our affairs in so prosperous a condition both by sea and land, that
there has not been so great an union in Parliament, Court, and people,
in memory of man, which God in mercy make us thankful for, and continue!The Bishop of Exeter preached before the Queen and both Houses of
Parliament at St.Paul's; they were wonderfully huzzaed in their
passage, and splendidly entertained in the city.The expectation now is, what treasure will be found on
breaking bulk of the galleon brought from Vigo by Sir George Rooke,
which being made up in an extraordinary manner in the hold, was not
begun to be opened till the fifth of this month, before two of the Privy
Council, two of the chief magistrates of the city, and the Lord
Treasurer.After the excess of honor conferred by the Queen on the Earl of
Marlborough, by making him a Knight of the Garter and a Duke, for the
success of but one campaign, that he should desire L5,000 a year to be
settled on him by Parliament out of the Post Office, was thought a bold
and unadvised request, as he had, besides his own considerable estate,
above L30,000 a year in places and employments, with L50,000 at
interest.He had married one daughter to the son of my Lord Treasurer
Godolphin, another to the Earl of Sunderland, and a third to the Earl of
Bridgewater.He is a very handsome person, well-spoken and affable, and
supports his want of acquired knowledge by keeping good company.News of Vice-Admiral Benbow's conflict with the French
fleet in the West Indies, in which he gallantly behaved himself, and was
wounded, and would have had extraordinary success, had not four of his
men-of-war stood spectators without coming to his assistance; for this,
two of their commanders were tried by a Council of War, and
executed;[94] a third was condemned to perpetual imprisonment, loss of
pay, and incapacity to serve in future.[Footnote 94: The Captains Kirby and Wade, having been tried and
    condemned to die by a court-martial held on them in the West Indies,
    were sent home in the "Bristol;" and, on its arrival at Portsmouth
    were both shot on board, not being suffered to land on English
    ground.]Oglethorpe (son of the late Sir Theo.fought on occasion of some words which passed at a committee of the
House.Oglethorpe was disarmed.The Bill against occasional
conformity was lost by one vote.Corn and provisions so cheap that the
farmers are unable to pay their rents.[Sidenote: LONDON]

February, 1703.A famous cause at the King's Bench between Mr.Fenwick
and his wife, which went for him with a great estate.The Duke of
Marlborough lost his only son at Cambridge by the smallpox.A great
earthquake at Rome, etc.A famous young woman, an Italian, was hired by
our comedians to sing on the stage, during so many plays, for which they
gave her L500; which part by her voice alone at the end of three scenes
she performed with such modesty and grace, and above all with such
skill, that there was never any who did anything comparable with their
voices.She was to go home to the Court of the King of Prussia, and I
believe carried with her out of this vain nation above L1,000, everybody
coveting to hear her at their private houses.Samuel Pepys, a very worthy,
industrious and curious person, none in England exceeding him in
knowledge of the navy, in which he had passed through all the most
considerable offices, Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of the Admiralty,
all which he performed with great integrity.went
out of England, he laid down his office, and would serve no more; but
withdrawing himself from all public affairs, he lived at Clapham with
his partner, Mr.Hewer, formerly his clerk, in a very noble house and
sweet place, where he enjoyed the fruit of his labors in great
prosperity.He was universally beloved, hospitable, generous, learned in
many things, skilled in music, a very great cherisher of learned men of
whom he had the conversation.His library and collection of other
curiosities were of the most considerable, the models of ships
especially.Besides what he published of an account of the navy, as he
found and left it, he had for divers years under his hand the History of
the Navy, or _Navalia_, as he called it; but how far advanced, and what
will follow of his, is left, I suppose, to his sister's son, Mr.Pepys had educated in all sorts of
useful learning, sending him to travel abroad, from whence he returned
with extraordinary accomplishments, and worthy to be heir.Pepys had
been for near forty years so much my particular friend, that Mr.Jackson
sent me complete mourning, desiring me to be one to hold up the pall at
his magnificent obsequies; but my indisposition hindered me from doing
him this last office.Rains have been great and continual, and now, near
midsummer, cold and wet.I went to Addiscombe, sixteen miles from Wotton, to
see my son-in-law's new house, the outside, to the coving, being such
excellent brickwork, based with Portland stone, with the pilasters,
windows, and within, that I pronounced it in all the points of good and
solid architecture to be one of the very best gentlemen's houses in
Surrey, when finished.I returned to Wotton in the evening, though
weary.The last week in this month an uncommon long-continued
rain, and the Sunday following, thunder and lightning.The new Commission for Greenwich hospital was sealed
and opened, at which my son-in-law, Draper, was present, to whom I
resigned my office of Treasurer.From August 1696, there had been
expended in building L89,364 14s.This day, being eighty-three years of age, upon
examining what concerned me, more particularly the past year, with the
great mercies of God preserving me, and in the same measure making my
infirmities tolerable, I gave God most hearty and humble thanks,
beseeching him to confirm to me the pardon of my sins past, and to
prepare me for a better life by the virtue of his grace and mercy, for
the sake of my blessed Savior.The wet and uncomfortable weather staying us from
church this morning, our Doctor officiated in my family; at which were
present above twenty domestics.55, 56, of the vanity of this world and uncertainty of life, and
the inexpressible happiness and satisfaction of a holy life, with
pertinent inferences to prepare us for death and a future state.I gave
him thanks, and told him I took it kindly as my funeral sermon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26-7th November, 1703.The effects of the hurricane and tempest of
wind, rain, and lightning, through all the nation, especially London,
were very dismal.As to my
own losses, the subversion of woods and timber, both ornamental and
valuable, through my whole estate, and about my house the woods crowning
the garden mount, the growing along the park meadow, the damage to my
own dwelling, farms, and outhouses, is almost tragical, not to be
paralleled, with anything happening in our age.I am not able to
describe it; but submit to the pleasure of Almighty God.I removed to Dover Street, where I found all well;
but houses, trees, garden, etc., at Sayes Court, suffered very much.I made up my accounts, paid wages, gave rewards and
New Year's gifts, according to custom.The King of Spain[95] landing at Portsmouth, came to
Windsor, where he was magnificently entertained by the Queen, and
behaved himself so nobly, that everybody was taken with his graceful
deportment.After two days, having presented the great ladies, and
others, with valuable jewels, he went back to Portsmouth, and
immediately embarked for Spain.[Footnote 95: Charles III., afterward Emperor of Germany, by the
    title of Charles VI.]The Lord Treasurer gave my grandson the office of
Treasurer of the Stamp Duties, with a salary of L300 a year.The fast on the Martyrdom of King Charles I. was
observed with more than usual solemnity.Bathurst, President of Trinity College, Oxford, now
died,[96] I think the oldest acquaintance now left me in the world.He
was eighty-six years of age, stark blind, deaf, and memory lost, after
having been a person of admirable parts and learning.This is a serious
alarm to me.He built a very handsome
chapel to the college, and his own tomb.He gave a legacy of money, and
a third part of his library, to his nephew, Dr.Bohun, who went hence to
his funeral.[Footnote 96: There is a very good Life of him, with his portrait
    prefixed, by Thomas Warton, Fellow of Trinity College, and Poetry
    Professor at Oxford.][Sidenote: LONDON]

7th September, 1704.This day was celebrated the thanksgiving for the
late great victory,[97] with the utmost pomp and splendor by the Queen,
Court, great Officers, Lords Mayor, Sheriffs, Companies, etc.The
streets were scaffolded from Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor presented
her Majesty with a sword, which she returned.Every company was ranged
under its banners, the city militia without the rails, which were all
hung with cloth suitable to the color of the banner.The Lord Mayor,
Sheriffs, and Aldermen were in their scarlet robes, with caparisoned
horses; the Knight Marshal on horseback; the Foot-Guards; the Queen in a
rich coach with eight horses, none with her but the Duchess of
Marlborough in a very plain garment, the Queen full of jewels.Music and
trumpets at every city company.The great officers of the Crown,
Nobility, and Bishops, all in coaches with six horses, besides
innumerable servants, went to St.After
this, the Queen went back in the same order to St.The city
companies feasted all the Nobility and Bishops, and illuminated at
night.Music for the church and anthems composed by the best masters.The day before was wet and stormy, but this was one of the most serene
and calm days that had been all the year.[Footnote 97: Over the French and Bavarians, at Blenheim, 13th
    August, 1704.]Being my birthday and the 84th year of my life,
after particular reflections on my concerns and passages of the year, I
set some considerable time of this day apart, to recollect and examine
my state and condition, giving God thanks, and acknowledging his
infinite mercies to me and mine, begging his blessing, and imploring his
protection for the year following.Lord Clarendon presented me with the three volumes of
his father's "History of the Rebellion."My Lord of Canterbury wrote to me for suffrage for Mr.Clarke's
continuance this year in the Boyle Lecture, which I willingly gave for
his excellent performance of this year.I went to wait on my Lord Treasurer, where was the
victorious Duke of Marlborough, who came to me and took me by the hand
with extraordinary familiarity and civility, as formerly he was used to
do, without any alteration of his good-nature.He had a most rich George
in a sardonyx set with diamonds of very great value; for the rest, very
plain.I had not seen him for some years, and believed he might have
forgotten me.Agues and smallpox much in
every place.Great loss by fire,
burning the outhouses and famous stable of the Earl of Nottingham, at
Burleigh [Rutlandshire], full of rich goods and furniture, by the
carelessness of a servant.A little before, the same happened at Lord
Pembroke's, at Wilton.The old Countess of Northumberland, Dowager of
Algernon Percy, Admiral of the fleet to King Charles I., died in the 83d
year of her age.She was sister to the Earl of Suffolk, and left a great
estate, her jointure to descend to the Duke of Somerset.On the death of the Emperor, there was no mourning worn at Court,
because there was none at the Imperial Court on the death of King
William.I went to see Sir John Chardin, at Turnham Green, the
gardens being very fine, and exceedingly well planted with fruit.Most extravagant expense to debauch and corrupt votes
for Parliament members.I sent my grandson with his party of my
freeholders to vote for Mr.I dined at Lambeth with the Archbishop of Dublin,
Dr.King, a sharp and ready man in politics, as well as very learned.We had long conversation about the philosopher's elixir,
which he believed attainable, and had seen projection himself by one who
went under the name of Mundanus, who sometimes came along among the
adepts, but was unknown as to his country, or abode; of this the doctor
had written a treatise in Latin, full of very astonishing relations.He
is a very learned person, formerly a Fellow of St.John's College,
Oxford, in which city he practiced physic, but has now altogether given
it over, and lives retired, being very old and infirm, yet continuing
chemistry.I went to Greenwich hospital, where they now began to take in wounded
and worn-out seamen, who are exceedingly well provided for.The
buildings now going on are very magnificent.[Sidenote: LONDON]

October, 1705.Observing how uncertain
great officers are of continuing long in their places, he would not
accept it, unless L2,000 a year were given him in reversion when he was
put out, in consideration of his loss of practice.His predecessors, how
little time soever they had the Seal, usually got L100,000 and made
themselves Barons.Lord Abington, Lieutenant
of the Tower, displaced, and General Churchill, brother to the Duke of
Marlborough, put in.An indication of great unsteadiness somewhere, but
thus the crafty Whig party (as called) begin to change the face of the
Court, in opposition to the High Churchmen, which was another
distinction of a party from the Low Churchmen.There had never been so great an assembly of members
on the first day of sitting, being more than 450.The votes both of the
old, as well as the new, fell to those called Low Churchmen, contrary to
all expectation.I am this day arrived to the 85th year of my age.Lord teach me so to number my days to come, that I may apply them to
wisdom!Making up my accounts for the past year, paid
bills, wages, and New Year's gifts, according to custom.Though much
indisposed and in so advanced a stage, I went to our chapel [in London]
to give God public thanks, beseeching Almighty God to assist me and my
family the ensuing year, if he should yet continue my pilgrimage here,
and bring me at last to a better life with him in his heavenly kingdom.Divers of our friends and relations dined with us this day.My indisposition increasing, I was exceedingly ill
this whole week.Notes of the sermons at the chapel in the morning and
afternoon, written with his own hand, conclude this Diary.[98]

The journey runs, after a few adventures, over into an elaborate
practical joke in which Pankraz himself is burlesqued by his
contemporaries.Timme carries his poignancy and keenness of satire over
into bluntness of burlesque blows in a large part of these closing
scenes.Pankraz loses the sympathy of the reader, involuntarily and
irresistibly conceded him, and becomes an inhuman freak of absurdity,
beyond our interest.[67]

Pankraz is brought into disaster by his slavish following of suggestions
aroused through fancied parallels between his own circumstances and
those related of Yorick.He finds a sorrowing woman[68] sitting, like
Maria of Moulines, beneath a poplar tree.Pankraz insists upon carrying
out this striking analogy farther, which the woman, though she betrays
no knowledge of the Sentimental Journey, is not loath to accede to, as
it coincides with her own nefarious purposes.Timme in the following
scene strikes a blow at the abjectly sensual involved in much of the
then sentimental, unrecognized and unrealized.Pankraz meets a man carrying a cage of monkeys.[69] He buys the poor
creatures from their master, even as Frau Kurt had purchased the goat.The similarity to the Starling narrative in Sterne’s volume fills
Pankraz’s heart with glee.The Starling wanted to get out and so do his
monkeys, and Pankraz’s only questions are: “What did Yorick do?” “What
would he do?” He resolves to do more than is recorded of Yorick, release
the prisoners at all costs.Yorick’s monolog occurs to him and he
parodies it.The animals greet their release in the thankless way
natural to them,--a point already enforced in the conduct of Frau Kurt’s
goat.In the last chapter of the third volume Sterne’s relationship to “Eliza”
is brought into the narrative.Pankraz writes a letter wherein he
declares amid exaggerated expressions of bliss that he has found
“Elisa,” his “Elisa.” This is significant as showing that the name Eliza
needed no further explanation, but, from the popularity of the
Yorick-Eliza letters and the wide-spread admiration of the relation, the
name Eliza was accepted as a type of that peculiar feminine relation
which existed between Sterne and Mrs.Draper, and which appealed to
Sterne’s admirers.Pankraz’s new Order of the Garter, born of his wild frenzy[70] of
devotion over this article of Elisa’s wearing apparel, is an open satire
on Leuchsenring’s and Jacobi’s silly efforts noted elsewhere.The garter
was to bear Elisa’s silhouette and the device “Orden vom Strumpfband der
empfindsamen Liebe.”

The elaborate division of moral preachers[71] into classes may be
further mentioned as an adaptation from Sterne, cast in Yorick’s
mock-scientific manner.A consideration of these instances of allusion and adaptation with a
view to classification, reveals a single line of demarkation obvious and
unaltered.And this line divides the references to Sterne’s sentimental
influence from those to his whimsicality of narration, his vagaries of
thought; that is, it follows inevitably, and represents precisely the
two aspects of Sterne as an individual, and as an innovator in the world
of letters.But that a line of cleavage is further equally discernible
in the treatment of these two aspects is not to be overlooked.On the
one hand is the exaggerated, satirical, burlesque; on the other the
modified, lightened, softened.And these two lines of division coincide
precisely.The slight touches of whimsicality, suggesting Sterne, are a part of
Timme’s own narrative, evidently adapted with approval and appreciation;
they are never carried to excess, satirized or burlesqued, but may be
regarded as purposely adopted, as a result of admiration and presumably
as a suggestion to the possible workings of sprightliness and grace on
the heaviness of narrative prose at that time.Timme, as a clear-sighted
contemporary, certainly confined the danger of Sterne’s literary
influence entirely to the sentimental side, and saw no occasion to
censure an importation of Sterne’s whimsies.Pank’s ode on the death of
Riepel, written partly in dashes and partly in exclamation points, is
not a disproof of this assertion.Timme is not satirizing Sterne’s
whimsical use of typographical signs, but rather the Germans who
misunderstood Sterne and tried to read a very peculiar and precious
meaning into these vagaries.The sentimental is, however, always
burlesqued and ridiculed; hence the satire is directed largely against
the Sentimental Journey, and Shandy is followed mainly in those
sections, which, we are compelled to believe, he wrote for his own
pleasure, and in which he was led on by his own interest.The satire on sentimentalism is purposeful, the imitation and adaptation
of the whimsical and original is half-unconscious, and bespeaks
admiration and commendation.Timme’s book was sufficiently popular to demand a second edition, but it
never received the critical examination its merits deserved.Wieland’s
_Teutscher Merkur_ and the _Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften_
ignore it completely.The _Gothaische Gelehrte Zeitungen_ announces the
book in its issue of August 2, 1780, but the book itself is not reviewed
in its columns.The _Jenaische Zeitungen von gelehrten Sachen_ accords
it a colorless and unappreciative review in which Timme is reproached
for lack of order in his work (a censure more applicable to the first
volume), and further for his treatment of German authors then
popular.[72] The latter statement stamps the review as unsympathetic
with Timme’s satirical purpose.In the _Erfurtische gelehrte
Zeitung_,[73] in the very house of its own publication, the novel is
treated in a long review which hesitates between an acknowledged lack of
comprehension and indignant denunciation.The reviewer fears that the
author is a “Pasquillant oder gar ein Indifferentist” and hopes the
public will find no pleasure (Geschmack) in such bitter jesting
(Schnaken).He is incensed at Timme’s contention that the Germans were
then degenerate as compared with their Teutonic forefathers, and Timme’s
attack on the popular writers is emphatically resented.“Aber nun kömmt
das Schlimme erst,” he says, “da führt er aus Schriften unserer grössten
Schenies, aus den Lieblings-büchern der Nazion, aus Werther’s Leiden,
dem Siegwart, den Fragmenten zur Geschichte der Zärtlichkeit, Müller’s
Freuden und Leiden, Klinger’s Schriften u.s.w.zur Bestätigung seiner
Behauptung, solche Stellen mit solcher Bosheit an, dass man in der That
ganz verzweifelt wird, ob sie von einem Schenie oder von einem Affen
geschrieben sind.”

In the number for July 6, 1782, the second and third volumes are
reviewed.Pity is expressed for the poor author, “denn ich fürchte es
wird sich ein solches Geschrey wider ihn erheben, wovon ihm die Ohren
gällen werden.” Timme wrote reviews for this periodical, and the general
tone of this notice renders it not improbable that he roguishly wrote
the review himself or inspired it, as a kind of advertisement for the
novel itself.It is certainly a challenge to the opposing party.The _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[74] alone seems to grasp the full
significance of the satire.“We acknowledge gladly,” says the reviewer,
“that the author has with accuracy noted and defined the rise,
development, ever-increasing contagion and plague-like prevalence of
this moral pestilence;.that the author has penetrated deep into
the knowledge of this disease and its causes.” He wishes for an
engraving of the Sterne hobby-horse cavalcade described in the first
chapter, and begs for a second and third volume, “aus deutscher
Vaterlandsliebe.” Timme is called “Our German Cervantes.”

The second and third volumes are reviewed[75] with a brief word of
continued approbation.A novel not dissimilar in general purpose, but less successful in
accomplishment, is Wezel’s “Wilhelmine Arend, oder die Gefahren der
Empfindsamkeit,” Dessau and Leipzig, 1782, two volumes.The book is more
earnest in its conception.Its author says in the preface that his
desire was to attack “Empfindsamkeit” on its dangerous and not on its
comic side, hence the book avoids in the main the lighthearted and
telling burlesque, the Hudibrastic satire of Timme’s novel.He works
along lines which lead through increasing trouble to a tragic
_dénouement_.The preface contains a rather elaborate classification of kinds of
“Empfindsamkeit,” which reminds one of Sterne’s mock-scientific
discrimination.This classification is according to temperament,
education, example, custom, reading, strength or weakness of the
imagination; there is a happy, a sad, a gentle, a vehement, a dallying,
a serious, a melancholy, sentimentality, the last being the most poetic,
the most perilous.The leading character, Wilhelmine, is, like most characters which are
chosen and built up to exemplify a preconceived theory, quite
unconvincing.In his foreword Wezel analyzes his heroine’s character and
details at some length the motives underlying the choice of attributes
and the building up of her personality.This insight into the author’s
scaffolding, this explanation of the mechanism of his puppet-show, does
not enhance the aesthetic, or the satirical force of the figure.She is
not conceived in flesh and blood, but is made to order.The story begins in letters,--a method of story-telling which was the
legacy of Richardson’s popularity--and this device is again employed in
the second volume (Part VII).Wilhelmine Arend is one of those whom
sentimentalism seized like a maddening pestiferous disease.We read of
her that she melted into tears when her canary bird lost a feather, that
she turned white and trembled when Dr.Braun hacked worms to pieces in
conducting a biological experiment.On one occasion she refused to drive
home, as this would take the horses out in the noonday sun and disturb
their noonday meal,--an exorbitant sympathy with brute creation which
owes its popularity to Yorick’s ass.It is not necessary here to relate
the whole story.Wilhelmine’s excessive sentimentality estranges her
from her husband, a weak brutish man, who has no comprehension of her
feelings.He finds a refuge in the debasing affections of a French
opera-singer, Pouilly, and gradually sinks to the very lowest level of
degradation.This all is accomplished by the interposition and active
concern of friends, by efforts at reunion managed by benevolent
intriguers and kindly advisers.Braun and Irwin is especially significant in its sane
characterization of Wilhelmine’s mental disorders, and the observations
upon “Empfindsamkeit” which are scattered through the book are
trenchant, and often markedly clever.Wilhelmine holds sentimental
converse with three kindred spirits in succession, Webson, Dittmar, and
Geissing.The first reads touching tales aloud to her and they two unite
their tears, a sentimental idea dating from the Maria of Moulines
episode.The part which the physical body, with its demands and desires
unacknowledged and despised, played as the unseen moving power in these
three friendships is clearly and forcefully brought out.Allusion to
Timme’s elucidation of this principle, which, though concealed, underlay
much of the sentimentalism of this epoch, has already been made.Finally
Wilhelmine is persuaded by her friends to leave her husband, and the
scene is shifted to a little Harz village, where she is married to
Webson; but the unreasonableness of her nature develops inordinately,
and she is unable ever to submit to any reasonable human relations, and
the rest of the tale is occupied with her increasing mental aberration,
her retirement to a hermit-like seclusion, and her death.The book, as has been seen, presents a rather pitiful satire on the
whole sentimental epoch, not treating any special manifestation, but
applicable in large measure equally to those who joined in expressing
the emotional ferment to which Sterne, “Werther” and “Siegwart” gave
impulse, and for which they secured literary recognition.Wezel fails as
a satirist, partly because his leading character is not convincing, but
largely because his satirical exaggeration, and distortion of
characteristics, which by a process of selection renders satire
efficient, fails to make the exponent of sentimentalism ludicrous, but
renders her pitiful.At the same time this satirical warping impairs the
value of the book as a serious presentation of a prevailing malady.A precursor of “Wilhelmine Arend” from Wezel’s own hand was “Die
unglückliche Schwäche,” which was published in the second volume of his
“Satirische Erzählungen.”[76] In this book we have a character with a
heart like the sieve of the Danaids, and to Frau Laclerc is attributed
“an exaggerated softness of heart which was unable to resist a single
impression, and was carried away at any time, wherever the present
impulse bore it.” The plot of the story, with the intrigues of Graf.Z.,
the Pouilly of the piece, the separation of husband and wife, their
reunion, the disasters following directly in the train of weakness of
heart in opposing sentimental attacks, are undoubtedly children of the
same purpose as that which brought forth “Wilhelmine Arend.”

Another satirical protest was, as one reads from a contemporary review,
“Die Tausend und eine Masche, oder Yoricks wahres Shicksall, ein blaues
Mährchen von Herrn Stanhope” (1777, 8vo).The book purports to be the
posthumous work of a young Englishman, who, disgusted with Yorick’s
German imitators, grew finally indignant with Yorick himself.The
_Almanach der deutschen Musen_ (1778, pp.99-100) finds that the author
misjudges Yorick.The book is written in part if not entirely in verse.In 1774 a correspondent of Wieland’s _Merkur_ writes, begging this
authoritative periodical to condemn a weekly paper just started in
Prague, entitled “Wochentlich Etwas,” which is said to be written in the
style of Tristram Shandy and the Sentimental Journey, M . . .and “die Beyträge zur Geheimen Geschichte des menschlichen Herzens und
Verstandes,” and thereby is a shame to “our dear Bohemia.”

In this way it is seen how from various sources and in various ways
protest was made against the real or distorted message of Laurence
Sterne.[Footnote 2: 1772, July 7.][Footnote 3: See Erich Schmidt’s “Heinrich Leopold Wagner,
    Goethe’s Jugendgenosse,” 2d edition, Jena, 1879, p. 82.][Footnote 4: Berlin, 1779, pp.[Footnote 5: XLIV, 1, p.[Footnote 6: Probably Ludwig Heinrich von Nicolay, the poet and

    that the underlying thought of Musäus in his “Physiognomische
    Reisen” would, if handled by Lichtenberg, have made the most
    fruitful stuff for a humorous novel in Sterne’s style.][Footnote 12: II, 11-12: “Im ersten Fall wird er nie, nach dem die
    Stelle vorüber ist, seinen Sieg plötzlich aufgeben.So wie bei ihm
    sich die Leidenschaft kühlt, kühlt sie sich auch bei uns und er
    bringt uns ab, ohne dass wir es wissen.Hingegen im letztern Fall
    nimmt er sich selten die Mühe, sich seines Sieges zu bedienen,
    sondern wirft den Leser oft mehr zur Bewunderung seiner Kunst, als
    seines Herzens in eine andere Art von Verfassung hinein, die ihn
    selbst nichts kostet als Witz, den Leser fast um alles bringt, was
    er vorher gewonnen hatte.”]

  The Koran, etc.Tristram Schandi’s Leben und Meynungen... III, pp.210]
  durch Frankreich und Italien, übersetzt von A. Lewald.Dan was a fast friend
of Brindle Bill.Don was a silent spirit of the other party.They were
equal partners in the wood business, and when a sale was made, Dan
received half of the money, but it so happened that all expenses were
paid by Don.This had been the situation for a long time.In vain Don
appealed to Dan--tried to arouse family pride.The two kept bachelors
hall, and many times, through the long vigils of the night, Don
laid before Dan, their situation, _scoffed at_ by a large family
relationship, because they were poor, and then representing that they
must fail in their business, because half the money received would not
pay expenses, to all of this, Dan would promise to reform--and promise,
and promise, _and promise_, but would always fail.In the dusk of the evening, after a large sale of wood had been made,
at the Carlo wood yard, S. S. Simon, Dan Carlo, Sundown Hill and Brindle
Bill were seen making their way slowly to _headquarters_.Simon's wife
remarked to a person near her, “_Dan's money will go to-night_.”

Don Carlo was seen sitting alone in his cabin, his hand upon his
forehead, his eyes gazing intently upon the floor.The burning coal upon
the hearthstone glimmered in the glory of its element; the voice of the
wild ducks upon the river shore, told the deep, dead hour of the night,
and aroused Don Carlo from his reverie--the sun had crossed the meridian
on the other side of the globe, and no sound of the foot-fall of his
absent brother disturbed the stillness of the hour.Don Carlo picked up a pamphlet that lay upon the table and turned over
the leaves, it was the confession of _Alonzo Phelps_.He said mentally, Phelps was a very bad, but a very brave man.He defied
the city of Vicksburg, defied the law, and the State of Mississippi.He thought of the generations before him, and family pride filled his
veins with warm blood.Don Carlo was ready to face Brindle Bill, or
the Brindle Devil, in defence of his rights, and he started for
_headquarters_.Cool, calculating woman--Simon's wife, the patient watcher for her
absent husband, saw Don Carlo wending his way through the stillness of
the night, to _headquarters_.Her keen, woman's wit, told her there was
trouble ahead.Silently, and unseen, with fire brand in hand, (this was before friction
matches were thought of,) she left the Simon cabin.When Don Carlo arrived at _headquarters_, the door and window was
fastened on the inside, a faint light from a tallow candle, that
glimmered through the cracks of the cabin, whispered the deep laid
scheme of the inmates--S. S. Simon, Sundown Hill and Brindle Bill were
banded together to swindle Dan Carlo.Don Carlo went there to enter that
cabin.Quick as thought he clambered up the corner of the jutting logs,
and passed down the chimney.In front of him, around a square table,
sat four men.On the center of the table a large pile of shining silver
dollars, enlivened the light of the tallow candle.The players looked up in amazement; had an angel from heaven dropped
among them, they would not have been more astonished.While the men sat,
between doubt and fear, Don Carlo raked the money from the table, and
put it in his pocket.Brindle Bill was the first to rise from the table, he held up four
cards, claimed the money, said he was personally insulted by Don Carlo,
and by G--d he should fight it out.He chose S. S. Simon for his second,
and boastingly prepared for the contest.Don Carlo used no words, nor did he choose any second; Sundown Hill and
Dan Carlo looked at each other, and at S. S. Simon, with a look that
said, we stand by Don Carlo.S. S. Simon hallooed _fair play_, and Brindle Bill _pitched in_.Brindle
Bill was the stoutest man, Don Carlo the most active, the contest was
sharp, and very doubtful, notwithstanding the boasting character
of Brindle Bill, true pluck was upon the side of Don Carlo.At this
critical moment, Simon's wife appeared upon the scene of action, the
door of the cabin was fast, Simon was on the inside.She could hear the
blows and smell the blood, for a lucky lick from Don had started
the blood from Brindle Bill's nose, but could not see or know the
combatants.Quick as thought, she applied the fire-brand to the cane
pile, on the west end of the cabin.A strong breeze from the west soon
enveloped the roof of the cabin in flames.The men rushed out into the
open air much frightened.Simon's wife grabbed her husband and dragged
him toward their home, with loud and eloquent cries of _shame_.The
contest was ended, and Don Carlo had the money.Brindle Bill appealed to
the men of his party to see that he should have_ fair play_.His appeals
were all in vain, the fear of him was broken, and he had no great desire
to renew the contest.Seeing no hope in the future, Brindle Bill left
the new settlement.And Don Carlo was justly entitled to the appellation
of the _Hero of Shirt-Tail Bend_.Society was started upon the up-grade.Some planters commenced to settle
in the Bend, little towns were now springing up on the Mississippi, and
Dan Carlo out of his element, made it convenient to visit the towns.A
new era had dawned upon the criminal code in Arkansas--the pistol and
the bowie knife, of which writers of fiction have portrayed in startling
colors.Shortly after these events, Dan Carlo was found _dead in a
saloon_.It was in April, late one Saturday evening, the steamboat “Red Stone”
 blew up sixty-five miles above Louisville, while landing on the Kentucky
shore; the boat burned to the water edge, and many lives were lost.Men
returning from the South, to the homes of their nativity, were consigned
to the placid waters of the Ohio for a resting place, others were
mangled and torn, left to eke out a weary life, without some of their
limbs.The scene upon the shore was heart-rendering above description.The body of one poor man was picked up one-quarter of a mile from the
boat, in a corn field, every bone in his body was broken, and its fall
to the earth made a hole in the ground, eighteen inches deep.How high
he went in the air can only be conjectured, but we may safely say it was
out of sight.Several were seen to fall in the middle of the river, who
never reached the shore.The dead and dying were gathered up and carried
to the houses nearest at hand.The inhabitants of the shore had gathered
for three miles up and down the river--all classes and ages were seen
pulling pieces of the wreck and struggling persons to the shore= Two
girls or half-grown women passed by me walking slowly upon the pebbled
shore, gazing into the water, when some distance from me, I saw one of
them rush into the water up to her arm-pits and drag something to the
shore.I hastened to the spot, and the girls passed on toward the wreck.Several men were carrying the apparently lifeless body of a man upon a
board in the direction of the half-way castle, a place of deposit for
the dead and dying.His identity was ascertained by some papers taken
from his pocket, it was--Don Carlo--the “Hero of Shirt-Tail Bend.”




SCENE THIRD--THE SEPARATED SISTERS.```On the stream of human nature's blood,

````Are ups and downs in every shape and form,

```Some sail gently on a rising flood,

````And some are wrecked in a tearful storm.=

|Tom Fairfield was descended from one of the best families in Virginia.Yet he was animated by what we may call a _restless spirit_.He ran away
from home at twelve years of age, and came to Kentucky with a family
of emigrants, who settled near Boone Station, in 1791.Kentucky, until
after Wayne's treaty, in 1795, was continually exposed to incursions
from the Indians; yet, before Tom's day of manhood, the bloody contest
between the white and the red men had terminated on the virgin soil of
the new-born State--Kentucky was admitted into the Union in 1792.Yet
the heroic struggles with the Indians by the early settlers were fresh
in the memories of all.Prior to the settlement of Kentucky by white
men, the Southern and Northwestern tribes of Indians were in the habit
of hunting here as upon neutral ground.No wigwam had been erected,
but it was claimed by all as a hunting ground.The frequent and fierce
conflicts that occurred upon the meeting of the Indian tribes, together
with conflicts with white men, caused the Indians first to call Kentucky
“_The dark and bloody ground_.” At no point on the American Continent
had the hatred between the two races risen to a higher point.Long
after the peace between England and America, and the close of the war
of American Independence, the conflict between the white and red men in
Kentucky was a war of extermination.The quiet cabin of the white man
was frequently entered, under cover of night, by some roving band of
Indians, and women and children tomahawked in cold blood.White men when
taken by them, whether in the field at work, or behind a tree, watching
their opportunity to shoot an Indian, were taken off to their towns
in Ohio and burned at the stake, or tortured to death in a most cruel
manner.No wonder the early settler in Kentucky swore eternal vengeance
against the Indian who crossed his path, whether in peace or war.In a
land where the white woman has cleaved the skull of the red warrior with
an ax, who attempted to enter her cabin rifle in hand, from whence all
but her had fled--who shall refuse to remember the heroines of the early
settlers, and the historic name of the _dark and bloody ground_.When Tom Fairfield arrived at manhood, the golden wing of peace was
spread over the new-born State, from the Cumberland Mountains to the
Ohio river.A tract of land embracing a beautiful undulating surface, with a black
and fertile soil, the forest growth of which is black walnut, cherry,
honey locust, buckeye, pawpaw, sugar maple, elm, ash, hawthorn,
coffee-tree and yellow poplar, entwined with grape vines of large size,
which has been denominated the garden of Kentucky.Many of the phrases, familiar to our grandfathers, have become obsolete,
such as latch-string, bee-crossing, hunting-shirt, log-rolling,
hominy-block, pack-horse and pack-saddle.While many of their customs have been entirely forgotten, or never
known, by the present generation, a history of some of the events of the
time cannot fail to be interesting.Tom had learned to read and write in Virginia, and this accomplishment
frequently gave him employment, for many of the early settlers were glad
to pay him for his assistance in this line of business, and it suited
Tom to change his place of abode and character of employment.He was
industrious, but never firm in his purpose, frequently commencing an
enterprise, but always ready to abandon it in the middle.Socially he was a great favorite at all wedding-parties, and weddings
were of frequent occurrence about this time.For while Kentucky was over-run with Indians the female portion of
families were slow to immigrate to the scene of such bloody strife,
and many of the early planters were young men, who found themselves
bachelors for the want of female association.But with the influx of
population now taking place, females largely predominated.A wedding in Kentucky at that time was a day of rejoicing, and the young
men in hearing distance all considered themselves invited.A fine dinner
or supper was always prepared; of wine they had none, but distilling
_corn whisky_ was among the first industries of Kentucky, and at every
wedding there was a custom called _running for the bottle_, which was of
course a bottle of whisky.The father of the bride, or some male acquaintance at the house of
the bride--about one hour previous to the time announced for the
ceremony--would stand on the door-step with the bottle in his hand,
ready to deliver it to the first young man that approached him.At the
appointed time the young men of the neighborhood would rendezvous at a
point agreed upon, and when all were ready and the word _go_ given, the
race for the bottle, on fine horses, to the number of fifteen or twenty,
was amusing and highly exciting.Tom had the good fortune to be the
owner of a fleet horse--to own a fine horse and saddle was ever the
pride and ambition of the young Kentuckian--and he won many bottles;
but the end proved that it was bad instead of good luck, for Tom
subsequently became too fond of the bottle.Tom was young and hopeful, far away from his kindred, and he also
married the daughter of an Englishman, who was not so fortunate as to be
the owner of any portion of the virgin soil, but distinguished himself
as a fine gardener, and all the inheritance Tom received with his wife
was a _cart-load of gourds_.You laugh, but you must remember that a few pewter plates and cob-handle
knives was all that adorned the cupboards of some of our fathers, and
gourds of different size made useful vessels.Coffee was not much in
use, and in the dawn of the Revolution a party of brave Americans had
thrown a ship-load of tea into the sea.Tom, like many of the young planters, built a cabin upon a tract of
land, under the Henderson claim, as purchased from the Cherokee Indians,
which claim was subsequently set aside by the State of Virginia.Tom, as we have said, was of a restless disposition, and from a planter
he turned to be a boatman.Leaving his family at home in their cabin, he
engaged to make a trip to Fort Washington (Cincinnati, then a village)
on a keel-boat, descending the Kentucky and ascending the Ohio rivers.On this trip he first beheld the stupendous precipices on the Kentucky
river, where the banks in many places are three hundred feet high, of
solid limestone, and the beautiful country at he mouth of the Kentucky,
on the Ohio river.He was absent from home three months, for prior to steam navigation, the
Ohio had been navigated by keel and flat-bottom boats for a quarter of a
century, and many of the old boatmen were men of dissipated habits--_bad
school for Tom_.When he returned home it was too late in the season
to raise a crop.Tom and his little
family keenly felt the grasp of poverty, and many times, in the dead
hour of night, when the cold wind made the only audible sound on the
outside, the latch-string of the cabin door had been pulled in, and the
fire burned down to a bed of coals, Tom and his wife sat quietly and
sadly by the dim light of a tallow candle, and told the stories of their
families.Tom intended at some future time to return to Virginia and
claim an inheritance, although, as he said, he was not the eldest son
of his father, and by the laws of Virginia the eldest son is entitled to
all of the estate in land, which, as he said, caused him to leave home;
but from other sources he hoped in the future to reap the benefit of an
inheritance.Tom's wife, in her turn, told the story of her ancestors in the old
country, and how she lived in hope of some revival of family fortune,
which by the discovery of the necessary papers, would give her the means
of rising above the cold grasp of poverty, so keenly felt by them; and
many times through the long nights of winter, in that secret chamber
where no intruder comes, Tom and his wife, whom he always called by the
endearing name of _mother_, with a heart-felt desire to honor his infant
children, had many long and interesting interviews upon the subject of
the _ups_ and _downs_ of family fortune.The joyous days of spring dawned upon the little household, and with it
new ideas in the mind of Tom Fairfield; it was to become a _preacher_;
why not?He could read--and must according to the philosophy of the
people understand the Scriptures.Whatever may have been the delinquency
of the early settlers in Kentucky, they were devotedly a religious
people.Ministers of the gospel were not required to study Theology; to be able
to _read_ was the only accomplishment, except the _call_; it was thought
indispensable that a _preacher_ should have _a divine call_.Whatever may be said of ignorant worship, many of the early _preachers_
in Kentucky were men of sterling piety, and did much to elevate and
improve the rude society of the backwoodsmen.What they lacked in
learning they made up in earnestness and a strict devotion to the
_Masters cause_; what they lacked in eloquence they made up in force.Some extracts from the sermons of these old men have been preserved.I
quote from one handed me by a friend:

“As Mo-ses lif-ted up the ser-pent in the wil-der-ness--ah!e-v-e-n so
must the Son of M-a-n be lif-ted up--ah!That who so-e-v-e-r look
up-on him--ah!m-a-y not p-e-r-i-s-h--ah!but h-a-ve e-v-e-r-l-a-sting
l-i-f-e--ah!”

Notwithstanding this halting delivery, these old men laid the foundation
of the refined and elegant society now enjoyed in Kentucky.Tom Fairfield wished to improve his fortune and position in society--pay
for preaching was small--but the many little needs of a family
frequently fell to the lot of a preacher's wife.With this object in
view, and waiting for the _call_, Tom and his wife attended all the
meetings.A _wonderful phenomenon_ occurred about this time, that upset
all of Tom's calculations--it was called the _jerks_.It was principally
confined to the females--but men sometimes were victims of it.During the church service, and generally about the time the preacher's
earnestness had warmed the congregation, the _jerks_ would set in.Some
one in the congregation would commence throwing the head and upper part
of the body backward and forward, the motion would gradually increase,
assuming a spasmodic appearance, until all discretion would leave the
person attacked, and they would continue to _jerk_ regardless of all
modesty, until they _jerked_ themselves upon the floor.Tom and his wife one day attended the meeting of a _sect_, then called
the “_New Lights._” During the service Tom's wife was attacked with
the _jerks_; the motion slow at first became very rapid, her combs flew
among the congregation, and her long black hair cracked like a wagon
whip.Tom was very much frightened, but with the assistance of some
friends the poor woman was taken home, and soon became quiet.The old adage that _bad luck_ never comes single-handed, was now setting
in with Tom.Soon after this event, Tom returned from his labor one
cold, wet evening._Mother_, as he always called his wife, was very dull
and stupid.Tom had attended to all the duties of the little household,
pulled in the latch-string of the cabin door, covered the coals on the
hearth with ashes--as the old people used to say, to keep the _seed_ of
fire.In the morning when he awakened, his faithful wife, dear mother, as he
called her, was by his side, _cold and dead_.With three little daughters in the cabin and nothing else in the wide
world, for the title to his land had been set aside.Disheartened with
his misfortunes, Tom, with his little daughters, moved to the Ohio
river.Port William was the name given to the first settlement ever made at the
mouth of the Kentucky river.Seventy miles above Louisville the Kentucky mingles its water with the
Ohio river, the land on the east side of the Kentucky and on the south
side of the Ohio, narrows into a sharp point--the water is deep up to
the shore.When navigation first commenced this point was the keel-boat
landing, and subsequently the steamboat landing.Here, Dave Deminish kept a saloon, (then called a grocery).One room
sixteen feet square, filled with _cheap John merchandise_, the principal
article for sale was _corn whisky_, distilled in the upper counties,
and shipped to Port William on keel boats,--this article was afterwards
called _old Bourbon_.Port William was blessed with the O!-be-joyful.Redhead Sam Sims run a
whisky shop in connection with, his tavern, but the point, or landing
was the great place of attraction, here idle boatmen were always ready
to entertain idle citizens.Old Brother Demitt owned large tracts of
land, and a number of slaves, and of course he was a leader in society,
why not?he was a member of the church if he did stand on the street
corners, tell low anecdotes, and drink whisky all-day-long.And old Arch
Wheataker owned slaves to work for him, and he, of course, could ride
his old ball-face sorrel horse to Port William, drink whisky all day and
run old Ball home at night.Late in December one dark night, the Angel
of observation was looking into the room of Dave Deminish.A tall man
with silver gray hair was pleading with Dave for one more dram.They
stood by the counter alone, and it was late, the customers had all gone
save Tom Fairfield.Tom offered to pledge his coat as a guarantee for
payment, Dave was anxious to close the store (as he called it), and he
said mildly as he laid his hand softly on Tom's shoulder, “Keep your
coat on, Tom,” and handing him a glass of spoiled beer, affected
friendship.In attempting to drink the beer Tom _heaved_.Dave was
insulted, and kicked him out, and closed the door.On reeling feet,
alone, and in the dark, Tom departed.In the middle of the night
commenced a wonderful snow storm, and the dawn of morning found the
earth covered with a white mantle twenty-four inches deep.The ever diligent eye of the Angel of observation was peering into the
cabin of Tom Fairfield, two miles distant from the _Point_, and one mile
north of Brother Demitts.Roxie, the eldest daughter, found a few sticks
of wood, which happened to be in doors, made up a little fire and was
cooking some corn cakes.Rose had covered Suza with a tattered blanket,
and was rocking her in a trough.The cold wind upon the outside carried
away the inaudible murmurs of the little sisters.At one o'clock in the evening the little fire had burned out.Rose was
still engaged with the baby, and Roxie passed the time between childish
conversations with Rose about the deep snow, and their absent father,
who she said would get the snow out of his way and come, home after
a while, then peeping out the crack of the door to watch for some one
passing.Old Father Tearful had passed the cabin, his face and head
wrapped up with a strap of sheepskin to ward-off the cold, and he did
not hear the cries of Roxie Fairfield.One hour later Suza was crying
piteously and shivering with the cold.Roxie said firmly to Rose, you pet and coax the poor; thing and I will
go to Aunt-Katy's and get some one to come and, and get us some wood,
making a great effort to conceal a half suppressed sob; and a starting
tear.Then patting' Rose on the head with her little hand said
coaxingly, “Be good to-to-the baby, and I'll soon be back.” Leaving both
little sisters in tears, and pulling her little bonnet close 'round her
ears, she left the cabin, and struggled bravely through the deep snow;
fortunately when she gained the track of Father Tearful's horse she had
less difficulty.The old man was riding a Conestoga horse whose feet and
legs, from their large size, made quite an opening in the snow.The Angel eye of observation peering into the east room of Brother
Demitt's house, (he lived in a double cabin of hewn logs,) saw Aunt Katy
sitting on one corner of the hearth-stone, busily plying her fingers
upon a half finished stocking; upon the other corner lay a large
dog; stretched at full length; half way between the two sat the old
house-cat, eying the mastiff and the mistress, and ready to retreat from
the first invader.The hickory logs in the fire-place were wrapping each
other with the red flames of heat, and the cold wind rushing 'round the
corner of the-house was the only sound that disturbed the stillness of
the hour.With a sudden push the door swung upon its hinges, and Roxie Fairfield,
shivering with the cold, appeared upon the stage.Aunt Katy threw her
head back, and looking under her specs, straight down her nose at the
little intruder, said, in a voice half mingled with astonishment,
“Roxie Fairfield, where in the name of heaven did you come from?” Roxie,
nothing abashed by the question, replied in a plaintive tone, “Daddy
didn't come home all night nor all day--and--and we're 'fraid'the
baby'll freeze.” The simple narrative of the child told Aunt Katy the
_whole story_.She knew Tom Fairfield, and although a drunkard, he would
not thus desert his children.“Come to the fire, child,” said Aunt Katy
in a milder tone, and as she turned to the back door she said, mentally,
“_dead, and covered with snow_.” She continued, “Joe, I say, Joe, get
old Ned and hitch him to the wood slide, and go after the Fairfield
children--_quick_--call Dick to help hitch up.” Dick was an old <DW64>
who had the gout so bad in his left foot that he could not wear a shoe,
and that foot wrapped up in a saddle blanket, made an impression in the
snow about the size of an elephant's track.Roxie made a start to return as she came, and while Aunt Katy was
coaxing and persuading her to wait for the slide, Joe, a <DW52> boy,
and old Ned were gotten ready for the venture.Dick, by Aunt Katy's
directions, had thrown a straw bed upon the slide, and bearing his
weight upon his right foot, he caught Roxie by the arms and carefully
placed her upon it.Joe, as he held the rope-reins in one hand and a long switch in the
other, turned his eyes upon the face of the little heroine, all mingled
with doubt and fear, saying in a harsh tone, “keep yourself in the
middle of the slide, puss, for I'm gwine to drive like litenin'.”

Aunt Katy stood in the cold door gazing at the running horse and slide
until they were out of sight, and then turning to Dick who, standing by
the chimney, was holding his left foot close to the coals, said, “Tom
Fairfield is dead and under the snow, poor soul!and them children will
have to be raised, and I'll bet the nittin' of five pair of stockins
that old Demitt will try to poke one of 'em on me.”

Joe soon returned with the precious charge.He had Suza, the baby, in
her rocking trough, well wrapped up in the old blanket and placed in
the middle of the slide, with Roxie seated on one side and Rose on the
other.The slide had no shafts by which the old horse could hold it
back; it was Dick's office to hold back with a rope when drawing wood,
but he was too slow for this trip, and Joe's long switch served to keep
old Ned ahead of the slide when traveling down hill.A large fire and a warm room, with Aunt Katy's pacifying tones of
voice, soon made the little sisters comparatively happy; she promised
them that daddy would soon return.The news soon spread through the neighborhood, and every one who knew
Tom Fairfield solemnly testified that he would not desert his children;
the irresistible conclusion was that while intoxicated he was frozen,
and that he lay dead under the snow.A council of the settlers, (for all were considered neighbors for ten
miles 'round,) was called, over which Brother Demitt presided.Aunt
Katy, as the nearest neighbor and first benefactress, claimed the
preemption right to the first choice, which was of course granted.Roxie, the eldest, was large enough to perform some service in a family,
and Rose would soon be; Suza, the baby, was the trouble.Aunt Katy
was called upon to take her choice before other preliminaries could be
settled.Suza, the baby, with her bright little eyes, red cheeks and proud
efforts, to stand alone, had won Aunt Katy's affections, and she,
without any persuasion on the part of old Demitt, emphatically declared
that Suza should never leave her house until she left it as a free
woman.Evaline Estep and Aunt Fillis Foster were the contending candidates
for Rose and Roxie.Brother Demitt decided that Aunt Fillis should take Roxie, and Mrs.Estep should be foster mother to Rose, with all the effects left in the
Fairfield cabin.These ladies lived four miles from the Demitt house, in different
directions.With much persuasion and kind treatment they bundled up the
precious little charges and departed.While the Angel of sorrow hovered round the little hearts of the
departed sisters.SCENE FOURTH--ROXIE DAYMON AND ROSE SIMON.```The road of life is light and dark,

|Since the curtain fell upon the closing sentence in the last scene,
many long and tedious seasons have passed away.The placid waters of the beautiful Ohio have long since been disturbed
by steam navigation; and the music of the steam engine echoing from the
river hills have alarmed the bat and the owl, and broke the solitude
around the graves of many of the first settlers.The infant images of the early settlers are men
and women.In the order of time Roxie Fairfield, the heroine of the snow
storm, and Aunt Fillis Foster, claim our attention.With a few back glances at girlhood, we hasten on to her womanhood.Aunt
Fillis permitted Roxie to attend a country school a few months in each
year.The school house was built of round logs, was twenty feet square,
with one log left out on the south side for a window.The seats were
made of slabs from the drift wood on the Ohio River, (the first cut
from the log, one side flat, the other having the shape of the log,
rounding); holes were bored in the slabs and pins eighteen inches long
inserted for legs.These benches were set against the wall of the room,
and the pupils arranged sitting in rows around the room.In the center
sat the teacher by a little square table, with a switch long enough to
reach any pupil in the house without rising from his seat.And thus the
heroine of the snow storm received the rudiments of an education, as she
grew to womanhood.Roxie was obedient, tidy--and twenty, and like all girls of her class,
had a lover.Aunt Fillis said Roxie kept everything about the house in
the right place, and was always in the right place herself; she said
more, she could not keep house without her.By what spirit Aunt Fillis
was animated we shall not undertake to say, but she forbade Roxie's
lover the prerogative of her premises.Roxie's family blood could never submit to slavery, and she ran
away with her lover, was married according to the common law, which
recognizes man and wife as one, and the man is that one.They went to Louisville, and the reader has already been introduced to
the womanhood of Roxie Fairfield in the person of Daymon's wife.The reader is referred to the closing sentence of Scene First.Daymon
was granted a new trial, which never came off, and the young couple left
Louisville and went to Chicago, Illinois.Roxie had been concealed by a
female friend, and only learned the fate of Daymon a few minutes before
she entered the court room.Daymon resolved to reform, for when future
hope departed, and all but life had fled, the faithful Roxie rose like a
spirit from the dead to come and stand by him.Daymon and Roxie left Louisville without any intimation of
their-destination to any one, without anything to pay expenses, and
nothing but their wearing apparel, both resolved to work, for the sun
shone as brightly upon them as it did upon any man and woman in the
world.As a day laborer Daymon worked in and around the infant city, as
ignorant of the bright future as the wild ducks that hovered 'round the
shores of the lake.It is said that P. J. Marquette, a French missionary from Canada was the
first white man that settled on the spot where Chicago now stands.This
was before the war of the Revolution, and his residence was temporary.Many years afterward a <DW64> from San Domingo made some improvements
at the same place; but John Kinzie is generally regarded as the first
settler at Chicago, for he made a permanent home there in 1804.For a
quarter of a century the village had less than one hundred inhabitants.A wild onion that grew there, called by the Indians Chikago, gave the
name to the city.After a few years of hard, labor and strict economy a land-holder was
indebted to Daymon the sum of one hundred and fifty dollars.Daymon
wished to collect his dues and emigrate farther west.By the persuasion
of Roxie he was induced to accept a deed to fifteen acres of land.In a
short time he sold one acre for more than the cost of the whole tract,
and was soon selling by the foot instead of the acre.The ever wakeful eye of the Angel of observation is peering into the
parlor of the Daymon _palace_, to see Roxie surrounded with all the
luxuries of furniture, sitting by an ornamented table, upon which lay
gilt-edged paper; in the center of the table sat a pearl ink-stand and a
glass ornament set with variegated colors.Roxie's forehead rested upon
the palm of her left hand, elbow on the table.Profound reflections
are passing through her brain; they carry her back to the days of her
childhood.Oh, how she loved Suza; the little bright eyes gazed upon
her and the red lips pronounced the inaudible sound, “_dear sister_.”
 “Yes, I will write,” said Roxie, mentally.She takes the gold pen in
her right hand, adjusting the paper with her left, she _paused_ to
thank from the bottom of her heart old Ben Robertson, who in the country
school had taught her the art of penmanship._Hush!_ did the hall bell
ring?In a few minutes a servant appeared at the door and announced the
name of Aunt Patsy Perkins.“Admit Aunt Patsy--tell her your mistress is at home,” said Roxie,
rising from the table.Aunt Patsy Perkins was floating upon the surface of upper-tendom
in Chicago.She understood all of the late styles; a queen in the
drawing-room, understood the art precisely of entertaining company; the
grandest ladies in the city would listen to the council of Aunt Patsy,
for she could talk faster and more of it than any woman west of the
Alleghany Mountains.The visitor enters the room; Roxie offers Aunt Patsy an easy chair;
Aunt Patsy is wiping away the perspiration with a fancy kerchief, in one
hand, and using the fan with the other.When seated she said:

“I must rest a little, for I have something to tell you, and I will
tell you now what it is before I begin.Old Perkins has no more love for
style than I have for his _dratted poor kin_.But as I was going to tell
you, Perkins received a letter from Indiana, stating this Cousin Sally
wished to make us a visit.She's a plain, poor girl, that knows no more
of style than Perkins does of a woman's comforts.I'll tell you what
it is, Mrs.Daymon, if she does come, if I don't make it hot for old
Perkins, it'll be because I can't talk.A woman has nothing but her
tongue, and while I live I will use mine.”

Then pointing her index finger at Roxie, continued: “I will tell you
what it is Mrs.Daymon, take two white beans out of one hull, and place
them on the top of the garden fence, and then look at 'em across the
garden, and if you can tell which one is the largest, you can seen what
difference there is in the way old Perkins hates style and I hate his
_dratted poor kin_.What wealthy families are to do in this city, God
only knows.I think sometimes old Perkins is a _wooden man_, for, with
all my style, I can make no more impression on h-i-m, than I can upon
an oak stump, Mrs.What if he did make a thousand dollars last
week, when he wants to stick his _poor kin_ 'round me, like stumps in a
flower garden.” At this point Roxie ventured to say a word.“Aunt Patsy,
I thought Jim was kinsfolk on your side of the house.”

“Yes, but honey, I am good to Jim, poor soul, he knows it,” said Aunt
Patsy gravely, and then she paused.Jim was a poor boy, eighteen years old, and the son of Aunt Patsy's dear
brother, long since laid under the dark green sod of Indiana.The poor
boy, hearing of the wealth of his Aunt Patsy, had come to Chicago and
was working on the streets, poorly clad.Aunt Patsy would sometimes give him a few dollars, as you would throw
a bone to a dog, requesting him at the same time to always come to the
back door, and never be about the house when she had company.Aunt Patsy said emphatically, as she left the Daymon palace, “I'll tell
you what it is, Mrs.Daymon, I'm goin' home to study human nature,
and if I don't find some avenue to reach old Perkim, I shall take the
liberty to insult the first one of his _dratted poor kin_ that sets foot
in my house.”

After Aunt Patsy left, Roxie thought no more of her letter of inquiry,
and company engaged her attention for some days until the subject passed
entirely out of her mind.Soon after these events Roxie died with the cholera--leaving an only
daughter--and was buried as ignorant of the fate of her sister as the
stone that now stands upon her grave.We must now turn back more than a decade, which brings us to the burning
of the steamboat Brandywine, on the Mississippi river.The boat was
heavily freighted, with a large number of passengers on board; the
origin of the fire has never been positively known; it was late in
the night, with a heavy breeze striking the boat aft, where the fire
occurred.In a short time all on board was in confusion; the pilot, from
the confusion of the moment, or the lack of a proper knowledge of the
river, headed the boat for the wrong shore, and she ran a-ground on
a deep sand bar a long way from shore and burned to the waters' edge;
between the two great elements of fire and water many leaped into the
river and were drowned, and some reached the shore on pieces of
the wreck.Among those fortunate enough to reach the shore was an
Englishman, who was so badly injured he was unable to walk; by the more
fortunate he was carried to the cabin of a wood cutter, where he soon
after died.When he fully realized the situation he called for ink and paper; there
was none on the premises; a messenger was dispatched to the nearest
point where it was supposed the articles could be obtained, but he was
too late.When the last moments came the dying man made the following
statement: “My name is John A. Lasco.I have traveled for three years
in this country without finding the slightest trace of the object of
my search--an only and a dear sister.Her name is Susan Lasco; with our
father she left the old country many years ago.They were poor.--the
family fortune being held in abeyance by the loss of some papers.I
remained, but our father gave up all hope and emigrated to America,
taking Susan with him.In the course of nature the old man is dead,
and my sister Susan, if she is living, is the last, or soon will be the
last, link of the family.I am making this statement as my last will and
testament.Some years ago the post-master in my native town received
a letter from America stating that by the confession of one, Alonzo
Phelps, who was condemned to die, that there was a bundle of papers
concealed in a certain place by him before he left the country.Search
was made and the papers found which gave me the possession of the family
estate.The letter was subscribed D. C., which gave a poor knowledge of
the writer.I sold the property and emigrated to this country in search
of my sister; I have had poor success.She probably married, and the
ceremony changed her name, and I fear she is hopelessly lost to her
rights; her name was Susan Lasco--what it is now, God only knows.But
to Susan Lasco, and her descendants, I will the sum of twenty thousand
dollars, now on deposit in a western bank; the certificate of deposit
names the bank; the papers are wet and now upon my person; the money in
my pocket, $110, I will to the good woman of this house--with a request
that she will carefully dry and preserve my papers, and deliver them
to some respectable lawyer in Memphis----” at this point the speaker was
breathing hard--his tone of voice almost inaudible.At his request,
made by signs, he was turned over and died in a few moments without any
further directions.The inmates of the cabin, besides the good woman of the house, were only
a few wood cutters, among whom stood Brindle Bill, of Shirt-Tail
Bend notoriety.Bill, to use his own language, was _strap'd_, and was
chopping wood at this point to raise a little money upon which to make
another start.Many years had passed away since he left Shirt Tail Bend.He had been three times set on shore, from steamboats, for playing sharp
tricks at three card monte upon passengers, and he had gone to work,
which he never did until he was entirely out of money.Brindle Bill left
the cabin, _ostensibly_ to go to work; but he sat upon the log, rubbed
his hand across his forehead, and said mentally, “Susan La-s-co.By the
last card in the deck, _that is the name_; if I didn't hear Simon's
wife, in Shirt-Tail Bend, years ago, say her mother's name was S-u-s-a-n
L-a-s-c-o.I will never play another game; and--and _twenty thousand in
bank_.By hell, I've struck a lead.”

The ever open ear of the Angel of observation was catching the sound of
a conversation in the cabin of Sundown Hill in Shirt-Tail Bend.It was
as follows--

“Many changes, Bill, since you left here; the Carlo wood yard has play'd
out; Don Carlo went back to Kentucky.I heard he was blowed up on a
steamboat; if he ever come down again I did'nt hear of it.”

“Hope he never did,” said Bill, chawing the old grudge with his eye
teeth.Hill continued: “You see, Bill, the old wood yards have given place to
plantations.Simon, your old friend, is making pretentions to be called
a planter,” said Sundown Hill to Brindle Bill, in a tone of confidence.“Go slow, Hill, there is a hen on the nest.I come back here to play a
strong game; twenty thousand in bank,” and Brindle Bill winked with his
right eye, the language of which is, I deal and you play the cards I
give you.“You heard of the burning of the Brandywine; well, there was
an Englishman went up in that scrape, and he left twenty thousand in
bank, and Rose Simon is the _heir_,” said Bill in a tone of confidence.“And what can that profit y-o-u?” said Hill rather indignantly.“I am playing this game; I want you to send for Simon,” said Bill rather
commandingly.“Simon has changed considerably since you saw him; and, besides,
fortunes that come across the water seldom prove true.Men who have
fortunes in their native land seldom seek fortunes in a strange
country,” said Hill argumentatively.“There is no mistake in this case, for uncle John had-the _di-dapper
eggs_ in his pocket,” said Bill firmly.Late that evening three men, in close council, were seen, in Shirt-Tail
Bend.S. S. Simon had joined the company of the other two.After Brindle
Bill had related to Simon the events above described, the following
questions and answers, passed between the two:

“Mrs.Simon's mother was named Susan Lasco?”

“Undoubtedly; and her father's name was Tom Fairfield.She is the brave
woman who broke up, or rather burned up, the gambling den in Shirt-Tail
Bend.Evaline Estep, her parents having died when she was quite young.The old lady Estep tried to horn me off; but I _beat her_.Well the old
Christian woman gave Rose a good many things, among which was a box of
family keep sakes; she said they were given to her in consideration of
her taking the youngest child of the orphan children.There may be
something in that box to identify the family.”

At this point Brindle Bill winked his right eye--it is my deal, you play
the cards I give you.As Simon was about to' leave the company, to break
the news to his wife, Brindle Bill said to him very confidentially:
“You find out in what part of the country this division of the orphan
children took place, and whenever you find that place, be where it
will, right there is where I was raised--the balance of them children is
_dead_, Simon,” and he again winked his right eye.“I understand,” said Simon, and as he walked on towards home to apprise
Rose of her good fortune, he said mentally, “This is Bill's deal, I will
play the cards he gives me.” Simon was a shifty man; he stood in the
_half-way house_ between the honest man and the rogue: was always ready
to take anything he could lay hands on, as long as he could hold some
one else between himself and danger.Rose Simon received the news with
delight.She hastened to her box of keepsakes and held before Simon's
astonished eyes an old breast-pin with this inscription: “Presented to
Susan Lasco by her brother, John A. Lasco, 1751.”

“That's all the evidence we want,” said Simon emphatically.“Now,”
 continued Simon, coaxingly, “What became of your sisters?”

“You know when Mrs.Estep moved to Tennessee I was quite small.I have
heard nothing of my sisters since that time.It has been more than
fifteen years,” said Rose gravely.“At what point in Kentucky were you separated?” said Simon inquiringly.“Port William, the mouth of the Kentucky river,” said Rose plainly.“Brindle Bill says they are dead,” said Simon slowly.“B-r-i-n-d-l-e  B-i-l-l, why, I would not believe him on oath,” said Rose
indignantly.“Yes, but he can prove it,” said Simon triumphantly, and he then
continued, “If we leave any gaps down, _my dear_, we will not be able to
draw the money until those sisters are hunted up, and then it would cut
us down to less than seven thousand dollars--and that would hardly build
us a fine house,” and with many fair and coaxing words Simon obtained a
promise from Rose that she would permit him to manage the business.At the counter of a western bank stood S. S. Simon and party presenting
the certificate of deposit for twenty thousand dollars.In addition to
the breast-pin Rose had unfolded an old paper, that had laid for years
in the bottom of her box.It was a certificate of the marriage of Tom
Fairfield and Susan Lasco.Brindle Bill and Sundown Hill were sworn and
testified that Rose Simon _alias_ Rose Fairfield was the only surviving
child of Tom Fairfield and Susan Lasco.Brindle Bill said he was raised
in Port William, and was at the funeral of the little innocent years
before, The money was paid over.Rose did not believe a word that
Bill said but she had promised Simon that she would let him manage the
business, and few people will refuse money when it is thrust upon them.The party returned to Shirt-Tail Bend.Simon deceived Rose with the plea
of some little debts, paid over to Brindle Bill and Sundown Hill three
hundred dollars each.Brindle Bill soon got away with three hundred
dollars; “Strop'd again,” he said mentally, and then continued, “Some
call it blackmailin' or backmailin', but I call it a _back-handed_ game.It is nothing but making use of power, and if a fellow don't use power
when it's put in his hands he had better bunch tools and quit.”
 Brindle Bill said to S. S. Simon, “I have had a streak of bad luck; lost
all my money; want to borrow three hundred dollars.No use to say you
havn't got it, for I can find them sisters of your wife in less than
three weeks,” and he winked his right eye.Simon hesitated, but finally with many words of caution paid over the
money.Soon after these events S. S. Simon was greatly relieved by reading in
a newspaper the account of the sentence of Brindle Bill to the state
prison for a long term of years.S. S. Simon now stood in the front rank of the planters of his
neighborhood; had built a new house and ready to furnish it; Rose was
persuaded by him to make the trip with him to New Orleans and select her
furniture for the new house.While in the city Rose Simon was attacked
with the yellow fever and died on the way home.She was buried in
Louisiana, intestate and childless.SCENE FIFTH.--THE BELLE OF PORT WILLIAM.```A cozy room, adorned with maiden art,

```Her youthful heart was all her own.```Her sisters gone, and every kindred tie,

|The voice of history and the practice of historians has been to dwell
upon the marching of armies; the deeds of great heroes; the rise and
fall of governments; great battles and victories; the conduct of troops,
etc., while the manners and customs of the people of whom they write are
entirely ignored.Were it not for the common law of England, we would have a poor
knowledge of the manners and customs of the English people long
centuries ago.The common law was founded upon the manners and customs of the people,
and many of the principles of the common law have come down to the
present day.And a careful study of the common laws of England is the
best guide to English civilization long centuries ago.Manners and customs change with almost every generation, yet the
principles upon which our manners and customs are founded are less
changeable.Change is marked upon almost everything It is said that the particles
which compose our bodies change in every seven years.The oceans
and continents change in a long series of ages.Change is one of the
universal laws of matter.Brother Demitt left Port
William, on foot and full of whisky, one cold evening in December.The
path led him across a field fenced from the suburbs of the village.The
old man being unable to mount the fence, sat down to rest with his back
against the fence--here it is supposed he fell into a stupid sleep.The
cold north wind--that never ceases to blow because some of Earth's poor
children are intoxicated--wafted away the spirit of the old man, and
his neighbors, the next morning, found the old man sitting against the
fence, frozen, cold and dead.Old Arch Wheataker, full of whisky, was running old Ball for home one
evening in the twilight.Old Ball, frightened at something by the side
of the road, threw the old man against a tree, and “busted” his head.Dave Deminish had retired from business and given place to the
brilliantly lighted saloon.Old Dick, the <DW64> man, was sleeping
beneath the sod, with as little pain in his left foot as any other
member of his body.Joe, the <DW52> boy that drove the wood slide so
fast through the snow with the little orphan girls, had left home, found
his way to Canada, and was enjoying his freedom in the Queen s Dominion.The Demitt estate had passed through the hands of administrators much
reduced.Old Demitt died intestate, and Aunt Katy had no children.His
relations inherited his estate, except Aunt Katy's life interest.But
Aunt Katy had money of her own, earned with her own hands.Every dry goods store in Port
William was furnished with stockings knit by the hands of Aunt Katy.The
passion to save in Aunt Katy's breast, like Aaron's serpent, swallowed
up the rest.Aunt Katy was a good talker--except of her own concerns, upon which she
was non-committal.She kept her own counsel and her own money.It was
supposed by the Demitt kinsfolk that Aunt Katy had a will filed away,
and old Ballard, the administrator, was often interrogated by the
Demitt kinsfolk about Aunt Katy's will.Old Ballard was a cold man of
business--one that never thought of anything that did not pay him--and,
of course, sent all will-hunters to Aunt Katy.The Demitt relations indulged in many speculations about Aunt Katy's
money.Some counted it by the thousand, and all hoped to receive their
portion when the poor old woman slept beneath the sod.Aunt Katy had moved to Port William, to occupy one of the best houses
in the village, in which she held a life estate.Aunt Katy's household
consisted of herself and Suza Fairfield, eleven years old, and it was
supposed by the Demitt relations, that when Aunt Katy died, a will would
turn up in favor of Suza Fairfield.Tom Ditamus had moved from the backwoods of the Cumberland mountains
to the Ohio river, and not pleased with the surroundings of his adopted
locality, made up his mind to return to his old home.Tom had a wife and
two dirty children.Tom's wife was a pussy-cat woman, and obeyed all of
Tom's commands without ever stopping to think on the subject of “woman's
rights.” Tom was a sulky fellow; his forehead retreated from his
eyebrows, at an angle of forty-five degrees, to the top of his head; his
skull had a greater distance between the ears than it had fore and aft';
a dark shade hung in the corner of his eye, and he stood six feet above
the dirt with square shoulders.Tom was too great a coward to steal, and
too lazy to work.Tom intended to return to his old home in a covered
wagon drawn by an ox team.The Demitt relations held a council, and appointed one of their number
to confer with Tom Ditamus and engage him to take Suza Fairfield--with
his family and in his wagon--to the backwoods of the Cumberland
Mountains.For, they said, thus spirited away Aunt Katy would never hear
from her; and Aunt Katy's money, when broken loose from where she
was damming it up, by the death of the old thing would flow in its
legitimate channel.And the hard-favored and the hard-hearted Tom agreed to perform the job
for ten dollars.It was in the fall of the year and a foggy morning.When the atmosphere
is heavy the cold of the night produces a mist by condensing the
dampness of the river, called fog; it is sometimes so thick, early in
the morning, that the eye cannot penetrate it more than one hundred
yards.Tom was ready to start, and fortunately for him, seeing Suza Fairfield
passing his camp, he approached her.She thought he wished to make some
inquiry, and stood still until the strong man caught her by the arm,
with one hand in the other hand he held an ugly gag, and told her if she
made any noise he would put the bit in her mouth and tie the straps on
the back of her head.The child made one scream, but as Tom prepared to
gag her she submitted, and Tom placed her in his covered wagon between
his dirty children, giving the gag to his wife, and commanding her if
Suza made the slightest noise to put the bridle on her, and in the dense
clouds of fog Tom drove his wagon south.Suza realized that she was captured, but for what purpose she could not
divine; with a brave heart--far above her years--she determined to make
her escape the first night, for after that she said, mentally, she
would be unable to find home.She sat quietly and passed the day in
reflection, and resolved in her mind that she would leave the caravan of
Tom Ditamus that night, or die in the attempt.She remembered the words
of Aunt Katy--“Discretion is the better part of valor”--and upon that
theory the little orphan formed her plan.The team traveled slow, for Tom was compelled to let them rest--in the
warm part of the day--the sun at last disappeared behind the western
horizon.To the unspeakable delight of the little prisoner, in a dark
wood by the shore of a creek, Tom encamped for the night, building a
fire by the side of a large log.The party in the wagon, excepting Suza,
were permitted to come out and sit by the fire.While Tom's wife was
preparing supper, Suza imploringly begged Tom to let her come to the
fire, for she had something to tell him.Tom at last consented, but said
cautiously, “you must talk low.”

“_Oh!I will talk so easy_,” said Suza, in a stage whisper.She was
permitted to take her seat with the party on a small log, and here for
an hour she entertained them with stories of abuse that she had received
from the _old witch, Aunt Katy_, and emphatically declared that she
would go anywhere to get away from the _old witch_.The orphan girl, eleven years of age, threw Tom Dita-mus, a man
thirty-five years of age, entirely off his guard.Tom thought he had a
_soft thing_ and the whole party were soon sound asleep, except Suza.With a step as light as a timid cat, Suza Fairfield left Tom Ditamus and
his family sleeping soundly on the bank of the creek in the dark woods,
and sped toward Port William.They had traveled only ten miles with
a lazy ox team and the active feet of the little captive could soon
retrace the distance, if she did not lose the way; to make assurance.doubly sure, Suza determined to follow the Kentucky river, for she knew
that would take her to Port William; the road was part of the way on the
bank of the river, but sometimes diverged into the hills a considerable
distance from the river.At those places Suza would follow the river,
though her path was through dense woods and in places thickly set with
underbrush and briars.Onward the brave little girl would struggle,
until again relieved by the friendly road making its appearance again
upon the bank of the river, and then the nimble little feet would travel
at the rate of four miles an hour.Again Suza would have to take to
the dark woods, with no lamp to guide her footsteps but the twinkling
distant star.In one of these ventures Suza was brought to a stand, by
the mouth of White's creek pouring its lazy waters into the Kentucky
river.An owl
broke the stillness of the night on the opposite side of the creek.The
last note of his voice seemed to say, _come over--over--little gal_.Suza sank upon the ground and wept bitterly.It is said that the cry of
a goose once saved Rome.The seemingly taunting cry of the owl did not
save Suza, but her own good sense taught her that she could trace the
creek on the south side until she would find a ford, and when across
the creek retrace it back on the north side to the unerring river; and
although this unexpected fate had perhaps doubled her task, she had
resolved to perform it.She remembered Aunt Katy's words, “if there is
a will, there is a way,” and onward she sped for two long hours.Suza
followed the zigzag course of the bewildering creek, and found herself
at last in the big road stretching up from the water of the creek.She recognized the ford, for here she had passed in the hateful prison
wagon, and remembered that the water was not more than one foot deep.Suza pulled off her little shoes and waded the creek; when upon the
north side she looked at the dark woods, on the north bank of the creek,
and at the friendly road, so open and smooth to her little feet, and
said, mentally, “this road will lead me to Port William, and I will
follow it, if Tom Ditamus does catch me;” and Onward she sped.The dawn of morning had illuminated the eastern sky, when Suza Fairfield
beheld the broad and, beautiful bottom land of the Ohio river.No mariner that ever circumnavigated the globe could have beheld his
starting point with more delight than Suza Fairfield beheld the chimneys
in Port William.She was soon upon the home street, and saw the chimney
of Aunt Katy's house; no smoke was rising from it as from others;
everything about the premises was as still as the breath of life on the
Dead Sea.Suza approached the back yard, the door of Aunt Katy's room
was not fastened, it turned upon its hinges as Suza touched it; Aunt
Katy's bed was not tumbled; the fire had burned down; in front of the
smoldering coals Aunt Katy sat upon her easy chair, her face buried in
her hands, elbows upon her knees--Suza paused--_Aunt Katy sleeps_; a
moment's reflection, and then Suza laid her tiny hand upon the gray
head of the sleeping woman, and pronounced the words, nearest her little
heart in a soft, mellow tone, “A-u-n-t K-a-t-y.”

In an instant Aunt Katy Demitt was pressing Suza Fairfield close to her
old faithful heart.Old and young tears were mingled together for a few minutes, and then
Suza related her capture and escape as we have recorded it; at the close
of which Suza was nearly out of breath.Aunt Katy threw herself upon her
knees by the bedside and covered her face with the palms of her hands.Suza reflected, and thought of something she had not related, and
starting toward the old mother with the words on her tongue when the
Angel of observation placed his finger on her lips, with the audible
sound of _hush!_ Aunt Katy's praying.Aunt Katy rose from her posture with the words: “I understand it all my
child; the Demitts want you out of the way.Well, if they get the few
four pences that I am able to scrape together old Katy Demitt will give
'em the last sock that she ever expects to knit; forewarned, fore-armed,
my child.As for Tom Ditamus, he may go for what he is worth.He has
some of the Demitt-money, no doubt, and I have a warning that will last
me to the grave.Old Demitt had one fault, but God knows his kinsfolk
have thousands.”

Aunt Katy took Suza by the hand and led her to the hiding place, and
Suza Fairfield, for the first time, beheld Aunt Katy's money--five
hundred dollars in gold and silver--and the old foster mother's will,
bequeathing all her earthly possessions to Suza Fairfield.The will was
witnessed by old Ballard and old Father Tearful.And from thence forward
Suza was the only person in the wide world in full possession of Aunt
Katy Demitt's secrets.Tantalized by her relations, Aunt Katy was like a
student of botany, confined in the center of a large plain with a single
flower, for she doated on Suza Fairfield with a love seldom realized by
a foster mother.Tom Ditamus awoke the next morning (perhaps about the time Suza entered
Port William) and found the little prisoner gone.Tom did not care; he
had his money, and he yoked up his cattle and traveled on.We must now look forward more than a decade in order to speak of Don
Carlo, the hero of Shirt-Tail Bend, whom, in our haste to speak of other
parties, we left at the half-way castle in a senseless condition, on the
fatal day of the explosion of the Red Stone.The half-way castle was one of the first brick houses ever built on the
Ohio river.It had long been the property of infant heirs, and rented
out or left unoccupied; it stood on the southern bank of the river
about half way between Louisville and Cincinnati, hence the name of
the half-way castle.Don Carlo was severely stunned, but not fatally
injured; he had sold out in Shirt-Tail Bend, and was returning to the
home of his childhood when the dreadful accident occured.Don had
saved a little sum of money with which he had purchased a small farm in
Kentucky, and began to reflect that he was a bachelor.Numerous friends
had often reminded him that a brave young lady had rushed into the
water and dragged his lifeless body to the friendly shore, when in a few
minutes more he would have been lost forever.Twelve months or more after these events a camp meeting was announced to
come off in the neighborhood of Port William.Camp meetings frequently
occurred at that day in Kentucky.The members of the church, or at least
a large portion of them, would prepare to camp out and hold a protracted
meeting.When the time and place were selected some of the interested
parties would visit the nearest saw mill and borrow several wagon loads
of lumber, draw it to the place selected, which was always in the woods
near some stream or fountain of water, with the plank placed upon logs
or stumps, they would erect the stand or pulpit, around the same, on
three sides at most, they would arrange planks for seats by placing them
upon logs and stumps; they would also build shanties and partly fill
them with straw, upon which the campers slept.Fires were kindled
outside for cooking purposes.Here they would preach and pray, hold
prayer meetings and love feasts night and day, sometimes for two or
three weeks.On the Sabbath day the whole country, old and young, for
ten miles around, would attend the camp meeting.Don Carlo said to a friend: “I shall attend the camp meeting, for I have
entertained a secret desire for a long time to make the acquaintance of
the young lady who it is said saved my life from the wreck of the Red
Stone.”

The camp meeting will afford the opportunity.Don and his friend were standing upon the camp ground; the
people were pouring in from all directions; two young ladies passed them
on their way to the stand; one of them attracted Don Carlo's attention,
she was not a blonde nor a brunette, but half way between the two,
inheriting the beauty of each.Don said to his friend;

“There goes the prettiest woman in America.”

Then rubbing his hand over his forehead, continued;

“You are acquainted with people here, I wish you would make some inquiry
of that lady's name and family.”

“I thought you was hunting the girl that pulled you out of the river,”
 said his friend, sarcastically.“Yes, but I want to know the lady that has just passed us,” said Don,
gravely.It has puzzled mental
philosophers of all ages; and no one has ever told us why a man will
love one woman above all the balance of God's creatures.And then, the
strangest secret in the problem is, that a third party can see nothing
lovable in the woman so adored by her lord.No wonder, the ancient Greeks represented cupid as blind.No, they did
not represent him as blind, but only blind folded, which undoubtedly
leaves the impression that the love-god may peep under the bandage; and
we advise all young people to take advantage of that trick--look before
you love.History has proven that persons of the same temperament should
not marry, for their children are apt to inherit the _bad_ qualities
of each parent; while upon the other hand, when opposites marry the
children are apt to inherit the _good_ qualities of each parent.Marriage is the most important step taken in life.When a young man goes
out into the world to seek fame and _fortune_ the energies of his mind
are apt to concentrate upon the problem of obtaining a large fortune.The wife is thought of as a convenience, the love-god is consulted and
fancy rules the occasion.Now let me say to all young men, the family is
the great object of life, you may pile millions together, and it is all
scattered as soon as you are dead.A man's children are his only living
and permanent representatives.You should not therefore consult fancy with regard to fortune or other
trivial things, but in the name of all the gods, at once consult common
sense in regard to the family you produce.While Don's friend was upon the tour of inquiry to ascertain the
identity of the handsome young lady, Don sat alone upon a log, and said
mentally, “A woman may draw me out of the sea ten thousand times, and
she would never look like that young lady.Perhaps out of my reach.” Don's friend returned smiling.“Lucky,
lucky,” and Don's friend concluded with a laugh.“What now?” said Don,
impatiently.“That lady is the girl that drew Don Carlo out of the river, her name
is Suza Fairfield, and she is the belle of Port William.An orphan girl
raised and educated by old Aunt Katy Demitt.She has had a number of
suitors, but has never consented to leave Aunt Katy's house as a free
woman.”

When the congregation dispersed in the evening, Don Carlo and Suza
Fairfield rode side by side toward Port William.The ever open ear of the
Angel of observation, has only furnished us with these words:

“You are old, my liege, slightly touched with gray.Pray let me live and
with Aunt Katy stay.”

“With old Aunt Katy you shall live my dear, and on her silent grave drop
a weeping tear.”

We can only speak of Suza Fairfield as we wish to speak of all other
belles.=

````The outward acts of every belle,

`````Her inward thoughts reveal;

````And by this rule she tries to tell

`````How other people feel.=

It was the neighborhood talk, that Suza Fairfield, the belle of Port
William, and Don Carlo, the hero of Shirt-Tail Bend, were engaged to be
married.Aunt Katy at the table, Betsey Green and
Cousin Sally; the meeting and the show; all neighborhoods will talk, for
God has made them so.Secrets should be kept, but neighbors let them go; with caution on the
lip, they let a neighbor know, all secrets here below.Some add a little
and some take away.They hold a secret _sacred_ and only tell a friend, and then whisper
in the ear, Silly told me this and you must keep it dear; when all have
kept it and every body knows, true or false, they tell it as it goes.SCENE SIXTH.--THE SECOND GENERATION.````The son may wear the father's crown,

````When the gray old father's dead;

````May wear his shoe, and wear his gown,

````But he can never wear his head.=

|How few realize that we are so swiftly passing away, and giving our
places on earth, to new men and women.Tramp, tramp, tramp, and on we go, from the cradle to the grave, without
stopping to reflect, that an old man is passing away every hour, and a
new one taking his place.Like drops of rain, descending upon the mountains, and hurrying down to
form the great river, running them off to the ocean, and then returning
in the clouds.New men come upon the stage of life as it were unobserved, and old ones
pass away in like manner, and thus the great river of life flows on.Were the change sudden, and all at once, it would shock the philosophy
of the human race.A few men live to witness the rise and fall of two
generations.Long years have intervened and the characters portrayed in
the preceding part of our story, have all passed away.Some of their descendants come upon the stage to fight the great battle
of life.Young Simon will first claim our attention; he is the only son of S. S.
Simon by a second wife, his mother is dead, and Young Simon is heir to a
large estate.The decade from eighteen hundred and forty to eighteen hundred and
fifty, is, perhaps, the most interesting decade in the history of the
settlement and progress of the Western States.In that era, the great motive power of our modern civilization, the iron
horse and the magnetic telegraph were put into successful operation,
across the broad and beautiful Western States.The history of the West and Southwest in the first half of the
nineteenth century, is replete with romance, or with truth stranger than
fiction.The sudden rise of a moneyed aristocracy in the West, furnishes
a theme for the pen of a historian of no mean ability.This American aristocracy, diverse from the aristocracy of the old
world, who stimulated by family pride, preserved the history of a long
line of ancestors, born to distinction, and holding the tenure of office
by inheritance, could trace the heroic deeds of their fathers back to
the dark ages, while some of our American aristocrats are unable to give
a true history of their grandfather.In the first half of the nineteenth century the cultivation of the cotton
plant in the Southern States assumed gigantic proportions.The Northern
States bartered their slaves for money, and the forest of the great
Mississippi river fell by the ax of the <DW52> man; salvation from the
_demons of want_ was preached by the <DW65> and the mule.Young Simon was a cotton planter, inheriting from his father four
plantations of one thousand acres, and more than six hundred slaves.Young Simon knew very little of the history of his family, and the
more he learned of it, the less he wanted to know.His father in his
lifetime, had learned the history of Roxie Daymon alias Roxie Fairfield,
up to the time she left Louisville, and had good reason to believe
that Roxie Daymon, or her descendants, also Suza Fairfield, or her
descendants still survived.But as we have said, S. S. Simon stood in
the half-way-house, between the honest man and the rogue.He reflected
upon the subject mathematically, as he said mentally, “Twenty thousand
dollars and twenty years interest--why!it would break me up; I wish to
die a _rich man_.”

And onward he strove, seasoned to hardship in early life, he slept but
little, the morning bell upon his plantations sounded its iron notes up
and down the Mississippi long before daylight every morning, that the
slaves might be ready to resume their work as soon as they could see.Simon's anxiety to die a _rich man_ had so worked upon his feelings for
twenty years, that he was a hard master and a keen financier.The time to die never entered his brain; for it was all absorbed
with the _die rich_ question.Unexpectedly to him, death's white face
appeared when least expected, from hard work, and exposure, S. S. Simon
was taken down with the _swamp fever_; down--down--down for a few days
and then the _crisis_, the last night of his suffering was terrible, the
attending physician and his only son stood by his bedside.All night he
was delirious, everything he saw was in the shape of Roxie Daymon,
every movement made about the bed, the dying man would cry, “_Take Roxie
Daymon away._”

Young Simon was entirely ignorant of his father's history--and the name
_Roxie Daymon_ made a lasting impression on his brain.Young Simon grew
up without being inured to any hardships, and his health was not good,
for he soon followed his father; during his short life he had everything
that heart could desire, except a family name and good health, the lack
of which made him almost as poor as the meanest of his slaves.Young Simon received some comfort in his last days from his cousin
Cæsar.Cæsar Simon was the son of the brother of S. S. Simon who died in
early life, leaving three children in West Tennessee.Cousin Cæsar was
raised by two penniless sisters, whom he always called “big-sis” and
“little-sis.” “Big-sis” was so called from being the eldest, and had the
care of cousin Cæsar's childhood.Cousin Cæsar manifested an imaginary
turn of mind in early childhood.He was, one day, sitting on his little
stool, by the side of the tub in which “big-sis” was washing, (for she
was a washer-woman,) gazing intently upon the surface of the water.“What in the world are you looking at C-a-e-s-a-r?” said the woman,
straightening up in astonishment.“Looking at them bubbles on the suds,” said the boy, gravely.“And what of the bubbles?” continued the woman.“I expected to see one of them burst into a l-o-a-f of b-r-e-a-d,” said
the child honestly.“Big-sis” took cousin Cæsar to the fire, went to the cupboard and cut
her last loaf of bread, and spread upon it the last mouthful of butter
she had in the world, and gave it cousin Cæsar.And thus he received his first lesson of reward for imagination which,
perhaps, had something to do with his after life.Cousin Cæsar detested work, but had a disposition to see the bottom of
everything.No turkey-hen or guinea fowl could make a nest that cousin
Cæsar could not find.He grew up mischievous, so much so that “big-sis”
 would occasionally thrash him.He would then run off and live with
“little-sis” until “little-sis” would better the instruction, for she
would whip also.He would then run back to live with “big-sis.” In this
way cousin Cæsar grew to thirteen years of age--too big to whip.He
then went to live with old Smith, who had a farm on the Tennessee river,
containing a large tract of land, and who hired a large quantity
of steam wood cut every season.Rob Roy was one of old Smith's wood
cutters--a bachelor well advanced in years, he lived alone in a cabin
made of poles, on old Smith's land.His sleeping couch was made with
three poles, running parallel with the wall of the cabin, and filled
with straw.He never wore any stockings and seldom wore a coat, winter
or summer.The furniture in his cabin consisted of a three-legged stool,
and a pine goods box.His ax was a handsome tool, and the only thing he
always kept brightly polished.He was a good workman at his profession
of cutting wood.He was a man that
seldom talked; he was faithful to work through the week, but spent
the Sabbath day drinking whisky.He went to the village every Saturday
evening and purchased one gallon of whisky, which he carried in a stone
jug to his cabin, and drank it all himself by Monday morning, when he
would be ready to go to work again.Old Rob Roy's habits haunted the
mind of cousin Cæsar, and he resolved to play a trick Upon the old
wood cutter.Old Smith had some _hard cider_ to which cousin Cæsar had
access.One lonesome Sunday cousin Cæsar stole Roy's jug half full
of whisky, poured the whisky out, re-filled the jug with cider, and
cautiously slipped it back into Roy's cabin.On Monday morning Rob Roy
refused to work, and was very mad.Old Smith demanded to know the
cause of the trouble.“You can't fool a man with _cider_ who loves
good _whisky_,” said Roy indignantly.Old Smith traced the trick up and
discharged cousin Cæsar.At twenty years of age we find Cousin Cæsar in Paducah, Kentucky,
calling himself Cole Conway, in company with one Steve Sharp--they were
partners--in the game, as they called it.In the back room of a saloon,
dimly lighted, one dark night, another party, more proficient in the
sleight of hand, had won the last dime in their possession.The sun had crossed the meridian on the other side of
the globe.Cole Conway and Steve Sharp crawled into an old straw shed,
in the suburbs, of the village, and were soon soundly sleeping.The
sun had silvered the old straw shed when Sharp awakened, and saw Conway
sitting up, as white as death's old horse.“What on earth is the matter,
Conway?” said Sharp, inquiringly.“I slumbered heavy in the latter end of night, and had a brilliant
dream, and awoke from it, to realize this old straw shed doth effect
me,” said Conway gravely.“I
dreamed that we were playing cards, and I was dealing out the deck; the
last card was mine, and it was very thick.Sharp, it looked like a
box, and with thumb and finger I pulled it open.In it there were
three fifty-dollar gold pieces, four four-dollar gold pieces, and ten
one-dollar gold pieces.I put the money in my pocket, and was listening
for you to claim half, as you purchased the cards.You said nothing more
than that 'them cards had been put up for men who sell prize cards.'I
took the money out again, when lo, and behold!one of the fifty-dollar
pieces had turned to a rule about eight inches long, hinged in the
middle.Looking at it closely I saw small letters engraved upon it,
which I was able to read--you know, Sharp, I learned to read by spelling
the names on steamboats--or that is the way I learned the letters of the
alphabet.The inscription directed me to a certain place, and there I
would find a steam carriage that could be run on any common road where
carriages are drawn by horses.It was
a beautiful carriage--with highly finished box--on four wheels, the box
was large enough for six persons to sit on the inside.The pilot sat
upon the top, steering with a wheel, the engineer, who was also fireman,
and the engine, sat on the aft axle, behind the passenger box.The whole
structure was very light, the boiler was of polished brass, and sat upon
end.The heat was engendered by a chemical combination of phosphorus
and tinder.The golden rule gave directions how to run the engine--by
my directions, Sharp, you was pilot and I was engineer, and we started
south, toward my old home.People came running out from houses and
fields to see us pass I saw something on the beautiful brass boiler that
looked like a slide door.I shoved it, and it slipped aside, revealing
the dial of a clock which told the time of day, also by a separate hand
and figures, told the speed at which the carriage was running.On the
right hand side of the dial I saw the figures 77.They were made of
India rubber, and hung upon two brass pins.I drew the slide door over
the dial except when I wished to look at the time of day, or the rate of
speed at which we were running, and every time I opened the door, one
of the figure 7's had fallen off the pin.I would replace it, and again
find it fallen off.So I concluded it was only safe to run seven miles
an hour, and I regulated to that speed.In a short time, I looked again,
and we were running at the rate of fifteen miles an hour.I knew that I
had not altered the gauge of steam.A hissing sound caused me to think
the water was getting low in the boiler.On my left I saw a brass handle
that resembled the handle of a pump.I
could hear the bubbling of the water.I look down at the dry road, and
said, mentally, 'no water can come from there.'It
so frightened me that I found myself wide awake.”

“Dreams are but eddies in the current of the mind, which cut off from
reflection's gentle stream, sometimes play strange, fantastic tricks.I have tumbled headlong down from high and rocky cliffs; cold-blooded
snakes have crawled 'round my limbs; the worms that eat through
dead men's flesh, have crawled upon my skin, and I have dreamed of
transportation beyond the shores of time.My last night's dream hoisted
me beyond my hopes, to let me fall and find myself in this d----old
straw shed.”

“The devil never dreams,” said Sharp, coolly, and then continued:
“Holy men of old dreamed of the Lord, but never of the devil, and to
understand a dream, we must be just to all the world, and to ourselves
before God.”

“I have a proposition to make to you, Conway?“_What?_” said Conway, eagerly.“If you will tell me in confidence, your true name and history, I will
give you mine,” said Sharp, emphatically.“Agreed,” said Conway, and
then continued, “as you made he proposition give us yours first.My father was called Brindle Bill, and once
lived in Shirt-Tail Bend, on the Mississippi.My mother was a sister of Sundown Hill, who lived in the same
neighborhood.So you see, I am a
come by-chance, and I have been going by chance all of my life.Now, I
have told you the God's truth, so far as I know it.Now make a clean
breast of it, Conway, and let us hear your pedigree,” said Brindle,
confidentially.My father's name was Cæsar Simon, and I bear
his name.I do not remember either of
them I was partly raised by my sisters, and the balance of the time I
have tried to raise myself, but it seems it will take me a Iong time
to _make a raise_--” at this point, Brindle interfered in breathless
suspense, with the inquiry, “Did you have an uncle named S. S. Simon?”

“I have heard my sister say as much,” continued Simon.“Then your dream is interpreted,” said Brindle, emphatically.“Your
Uncle, S. S. Simon, has left one of the largest estates in Arkansas,
and now you are on the steam wagon again,” said Brindle, slapping his
companion on the shoulder.Brindle had been instructed by his mother, and made Cousin Cæsar
acquainted with the outline of all the history detailed in this
narrative, except the history of Roxie Daymon _alias_ Roxie Fairfield,
in Chicago.The next day the two men were hired as hands to go down the river on a
flat-bottom boat.Roxie Daymon, whose death has been recorded, left an only daughter, now
grown to womanhood, and bearing her mother's name.Seated in the parlor
of one of the descendants of Aunt Patsy Perkins, in Chicago, we see her
sad, and alone; we hear the hall bell ring.“Show the Governor up,” said Roxie, sadly.The ever open
ear of the Angel of observation has only furnished us with the following
conversation:

“Everything is positively lost, madam, not a cent in the world.Every
case has gone against us, and no appeal, madam.You are left hopelessly
destitute, and penniless.Daymon should have employed me ten years
ago--but now, it is too late.Everything is gone, madam,” and the
Governor paused.“My mother was once a poor, penniless girl, and I can
bear it too,” said Roxie, calmly.“But you see,” said the Governor,
softening his voice; “you are a handsome young lady; your fortune is yet
to be made.For fifty dollars, madam, I can fix you up a _shadow_, that
will marry you off.You see the law has some _loop holes_ and--and in
your case, madam, it is no harm to take one; no harm, no harm, madam,”
 and the Governor paused again.Roxie looked at the man sternly, and
said: “I have no further use for a lawyer, Sir.”

“Any business hereafter, madam, that you may wish transacted, send your
card to No.77, Strait street,” and the Governor made a side move toward
the door, touched the rim of his hat and disappeared.It was in the golden month of October, and calm, smoky days of
Indian summer, that a party of young people living in Chicago, made
arrangements for a pleasure trip to New Orleans.There were four or five
young ladies in the party, and Roxie Daymon was one.She was handsome
and interesting--if her fortune _was gone_.The party consisted of the
moneyed aristocracy of the city, with whom Roxie had been raised and
educated.Every one of the party was willing to contribute and pay
Roxie's expenses, for the sake of her company.A magnificent steamer, of
the day, plying between St.Louis and New Orleans, was selected for
the carrier, three hundred feet in length, and sixty feet wide.The
passenger cabin was on the upper deck, nearly two hundred feet in
length; a guard eight feet wide, for a footway, and promenade on the
outside of the hall, extended on both sides, the fall length of the
cabin; a plank partition divided the long hall--the aft room was the
ladies', the front the gentlemen's cabin.The iron horse, or some of
his successors, will banish these magnificent floating palaces, and I
describe, for the benefit of coming generations.Nothing of interest occured to our party, until the boat landed at the
Simon plantations.Young Simon and cousin Cæsar boarded the boat, for
passage to New Orleans, for they were on their way to the West Indies,
to spend the winter.Young Simon was in the last stage of consumption
and his physician had recommended the trip as the last remedy.Young
Simon was walking on the outside guard, opposite the ladies' cabin, when
a female voice with a shrill and piercing tone rang upon his ear--“_Take
Roxie Daymon away_.” The girls were romping.--“Take Roxie Daymon away,”
 were the mysterious dying words of young Simon's father.Simon turned,
and mentally bewildered, entered the gentlemen's cabin.A <DW52> boy,
some twelve years of age, in the service of the boat, was passing--Simon
held a silver dollar in his hand as he said, “I will give you this, if
you will ascertain and point out to me the lady in the cabin, that they
call _Roxie Daymon_.” The imp of Africa seized the coin, and passing on
said in a voice too low for Simon's ear, “good bargain, boss.” The Roman
Eagle was running down stream through the dark and muddy waters of the
Mississippi, at the rate of twenty miles an hour.In the dusk of the evening, Young Simon and Roxie Daymon were sitting
side by side--alone, on the aft-guard of the boat.The ever open ear
of the Angel of observation has furnished us with the following
conversation..

“Your mother's maiden name, is what I am anxious to learn,” said Simon
gravely.“Roxie Fairfield, an orphan girl, raised in Kentucky,” said Roxie sadly.“Was she an only child, or did she have sisters?” said Simon
inquiringly.“My mother died long years ago--when I was too young to remember,
my father had no relations--that I ever heard of--Old aunt Patsey
Perkins--a great friend of mother's in her life-time, told me after
mother was dead, and I had grown large enough to think about kinsfolk,
that mother had two sisters somewhere, named Rose and Suza, _poor
trash_, as she called them; and that is all I know of my relations: and
to be frank with you, I am nothing but poor trash too, I have no family
history to boast of,” said Roxie honestly.“You will please excuse me Miss, for wishing to know something of your
family history--there is a mystery connected with it, that may prove
to your advantage”--Simon was _convinced_.--He pronounced the
word twenty--when the Angel of caution placed his finger on his
lip--_hush!_--and young Simon turned the conversation, and as soon as
he could politely do so, left the presence of the young lady, and sought
cousin Cæsar, who by the way, was well acquainted with the most of the
circumstances we have recorded, but had wisely kept them to himself.Cousin Cæsar now told young Simon the whole story.Twenty-thousand dollars, with twenty years interest, was against his
estate.Roxie Daymon, the young lady on the boat, was an heir, others
lived in Kentucky--all of which cousin Cæsar learned from a descendant
of Brindle Bill.The pleasure party with Simon and cousin Cæsar, stopped
at the same hotel in the Crescent City.At the end of three weeks the
pleasure party returned to Chicago.Young Simon and cousin Cæsar left
for the West Indies.--Young Simon and Roxie Daymon were engaged to be
married the following spring at Chicago.Simon saw many beautiful women
in his travels--but the image of Roxie Daymon was ever before him.The
good Angel of observation has failed to inform us, of Roxie Daymon's
feelings and object in the match.A young and beautiful woman; full of
life and vigor consenting to wed a dying man, _hushed_ the voice of the
good Angel, and he has said nothing.Spring with its softening breezes returned--the ever to be remembered
spring of 1861.The shrill note of the iron horse announced the arrival of young Simon
and cousin Cæsar in Chicago, on the 7th day of April, 1861.Simon had lived upon excitement, and reaching the destination of his
hopes--the great source of his life failed--cousin Cæsar carried
him into the hotel--he never stood alone again--the marriage was put
off--until Simon should be better.On the second day, cousin Cæsar was
preparing to leave the room, on business in a distant part of the city.Roxie had been several times alone with Simon, and was then present.Roxie handed a sealed note to cousin Cæsar, politely asking him to
deliver it.Cousin Cæsar had been absent but a short time, when that limb of the law
appeared and wrote a will dictated by young Simon; bequeathing all
of his possessions, without reserve to Roxie Daymon.“How much,” said
Roxie, as the Governor was about to leave.“Only ten dollars, madam,”
 said the Governor, as he stuffed the bill carelessly in his vest pocket
and departed.Through the long vigils of the night cousin Cæsar sat by the side of the
dying man; before the sun had silvered the eastern horizon, the soul
of young Simon was with his fathers.The day was consumed in making
preparations for the last, honor due the dead.Cousin Cæsar arranged
with a party to take the remains to Arkansas, and place the son by the
side of the father, on the home plantation.The next morning as cousin
Cæsar was scanning the morning papers, the following brief notice
attracted his attention: “Young Simon, the wealthy young cotton planter,
who died in the city yesterday, left by his last will and testament his
whole estate, worth more than a million of dollars, to Roxie Daymon, a
young lady of this city.”

Cousin Cæsar was bewildered and astonished.He was a stranger in the
city; he rubbed his hand across his forehead to collect his thoughts,
and remembered No.“Yes I observed it--it is a
law office,” he said mentally, “there is something in that number
seventy-seven, I have never understood it before, since my dream on the
steam carriage _seventy-seven_,” and cousin Cæsar directed his steps
toward Strait street.“Important business, I suppose sir,” said Governor Mo-rock, as he read
cousin Cæsar's anxious countenance.“Yes, somewhat so,” said cousin Cæsar, pointing to the notice in the
paper, he continued: “I am a relative of Simon and have served him
faithfully for two years, and they say he has willed his estate to a
stranger.”

“Is it p-o-s-s-i-b-l-e-,” said the Governor, affecting astonishment.“What would you advise me to do?” said cousin Cæsar imploringly.“Break the will--break the will, sir,” said the Governor emphatically.that will take money,” said cousin Cæsar sadly.“Yes, yes, but it will bring money,” said the Governor, rubbing his
hands together.“I s-u-p p-o-s-e we would be required to prove incapacity on the part of
Simon,” said cousin Cæsar slowly.“Money will prove anything,” said the Governor decidedly.The Governor struck the right key, for cousin Cæsar was well schooled in
treacherous humanity, and noted for seeing the bottom of things; but he
did not see the bottom of the Governor's dark designs.“How much for this case?” said cousin Cæsar.I am liberal--I am liberal,” said the Governor rubbing his hands
and continuing, “can't tell exactly, owing to the trouble and cost of
the things, as we go along.A million is the stake--well, let me see,
this is no child's play.A man that has studied for long years--you
can't expect him to be cheap--but as I am in the habit of working for
nothing--if you will pay me one thousand dollars in advance, I will
undertake the case, and then a few more thousands will round it
up--can't say exactly, any more sir, than I am always liberal.”

Cousin Cæsar had some pocket-money, furnished by young Simon, to pay
expenses etc., amounting to a little more than one thousand dollars.His
mind was bewildered with the number seventy-seven, and he paid over to
the Governor one thousand dollars.After Governor Morock had the money
safe in his pocket, he commenced a detail of the cost of the suit--among
other items, was a large amount for witnesses.The Governor had the case--it was a big case--and the Governor has
determined to make it pay him.Cousin Caeser reflected, and saw that he must have help, and as he left
the office of Governor Morock, said mentally: “One of them d--n figure
sevens I saw in my dream, would fall off the pin, and I fear, I have
struck the wrong lead.”

In the soft twilight of the evening, when the conductor cried, “all
aboard,” cousin Cæsar was seated in the train, on his way to Kentucky,
to solicit aid from Cliff Carlo, the oldest son and representative man,
of the family descended from Don Carlo, the hero of Shirt-Tail Bend, and
Suza Fairfield, the belle of Port William.SCENE SEVENTH--WAR BETWEEN THE STATES.|The late civil war between the States of the American Union was the
inevitable result of two civilizations under one government, which no
power on earth could have prevented We place the federal and confederate
soldier in the same scale _per se_, and one will not weigh the other
down an atom.So even will they poise that you may mark the small allowance of the
weight of a hair.But place upon the beam the pea of their actions while
upon the stage, _on either side_, an the poise may be up or down.More than this, your orator has nothing to say of the war, except its
effect upon the characters we describe.The bright blossoms of a May morning were opening to meet the sunlight,
while the surrounding foliage was waving in the soft breeze ol spring;
on the southern bank of the beautiful Ohio, where the momentous events
of the future were concealed from the eyes of the preceding generation
by the dar veil of the coming revolutions of the globe.We see Cousin Cæsar and Cliff Carlo in close counsel, upon the subject
of meeting the expenses of the contest at law over the Simon estate, in
the State of Arkansas.Cliff Carlo was rather non-committal.Roxie Daymon was a near relative,
and the unsolved problem in the case of compromise and law did not admit
of haste on the part of the Carlo family.Compromise was not the forte
of Cousin Cæsar, To use his own words, “I have made the cast, and will
stand the hazard of the die.”

But the enterprise, with surrounding circumstances, would have baffled a
bolder man than Cæsar Simon.The first gun of the war had been fired at
Fort Sumter, in South Carolina, on the 12th day of April, 1861.The President of the United States had called for seventy-five thousand
war-like men to rendezvous at Washington City, and form a _Praetorian_
guard, to strengthen the arm of the government._To arms, to arms!_ was
the cry both North and South.The last lingering hope of peace between
the States had faded from the minds of all men, and the bloody crest of
war was painted on the horizon of the future.The border slave States,
in the hope of peace, had remained inactive all winter.They now
withdrew from the Union and joined their fortunes with the South,
except Kentucky--the _dark and bloody ground_ historic in the annals
of war--showed the _white feather_, and announced to the world that her
soil was the holy ground of peace.This proclamation was _too thin_
for Cæsar Simon.Some of the Carlo family had long since immigrated
to Missouri.To consult with them on the war affair, and meet with an
element more disposed to defend his prospect of property, Cousin
Cæsar left Kentucky for Missouri.On the fourth day of July, 1861,
in obedience to the call of the President, the Congress of the United
States met at Washington City.This Congress called to the contest five
hundred thousand men; “_cried havoc and let slip the dogs of war_,” and
Missouri was invaded by federal troops, who were subsequently put under
the command of Gen.About the middle of July we see Cousin Cæsar
marching in the army of Gen.Sterling Price--an army composed of all
classes of humanity, who rushed to the conflict without promise of
pay or assistance from the government of the Confederate States of
America--an army without arms or equipment, except such as it gathered
from the citizens, double-barreled shot-guns--an army of volunteers
without the promise of pay or hope of reward; composed of men from
eighteen to seventy years of age, with a uniform of costume varying from
the walnut  roundabout to the pigeon-tailed broadcloth coat.The
mechanic and the farmer, the professional and the non-professional,'
the merchant and the jobber, the speculator and the butcher, the country
schoolmaster and the printer's devil, the laboring man and the dead
beat, all rushed into Price's army, seemingly under the influence of the
watchword of the old Jews, “_To your tents, O Israeli_” and it is a
fact worthy of record that this unarmed and untrained army never lost a
battle on Missouri soil in the first year of the war.Jackson
had fled from Jefferson City on the approach of the federal army, and
assembled the Legislature at Neosho, in the southwest corner of the
State, who were unable to assist Price's army.The troops went into the
field, thrashed the wheat and milled it for themselves; were often upon
half rations, and frequently lived upon roasting ears.Except the Indian
or border war in Kentucky, fought by a preceding generation, the first
year of the war in Missouri is unparalleled in the history of war
on this continent.Price managed to subsist an army without
governmental resources.His men were never demoralized for the want of
food, pay or clothing, and were always cheerful, and frequently danced
'round their camp-fires, bare-footed and ragged, with a spirit of
merriment that would put the blush upon the cheek of a circus.Price wore nothing upon his shoulders but a brown linen duster, and, his
white hair streaming in the breeze on the field of battle, was a picture
resembling the _war-god_ of the Romans in ancient fable.* The so called battle of Boonville was a rash venture of
     citizens, not under the command of Gen.This army of ragged heroes marched over eight hundred miles on Missouri
soil, and seldom passed a week without an engagement of some kind--it
was confined to no particular line of operations, but fought the enemy
wherever they found him.It had started on the campaign without a
dollar, without a wagon, without a cartridge, and without a bayonet-gun;
and when it was called east of the Mississippi river, it possessed about
eight thousand bayonet-guns, fifty pieces of cannon, and four hundred
tents, taken almost exclusively from the Federals, on the hard-fought
fields of battle.When this army crossed the Mississippi river the star of its glory had
set never to rise again.The invigorating name of _state rights_ was
_merged_ in the Southern Confederacy.With this prelude to surrounding circumstances, we will now follow the
fortunes of Cousin Cæsar.Enured to hardships in early life, possessing
a penetrating mind and a selfish disposition, Cousin Cæsar was ever
ready to float on the stream of prosperity, with triumphant banners, or
go down as _drift wood_.And whatever he may have lacked in manhood, he was as brave as a lion on
the battle-field; and the campaign of Gen.Price in Missouri suited no
private soldier better than Cæsar Simon.Like all soldiers in an active
army, he thought only of battle and amusement.Consequently, the will,
Gov.Morock and the Simon estate occupied but little of Cousin Cæsar's
reflections.One idea had taken possession of him, and that was southern
victory.He enjoyed the triumphs of his fellow soldiers, and ate his
roasting ears with the same invigorating spirit.A sober second thought
and cool reflections only come with the struggle for his own life, and
with it a self-reproach that always, sooner or later, overtakes the
faithless.The battle of Oak Hill, usually called the battle of Springfield, was
one of the hardest battles fought west of the Mississippi river.Lyon, amounted to nearly ten thousand men.The confederate t oops, under Generals McCulloch, Price, and Pearce,
were about eleven thousand men.On the ninth of August the Confederates camped at Wilson's Creek,
intending to advance upon the Federals at Springfield.The next morning
General Lyon attacked them before sunrise.The battle was fought with
rash bravery on both sides.General Lyon, after having been twice
wounded, was shot dead while leading a rash charge.Half the loss on the
Confederate side was from Price's army--a sad memorial of the part they
took in the contest.Soon after the fall of General Lyon the Federals
retreated to Springfield, and left the Confederates master of the field.About the closing scene of the last struggle, Cousin Cæsar received a
musket ball in the right leg, and fell among the wounded and dying.The wound was not necessarily fatal; no bone was broken, but it was very
painful and bleeding profusely.When Cousin Cæsar, after lying a
long time where he fell, realized the situation, he saw that without
assistance he must bleed to death; and impatient to wait for some one to
pick him up, he sought quarters by his own exertions.He had managed to
crawl a quarter of a mile, and gave out at a point where no one would
think of looking for the wounded.Weak from the loss of blood, he could
crawl no farther.The light of day was only discernable in the dim
distance of the West; the Angel of silence had spread her wing over
the bloody battle field.In vain Cousin Cæsar pressed his hand upon the
wound; the crimson life would ooze out between his fingers, and Cousin
Cæsar lay down to die.It was now dark; no light met his eye, and no
sound came to his ear, save the song of two grasshoppers in a cluster of
bushes--one sang “Katie-did!” and the other sang “Katie-didn't!” Cousin
Cæsar said, mentally, “It will soon be decided with me whether Katie did
or whether she didn't!” In the last moments of hope Cousin Cæsar heard
and recognized the sound of a human voice, and gathering all the
strength of his lungs, pronounced the word--“S-t-e-v-e!” In a short
time he saw two men approaching him.It was Steve Brindle and a Cherokee
Indian.As soon as they saw the situation, the Indian darted like a wild
deer to where there had been a camp fire, and returned with his cap full
of ashes which he applied to Cousin Cæsar's wound.Steve Brindle bound
it up and stopped the blood.The two men then carried the wounded man to
camp--to recover and reflect upon the past.Steve Brindle was a private,
in the army of General Pearce, from Arkansas, and the Cherokee Indian
was a camp follower belonging to the army of General McCulloch.They
were looking over the battle field in search of their missing friends,
when they accidentally discovered and saved Cousin Cæsar.Early in the month of September, Generals McCulloch and Price having
disagreed on the plan of campaign, General Price announced to his
officers his intention of moving north, and required a report of
effective men in his army.A lieutenant, after canvassing the company to
which Cousin Cæsar belonged, went to him as the last man.Cousin Cæsar
reported ready for duty.“All right, you are the last man--No.77,” said
the lieutenant, hastily, leaving Cousin Cæsar to his reflections.“There
is that number again; what can it mean?Marching north, perhaps to
meet a large force, is our company to be reduced to seven?One of them
d------d figure sevens would fall off and one would be left on the pin.How should it be counted--s-e-v-e-n or half?Set up two guns and take
one away, half would be left; enlist two men, and if one is killed, half
would be left--yet, with these d------d figures, when you take one you
only have one eleventh part left.Cut by the turn of fortune; cut with
short rations; cut with a musket ball; cut by self-reproach--_ah, that's
the deepest cut of all!_” said Cousin Cæsar, mentally, as he retired to
the tent.Steve Brindle had saved Cousin Cæsar's life, had been an old comrade
in many a hard game, had divided his last cent with him in many hard
places; had given him his family history and opened the door for him to
step into the palace of wealth.Yet, when Cousin Cæsar was surrounded
with wealth and power, when honest employment would, in all human
possibility, have redeemed his old comrade, Cousin Cæsar, willing to
conceal his antecedents, did not know S-t-e-v-e Brindle.General Price reached the Missouri river, at Lexington, on the 12th of
September, and on the 20th captured a Federal force intrenched there,
under the command of Colonel Mulligan, from whom he obtained five
cannon, two mortars and over three thousand bayonet guns.In fear
of large Federal forces north of the Missouri river, General Price
retreated south.Cousin Cæsar was again animated with the spirit of
war and had dismissed the superstitious fear of 77 from his mind.He
continued his amusements round the camp fires in Price's army, as he
said, mentally, “Governor Morock will keep things straight, at his
office on Strait street, in Chicago.”

Roxie Daymon had pleasantly passed the summer and fall on the reputation
of being _rich_, and was always the toast in the fashionable parties
of the upper-ten in Chicago.During the first year of the war it was
emphatically announced by the government at Washington, that it would
never interfere with the slaves of loyal men.Roxie Daymon was loyal
and lived in a loyal city.It was war times, and Roxie had received no
dividends from the Simon estate.In the month of January, 1862, the cold north wind from the lakes swept
the dust from the streets in Chicago, and seemed to warn the secret,
silent thoughts of humanity of the great necessity of m-o-n-e-y.The good Angel of observation saw Roxie Daymon, with a richly-trimmed
fur cloak upon her shoulders and hands muffed, walking swiftly on Strait
street, in Chicago, watching the numbers--at No.The good Angel opened his ear and has furnished us with the following
conversation;

“I have heard incidentally that Cæsar Simon is preparing to break the
will of my _esteemed_ friend, Young Simon, of Arkansas,” said Roxie,
sadly.“Is it p-o-s s-i-b-l-e?” said Governor Morock, affecting astonishment,
and then continued, “More work for the lawyers, you know I am always
liberal, madam.”

“But do you think it possible?” said Roxie, inquiringly.“You have money
enough to fight with, madam, money enough to fight,” said the Governor,
decidedly.“I suppose we will have to prove that Simon was in full
possession of his mental faculties at the time,” said Roxie, with legal
_acumen_.“Certainly, certainly madam, money will prove anything; will
prove anything, madam,” said the Governor, rubbing his hands.“I believe
you were the only person present at the time,” said Roxie, honestly.“I am always liberal, madam, a few thousands will arrange the testimony,
madam.Leave that to me, if you please,” and in a softer tone of voice
the Governor continued, “you ought to pick up the _crumbs_, madam, pick
up the crumbs.”

“I would like to do so for I have never spent a cent in the prospect of
the estate, though my credit is good for thousands in this city.. I want
to see how a dead man's shoes will fit before I wear them,” said Roxie,
sadly.“Good philosophy, madam, good philosophy,” said the Governor, and
continued to explain.“There is cotton on the bank of the river at the
Simon plantations.Some arrangement ought to be made, and I think
I could do it through some officer of the federal army,” said the
Governor, rubbing his hand across his forehead, and continued, “that's
what I mean by picking up the crumbs, madam.”

“_How much?_” said Roxie, preparing to leave the office.“I m always liberal, madam, always liberal.Let me see; it is attended
with some difficulty; can't leave the city; too much business pressing
(rubbing his hands); well--well--I will pick up the crumbs for half.Think I can secure two or three hundred bales of cotton, madam,” said
the Governor, confidentially.“How much is a bale of cotton worth?” said Roxie, affecting ignorance.“Only four hundred dollars, madam; nothing but a crumb--nothing but a
crumb, madam,” said the Governor, in a tone of flattery.“Do the best you can,” said Roxie, in a confidential tone, as she left
the office.Governor Morock was enjoying the reputation of the fashionable lawyer
among the upper-ten in Chicago.Roxie Daymon's good sense condemned him,
but she did not feel at liberty to break the line of association.Cliff Carlo did nothing but write a letter of inquiry to Governor
Morock, who informed him that the Simon estate was worth more than a
million and a quarter, and that m-o-n-e-y would _break the will_.The second year of the war burst the bubble of peace in Kentucky.The clang of arms on the soil where the
heroes of a preceding generation slept, called the martial spirits in
the shades of Kentucky to rise and shake off the delusion that peace and
plenty breed cowards.Cliff Carlo, and many others of the brave sons of
Kentucky, united with the southern armies, and fully redeemed their war
like character, as worthy descendents of the heroes of the _dark and
bloody ground_.Cliff Carlo passed through the struggles of the war without a sick day
or the pain of a wound.We must, therefore, follow the fate of the less
fortunate Cæsar Simon.During the winter of the first year of the war, Price's army camped on
the southern border of Missouri.On the third day of March, 1862, Maj.Earl Van Dorn, of the
Confederate government, assumed the command of the troops under Price
and McCulloch, and on the seventh day of March attacked the Federal
forces under Curtis and Sturgis, twenty-five thousand strong, at
Elkhorn, Van Dorn commanding about twenty thousand men.Price's army constituted the left and center, with McCulloch on the
right.About two o'clock McCulloch
fell, and his forces failed to press the contest.The Federals retreated in good order, leaving the Confederates master of
the situation.For some unaccountable decision on the part of Gen.Van Dorn, a retreat
of the southern army was ordered, and instead of pursuing the Federals,
the wheels of the Southern army were seen rolling south.Van Dorn had ordered the sick and disabled many miles in advance of
the army.Cousin Cæsar had passed through the conflict safe and sound;
it was a camp rumor that Steve Brindle was mortally wounded and sent
forward with the sick.The mantle of night hung over Price's army, and
the camp fires glimmered in the soft breeze of the evening.Silently and
alone Cousin Cæsar stole away from the scene on a mission of love and
duty.Poor Steve Brindle had ever been faithful to him, and Cousin Cæsar
had suffered self-reproach for his unaccountable neglect of a faithful
friend.An opportunity now presented itself for Cousin Cæsar to relieve
his conscience and possibly smooth the dying pillow of his faithful
friend, Steve Brindle.Bravely and fearlessly on he sped and arrived at the camp of the sick.Worn down with the march, Cousin Cæsar never rested until he had looked
upon the face of the last sick man.Slowly and sadly Cousin Cæsar returned to the army, making inquiry of
every one he met for Steve Brindle.After a long and fruitless inquiry,
an Arkansas soldier handed Cousin Cæsar a card, saying, “I was
requested by a soldier in our command to hand this card to the man whose
name it bears, in Price's army.” Cousin Cæsar took the card and read,
“Cæsar Simon--No.77 deserted.” Cousin Cæsar threw the card down as
though it was nothings as he said mentally, “What can it mean.There are
those d----d figures again.Steve understood my ideas of the mysterious
No.Steve has deserted and takes this plan
to inform me.that is it!_ Steve has couched the information in
language that no one can understand but myself.Two of us were on the
carriage and two figure sevens; one would fall off the pin.He knew I would understand his card when no one else could.But did Steve only wish me to understand that he had left, or did he
wish me to follow?” was a problem Cousin Cæsar was unable to decide.It
was known to Cousin Cæsar that the Cherokee Indian who, in company with
Steve, saved his life at Springfield, had, in company with some of his
race, been brought upon the stage of war by Albert Pike.And
Cousin Cæsar was left alone, with no bosom friend save the friendship
of one southern soldier for another.And the idea of _desertion_ entered
the brain of Cæsar Simon for the first time.Cæsar Simon was a born soldier, animated by the clang of arms and roar
of battle, and although educated in the school of treacherous humanity,
he was one of the few who resolved to die in the last ditch, and he
concluded his reflections with the sarcastic remark, “Steve Brindle is a
coward.”

Before Gen.Van Dorn faced the enemy again, he was called east of the
Mississippi river.Price's army embarked at Des Arc, on White river, and
when the last man was on board the boats, there were none more cheerful
than Cousin Cæsar.He was going to fight on the soil of his native
State, for it was generally understood the march by water was to
Memphis, Tennessee.It is said that a portion of Price's army showed the _white feather_
at Iuka.Cousin Cæsar was not in that division of the army.After that
event he was a camp lecturer, and to him the heroism of the army owes
a tribute in memory for the brave hand to hand fight in the streets
of Corinth, where, from house to house and within a stone's throw of
Rosecrans'' headquarters, Price's men made the Federals fly.But the
Federals were reinforced from their outposts, and Gen.Van Dorn was in
command, and the record says he made a rash attack and a hasty retreat.T. C. Hindman was the southern commander of what was called
the district of Arkansas west of the Mississippi river.He was a petty
despot as well as an unsuccessful commander of an army.The country
suffered unparalleled abuses; crops were ravaged, cotton burned, and
the magnificent palaces of the southern planter licked up by flames.The
torch was applied frequently by an unknown hand.The Southern commander
burned cotton to prevent its falling into the hands of the enemy.Straggling soldiers belonging to distant commands traversed the country,
robbing the people and burning.How much of this useless destruction
is chargable to Confederate or Federal commanders, it is impossible to
determine.Much of the waste inflicted upon the country was by the hand
of lawless guerrillas.Four hundred bales of cotton were burned on the
Simon plantation, and the residence on the home plantation, that cost
S. S. Simon over sixty-five thousand dollars, was nothing but a heap of

had used nearly all of the thousand dollars obtained from Cousin
Cæsar to pick up the _crumbs_ on the Simon plantations, he never got a
_crumb_.General Hindman was relieved of his command west of the Mississippi, by
President Davis.Generals Kirby, Smith, Holmes and Price subsequently
commanded the Southern troops west of the great river.The federals had
fortified Helena, a point three hundred miles above Vicks burg on the
west bank of the river.They had three forts with a gun-boat lying in
the river, and were about four thousand strong.They were attacked by
General Holmes, on the 4th day of July, 1863.General Holmes had under
his command General Price's division of infantry, about fourteen hundred
men; Fagans brigade of Arkansas, infantry, numbering fifteen hundred
men, and Marmaduke's division of Arkansas, and Missouri cavalry, about
two thousand, making a total of four thousand and nine hundred men.Marmaduke was ordered to attack the northern fort; Fagan was to attack
the southern fort, and General Price the center fort.The onset to be
simultaneously and at daylight.The
gun-boat in the river shelled the captured fort.Price's men sheltered
themselves as best they could, awaiting further orders.The scene
was alarming above description to Price's men.The failure of their comrades in arms would
compel them to retreat under a deadly fire from the enemy.While thus
waiting, the turn of battle crouched beneath an old stump.Cousin Cæsar
saw in the distance and recognized Steve Brindle, he was a soldier in
the federal army.must I live to learn thee still Steve Brindle
fights for m-o-n-e-y?” said Cæsar Simon, mentally.The good Angel
of observation whispered in his car: “Cæsar Simon fights for land
_stripped of its ornaments._” Cousin Cæsar scanned the situation and
continued to say, mentally: “Life is a sentence of punishment passed by
the court of existence on every _private soldier_.”

The battle field is the place of execution, and rash commanders are
often the executioners.After repeated efforts General Holmes failed to
carry the other positions.The retreat of Price's men was ordered;
it was accomplished with heavy loss.Cæsar Simon fell, and with him
perished the last link in the chain of the Simon family in the male
line.We must now let the curtain fall upon the sad events of the war until
the globe makes nearly two more revolutions 'round the sun in its
orbit, and then we see the Southern soldiers weary and war-worn--sadly
deficient in numbers--lay down their arms--the war is ended.The Angel
of peace has spread her golden wing from Maine to Florida, and from
Virginia to California.The proclamation of freedom, by President
Lincoln, knocked the dollars and cents out of the flesh and blood of

THE ROUGH DIAMOND."Casting his eyes upward, the minister could just discern the animal
standing on the end of the sounding-board, and gesturing with all his
might, when he found it difficult to control himself, though highly
exasperated at the occurrence.He gave directions to have the monkey
removed, and sat down to compose himself, and allow his congregation to
recover their equanimity while the order was being obeyed."CHAPTER V.

JACKO IN THE PANTRY.In his frequent visits to the stable, Jacko amused himself by catching
mice that crept out to pick up the corn.The servants, having noticed his skill, thought they would turn it to
good account, and having been troubled with mice in the pantry,
determined to take advantage of the absence of Mrs.Lee on a journey,
and shut the monkey up in it.So, one evening, they took him out of his
comfortable bed, and chained him up in the larder, having removed every
thing except some jam pots, which they thought out of his reach, and
well secured with bladder stretched over the top.Poor Jacko was evidently much astonished, and quite indignant, at this
treatment, but presently consoled himself by jumping into a soup
tureen, where he fell sound asleep, while the mice scampered all over
the place.As soon as it was dawn, the mice retired to their holes.Jacko awoke
shivering with cold, stretched himself, and then, pushing the soup
tureen from the shelf, broke it to pieces.After this achievement, he
began to look about for something to eat, when he spied the jam pots on
the upper shelf."There is something good," he thought, smelling them.His sharp teeth soon worked an entrance, when the treasured jams, plums,
raspberry, strawberry, candied apricots, the pride and care of the cook,
disappeared in an unaccountably short time.At last, his appetite for sweets was satisfied, and coiling his tail in
a corner, he lay quietly awaiting the servant's coming to take him out.Presently he heard the door cautiously open, when the chamber girl gave
a scream of horror as she saw the elegant China dish broken into a
thousand bits, and lying scattered on the floor.She ran in haste to summon Hepsy and the nurse, her heart misgiving her
that this was not the end of the calamity.They easily removed Jacko,
who began already to experience the sad effects of overloading his
stomach, and then found, with alarm and grief, the damage he had done.For several days the monkey did not recover from the effects of his
excess.He was never shut up again in the pantry.Lee returned she blamed the servants for trying such an
experiment in her absence.Jacko was now well, and ready for some new
mischief; and Minnie, who heard a ludicrous account of the story,
laughed till she cried.She repeated it, in great glee, to her father, who looked very grave as
he said, "We think a sea voyage would do the troublesome fellow good;
but you shall have a Canary or a pair of Java sparrows instead.""Don't you know any stories of good monkeys, father?""I don't recollect any at this moment, my dear; but I will see whether I
can find any for you."He opened the book, and then asked,--

"Did you know, Minnie, that almost all monkeys have bags or pouches in
their cheeks, the skin of which is loose, and when empty makes the
animal look wrinkled?""No, sir; I never heard about it."He puts his food in them, and keeps it there
till he wishes to devour it."There are some kinds, too, that have what is called prehensile tails;
that is, tails by which they can hang themselves to the limb of a tree,
and which they use with nearly as much ease as they can their hands.The
facility which this affords them for moving about quickly among the
branches of trees is astonishing.The firmness of the grasp which it
makes is very surprising; for if it winds a single coil around a branch,
it is quite sufficient, not only to support its weight, but to enable it
to swing in such a manner as to gain a fresh hold with its feet.""I'm sure, father," eagerly cried Minnie, "that Jacko has a prehensile
tail, for I have often seen him swing from the ladder which goes up the
hay mow."But here is an
account of an Indian monkey, of a light grayish yellow color, with black
hands and feet.The face is black, with a violet tinge.This is called
Hoonuman, and is much venerated by the Hindoos.They believe it to be
one of the animals into which the souls of their friends pass at death.If one of these monkeys is killed, the murderer is instantly put to
death; and, thus protected, they become a great nuisance, and destroy
great quantities of fruit.But in South America, monkeys are killed by
the natives as game, for the sake of the flesh.Absolute necessity alone
would compel us to eat them.A great naturalist named Humboldt tells us
that their manner of cooking them is especially disgusting.They are
raised a foot from the ground, and bent into a sitting position, in
which they greatly resemble a child, and are roasted in that manner.A
hand and arm of a monkey, roasted in this way, are exhibited in a museum
in Paris.""Monkeys have a curious way of introducing their tails into the fissures
or hollows of trees, for the purpose of hooking out eggs and other
substances.On approaching a spot where there is a supply of food, they
do not alight at once, but take a survey of the neighborhood, a general
cry being kept up by the party."One afternoon, Minnie ran out of breath to the parlor."Mamma," she
exclaimed, "cook says monkeys are real cruel in their families."I suppose, my dear," she responded, "that there is a
difference of disposition among them.I have heard that they are very
fond of their young, and that, when threatened with danger, they mount
them on their back, or clasp them to their breast with great affection."But I saw lately an anecdote of the cruelty of a monkey to his wife,
and if I can find the book, I will read it to you.""There is an animal called the fair monkey, which, though the most
beautiful of its tribe, is gloomy and cruel.One of these, which, from
its extreme beauty and apparent gentleness, was allowed to ramble at
liberty over a ship, soon became a great favorite with the crew, and in
order to make him perfectly happy, as they imagined, they procured him a
wife."For some weeks, he was a devoted husband, and showed her every
attention and respect.He then grew cool, and began to use her with much
cruelty."One day, the crew noticed that he treated her with more kindness than
usual, but did not suspect the wicked scheme he had in mind.At last,
after winning her favor anew, he persuaded her to go aloft with him, and
drew her attention to an object in the distance, when he suddenly gave
her a push, which threw her into the sea."This cruel act seemed to afford him much gratification, for he
descended in high spirits.""I should think they would have punished him," said Minnie, with great
indignation.At any rate, it proves that beauty is by no
means always to be depended upon."Lee then took her sewing, but Minnie plead so earnestly for one
more story, a good long one, that her mother, who loved to gratify her,
complied, and read the account which I shall give you in closing this
chapter on Minnie's pet monkey."A gentleman, returning from India, brought a monkey, which he presented
to his wife.She called it Sprite, and soon became very fond of it."Sprite was very fond of beetles, and also of spiders, and his mistress
used sometimes to hold his chain, lengthened by a string, and make him
run up the curtains, and clear out the cobwebs for the housekeeper."On one occasion, he watched his opportunity, and snatching the chain,
ran off, and was soon seated on the top of a cottage, grinning and
chattering to the assembled crowd of schoolboys, as much as to say,
'Catch me if you can.'He got the whole town in an uproar, but finally
leaped over every thing, dragging his chain after him, and nestled
himself in his own bed, where he lay with his eyes closed, his mouth
open, his sides ready to burst with his running."Another time, the little fellow got loose, but remembering his former
experience, only stole into the shed, where he tried his hand at
cleaning knives.He did not succeed very well in this, however, for the
handle was the part he attempted to polish, and, cutting his fingers, he
relinquished the sport."Resolved not to be defeated, he next set to work to clean the shoes and
boots, a row of which were awaiting the boy.But Sprite, not remembering
all the steps of the performance, first covered the entire shoe, sole
and all, with the blacking, and then emptied the rest of the Day &
Martin into it, nearly filling it with the precious fluid.His coat was
a nice mess for some days after."One morning, when the servants returned to the kitchen, they found
Sprite had taken all the kitchen candlesticks out of the cupboard, and
arranged them on the fender, as he had once seen done.As soon as he
heard the servants returning, he ran to his basket, and tried to look as
though nothing had happened."Sprite was exceedingly fond of a bath.Occasionally a bowl of water was
given him, when he would cunningly try the temperature by putting in his
finger, after which he gradually stepped in, first one foot, then the
other, till he was comfortably seated.Then he took the soap and rubbed
himself all over.Having made a dreadful splashing all around, he jumped
out and ran to the fire, shivering.If any body laughed at him during
this performance, he made threatening gestures, chattering with all his
might to show his displeasure, and sometimes he splashed water all over
them.As he was brought from a
very warm climate, he often suffered exceedingly, in winter, from the
cold."The cooking was done by a large fire on the open hearth, and as his
basket, where he slept, was in one corner of the kitchen, before morning
he frequently awoke shivering and blue.The cook was in the habit of
making the fire, and then returning to her room to finish her toilet."One morning, having lighted the pile of kindlings as usual, she hung on
the tea-kettle and went out, shutting the door carefully behind her."Sprite thought this a fine opportunity to warm himself.He jumped from
his basket, ran to the hearth, and took the lid of the kettle off.Cautiously touching the water with the tip of his finger, he found it
just the right heat for a bath, and sprang in, sitting down, leaving
only his head above the water."This he found exceedingly comfortable for a time; but soon the water
began to grow hot.He rose, but the air outside was so cold, he quickly
sat down again.He did this several times, and would, no doubt, have
been boiled to death, and become a martyr to his own want of pluck and
firmness in action, had it not been for the timely return of the cook,
who, seeing him sitting there almost lifeless, seized him by the head
and pulled him out."He was rolled in blankets, and laid in his basket, where he soon
recovered, and, it is to be hoped, learned a lesson from this hot
experience, not to take a bath when the water is on the fire."When Minnie was nine years of age, she accompanied her parents to a
menagerie, and there, among other animals, she saw a baboon.She was
greatly excited by his curious, uncouth manoeuvres, asking twenty
questions about him, without giving her father time to answer.On their
way home, she inquired,--

"Are baboons one kind of monkeys, father?""Yes, my daughter; and a more disagreeable, disgusting animal I cannot
conceive of.""I hope you are not wishing for a baboon to add to your pets," added her
mother, laughing."I don't believe Jacko would get along with that great fellow at all,"
answered the child."But, father, will you please tell me something
more about the curious animals?"The conversation was here interrupted by seeing that a carriage had
stopped just in front of their own, and that quite a crowd had gathered
about some person who seemed to be hurt.Minnie's sympathies were alive in an instant.She begged her father to
get out, as possibly he might be of some use.The driver stopped of his own accord, and inquired what had happened,
and then they saw that it was a spaniel that was hurt.He had been in
the road, and not getting out of the way quick enough, the wheel had
gone over his body.The young lady who was in the buggy was greatly distressed, from which
Minnie argued that she was kind to animals, and that they should like
her.The owner of the dog held the poor creature in her arms, though it
seemed to be in convulsions, and wept bitterly as she found it must die.Lee, to please his little daughter, waited a few minutes; but he
found her getting so much excited over the suffering animal, he gave
John orders to proceed.During the rest of the drive, she could talk of nothing else, wondering
whether the spaniel was alive now, or whether the young man in the buggy
paid for hurting it.The next day, however, having made up her mind that the poor creature
must be dead, and his sufferings ended, and having given Tiney many
admonitions to keep out of the road when carriages were passing, her
thoughts turned once more to the baboon.Lee found in his library a book which gave a short account of the
animal, which he read to her."The baboon is of the monkey tribe, notwithstanding its long, dog-like
head, flat, compressed cheeks, and strong and projecting teeth.The form
and position of the eyes, combined with the similarity of the arms and
hands, give to these creatures a resemblance to humanity as striking as
it is disgusting.""Then follows an account," the gentleman went on, "of the peculiarities
of different kinds of baboons, which you would not understand.""But can't you tell me something about them yourself, father?""I know very little about the creatures, my dear; but I have read that
they are exceedingly strong, and of a fiery, vicious temper."They can never be wholly tamed, and it is only while restraint of the
severest kind is used, that they can be governed at all.If left to
their own will, their savage nature resumes its sway, and their actions
are cruel, destructive, and disgusting.""I saw the man at the menagerie giving them apples," said Minnie; "but
he did not give them any meat all the time I was there.""No; they subsist exclusively on fruits, seeds, and other vegetable
matter.In the countries where they live, especially near the Cape of
Good Hope, the inhabitants chase them with dogs and guns in order to
destroy them, on account of the ravages they commit in the fields and
gardens.It is said that they make a very obstinate resistance to the
dogs, and often have fierce battles with them; but they greatly fear the
gun."As the baboon grows older, instead of becoming better, his rage
increases, so that the slightest cause will provoke him to terrible
fury.""Why, Minnie, in order to satisfy you, any one must become a walking
encyclopaedia."Why, they must have something to eat, and how are they to get it unless
they go into gardens?""I rather think I should soon convince them they
were not to enter my garden," he said, emphatically."But seriously,
they descend in vast numbers upon the orchards of fruit, destroying, in
a few hours, the work of months, or even of years.In these excursions,
they move on a concerted plan, placing sentinels on commanding spots, to
give notice of the approach of an enemy.As soon as he perceives danger,
the sentinel gives a loud yell, and then the whole troop rush away with
the greatest speed, cramming the fruit which they have gathered into
their cheek pouches."Minnie looked so much disappointed when he ceased speaking, that her
mother said, "I read somewhere an account of a baboon that was named
Kees, who was the best of his kind that I ever heard of.""Yes, that was quite an interesting story, if you can call it to mind,"
said the gentleman, rising."It was in a book of travels in Africa," the lady went on."The
traveller, whose name was Le Vaillant, took Kees through all his
journey, and the creature really made himself very useful.As a
sentinel, he was better than any of the dogs.Indeed, so quick was his
sense of danger, that he often gave notice of the approach of beasts of
prey, when every thing was apparently secure."There was another way in which Kees made himself useful.Whenever they
came across any fruits or roots with which the Hottentots were
unacquainted, they waited to see whether Kees would taste them.If he
threw them down, the traveller concluded they were poisonous or
disagreeable, and left them untasted."Le Vaillant used to hunt, and frequently took Kees with him on these
excursions.The poor fellow understood the preparations making for the
sport, and when his master signified his consent that he should go, he
showed his joy in the most lively manner.On the way, he would dance
about, and then run up into the trees to search for gum, of which he was
very fond."I recall one amusing trick of Kees," said the lady, laughing, "which
pleased me much when I read it.He sometimes found honey in the hollows
of trees, and also a kind of root of which he was very fond, both of
which his master insisted on sharing with him.On such occasions, he
would run away with his treasure, or hide it in his pouches, or eat it
as fast as possible, before Le Vaillant could have time to reach him."These roots were very difficult to pull from the ground.Kees' manner
of doing it was this.He would seize the top of the root with his strong
teeth, and then, planting himself firmly against the sod, drew himself
gradually back, which forced it from the earth.If it proved stubborn,
while he still held it in his teeth he threw himself heels over head,
which gave such a concussion to the root that it never failed to come
out."Another habit that Kees had was very curious.He sometimes grew tired
with the long marches, and then he would jump on the back of one of the
dogs, and oblige it to carry him whole hours.At last the dogs grew
weary of this, and one of them determined not to be pressed into
service.As soon as Kees leaped on
his back, he stood still, and let the train pass without moving from the
spot.Kees sat quiet, determined that the dog should carry him, until
the party were almost out of sight, and then they both ran in great
haste to overtake their master."Kees established a kind of authority over the dogs.They were
accustomed to his voice, and in general obeyed without hesitation the
slightest motions by which he communicated his orders, taking their
places about the tent or carriage, as he directed them.If any of them
came too near him when he was eating, he gave them a box on the ear,
and thus compelled them to retire to a respectful distance.""Why, mother, I think Kees was a very good animal, indeed," said Minnie,
with considerable warmth."I have told you the best traits of his character," she answered,
smiling."He was, greatly to his master's sorrow, an incurable thief.He
could not be left alone for a moment with any kind of food.He
understood perfectly how to loose the strings of a basket, or to take
the cork from a bottle.He was very fond of milk, and would drink it
whenever he had a chance.He was whipped repeatedly for these
misdemeanors, but the punishment did him no good."Le Vaillant was accustomed to have eggs for his breakfast; but his
servants complained one morning there were none to be had.Whenever any
thing was amiss, the fault was always laid to Kees, who, indeed,
generally deserved it."The next morning, hearing the cackling of a hen, he started for the
place; but found Kees had been before him, and nothing remained but the
broken shell.Having caught him in his pilfering, his master gave him a
severe beating; but he was soon at his old habit again, and the
gentleman was obliged to train one of his dogs to run for the egg as
soon as it was laid, before he could enjoy his favorite repast."One day, Le Vaillant was eating his dinner, when he heard the voice of
a bird, with which he was not acquainted.Leaving the beans he had
carefully prepared for himself on his plate, he seized his gun, and ran
out of the tent.In a short time he returned, with the bird in his hand,
but found not a bean left, and Kees missing."When he had been stealing, the baboon often staid out of sight for some
hours; but, this time, he hid himself for several days.They searched
every where for him, but in vain, till his master feared he had really
deserted them.On the third day, one of the men, who had gone to a
distance for water, saw him hiding in a tree.Le Vaillant went out and
spoke to him, but he knew he had deserved punishment, and he would not
come down; so that, at last, his master had to go up the tree and take
him.""No; he was forgiven that time, as he seemed so penitent.There is only
one thing more I can remember about him.An officer who was visiting Le
Vaillant, wishing to try the affection of the baboon for his master,
pretended to strike him.Kees flew into a violent rage, and from that
time could never endure the sight of the officer.If he only saw him at
a distance, he ground his teeth, and used every endeavor to fly at him;
and had he not been chained, he would speedily have revenged the
insult."*       *       *       *       *

the study of the ordinary forms of poetry, of plot structure, and the
simpler problems of description.For this reason in the exercises that
follow the emphasis has been placed on these topics._The Lady of the Lake_ is an excellent example of the minor epic.Corresponding to the "Arms and the man I sing," of the AEneid, and the
invocation to the Muse, are the statement of the theme, "Knighthood's
dauntless deed and Beauty's matchless eye," and the invocation to the
Harp of the North, in the opening stanzas.For the heroes, descendants
of the gods, of the great epic, we have a king, the chieftain of a
great clan, an outlaw earl and his daughter, characters less elevated
than those of the great epic, but still important.The element of the
supernatural brought in by the gods and goddesses of the epic is here
supplied by the minstrel, Brian the priest, and the harp.The interest
of the poem lies in the incidents as with the epic.The romantic story
of Ellen and Malcolm, however, lies quite outside the realm of the
great epic, which is concerned with the fate of a state or body of
people rather than with that of an individual.There are two threads to the story, one concerned with the love story
of Ellen and Malcolm, the main plot; and one with Roderick and his clan
against the King, the minor plot.The connection between them is very
slight, the story of Ellen could have been told almost without the
other, but the struggle of the Clan makes a fine background for the
love story of Ellen and Malcolm.The plot is an excellent one for the
beginner to study as the structure is so evident.The following is a
simple outline of the main incidents of the story.The coming of the stranger, later supposed by Roderick to
      be a spy of the King.The return of Douglas, guided by Malcolm, an act which
      brings Malcolm under the displeasure of the King.Roderick's proposal for Ellen's hand in order to avert the
      danger threatening Ellen and Douglas because of the recognition
      of the latter by the King's men.The rejection of the proposal, leading to the withdrawal of
      Ellen and her father to Coir-Uriskin and the departure of
      Douglas to the court to save Roderick and Malcolm.The preparations for war made by Roderick, including the
      sending of the Fiery Cross, and the Taghairm.Ellen and Allan-Bane at Coir-Uriskin.Douglas on his way to give himself up.The triumph of Fitz-James over Roderick.The interest reawakened in the King by Douglas's prowess
      and generosity.The battle of Beal 'an Duine.All of Scott's works afford excellent models of description for the
beginner in this very difficult form of composition.He deals with
the problems of description in a simple and evident manner.In most
cases he begins his description with the point of view, and chooses
the details in accordance with that point of view.The principle of
order used in the arrangement of the details is usually easy to find
and follow, and the beauty of his contrasts, the vanity and vividness
of his diction can be in a measure appreciated even by boys and girls
in the first year of the high school.If properly taught a pupil must
leave the study of the poem with a new sense of the power of words.In his description of character Scott deals with the most simple and
elemental emotions and is therefore fairly easy to imitate.In the
special topics under each canto special emphasis has been laid upon
description because of the adaptability of _his_ description to the needs
of the student.SPECIAL STUDIES IN THE CANTOS.CANTO I.

TEACHERS' OUTLINES FOR STUDIES IN ENGLISH

Based on the Requirements for Admission to College

By GILBERT SYKES BLAKELY, A.M., Instructor in English in the Morris
High School, New York City.This little book is intended to present to teachers plans for the study
of the English texts required for admission to college.These Outlines
are full of inspiration and suggestion, and will be welcomed by every
live teacher who hitherto, in order to avoid ruts, has been obliged to
compare notes with other teachers, visit classes, and note methods.The volume aims not at a discussion of the principles of teaching, but
at an application of certain principles to the teaching of some of the
books most generally read in schools.¶ The references by page and line to the book under discussion are to
the texts of the Gateway Series; but the Outlines can be used with any
series of English classics.¶ Certain brief plans of study are developed for the general teaching
of the novel, narrative poetry, lyric poetry, the drama, and the
essay.The suggestions are those of a practical teacher, and follow a
definite scheme in each work to be studied.There are discussions of
methods, topics for compositions, and questions for review.The lists
of questions are by no means exhaustive, but those that are given are
suggestive and typical.¶ The appendix contains twenty examinations in English, for admission
to college, recently set by different colleges in both the East and the
West.AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY

HALLECK'S NEW ENGLISH LITERATURE

By REUBEN POST HALLECK, M. A., LL.D. author of History of English
Literature, and History of American Literature.This New English Literature preserves the qualities which have caused
the author's former History of English Literature to be so widely used;
namely, suggestiveness, clearness, organic unity, interest, and power
to awaken thought and to stimulate the student to further reading.¶ Here are presented the new facts which have recently been brought
to light, and the new points of view which have been adopted.More
attention is paid to recent writers.The present critical point of
view concerning authors, which has been brought about by the new
social spirit, is reflected.Many new and important facts concerning
the Elizabethan theater and the drama of Shakespeare's time are
incorporated.¶ Other special features are the unusually detailed Suggested Readings
that follow each chapter, suggestions and references for a literary
trip to England, historical introductions to the chapters, careful
treatment of the modern drama, and a new and up-to-date bibliography.¶ Over 200 pictures selected for their pedagogical value and their
unusual character appear in their appropriate places in connection with
the text.The frontispiece, in colors, shows the performance of an
Elizabethan play in the Fortune Theater.AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY

A HISTORY OF AMERICAN LITERATURE

By REUBEN POST HALLECK, M.A., Principal, Male High School, Louisville,
Ky.A companion volume to the author's History of English Literature.It describes the greatest achievements in American literature from
colonial times to the present, placing emphasis not only upon men,
but also upon literary movements, the causes of which are thoroughly
investigated.Further, the relation of each period of American
literature to the corresponding epoch of English literature has been
carefully brought out--and each period is illuminated by a brief survey
of its history.¶ The seven chapters of the book treat in succession of Colonial
Literature, The Emergence of a Nation (1754-1809), the New York Group,
The New England Group, Southern Literature, Western Literature, and
the Eastern Realists.To these are added a supplementary list of less
important authors and their chief works, as well as A Glance Backward,
which emphasizes in brief compass the most important truths taught by
American literature.¶ At the end of each chapter is a summary which helps to fix the
period in mind by briefly reviewing the most significant achievements.This is followed by extensive historical and literary references for
further study, by a very helpful list of suggested readings, and by
questions and suggestions, designed to stimulate the student's interest
and enthusiasm, and to lead him to study and investigate further for
himself the remarkable literary record of American aspiration and
accomplishment.AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY

Transcriber's Notes:

     Underscores "_" before and after a word or phrase indicate italics
       in the original text.The word "onomatopoeia" uses an "oe" ligature in the original.A few words use diacritical characters in the original.Behold the cause of all the well-feign'd virtue
 Of this mock patriot--curst dissimulation!_Pub._ And canst thou entertain such vile suspicions?now I see thee as thou art,
 Thy naked soul divested of its veil,
 Its specious colouring, its dissembled virtues:
 Thou hast plotted with the Senate to prevent
 Th' exchange of captives.All thy subtle arts,
 Thy smooth inventions, have been set to work--
 The base refinements of your _polish'd_ land._Pub._ In truth the doubt is worthy of an African.[_Contemptuously._

 _Ham._ I know.----

 _Pub._ Peace, Carthaginian, peace, and hear me,
 Dost thou not know, that on the very man
 Thou hast insulted, Barce's fate depends?_Ham._ Too well I know, the cruel chance of war
 Gave her, a blooming captive, to thy mother;
 Who, dying, left the beauteous prize to thee._Pub._ Now, see the use a _Roman_ makes of power.Heav'n is my witness how I lov'd the maid!Oh, she was dearer to my soul than light!Dear as the vital stream that feeds my heart!But know my _honour_'s dearer than my love.I do not even hope _thou_ wilt believe me;
 _Thy_ brutal soul, as savage as thy clime,
 Can never taste those elegant delights,
 Those pure refinements, love and glory yield.'Tis not to thee I stoop for vindication,
 Alike to me thy friendship or thy hate;
 But to remove from others a pretence
 For branding Publius with the name of villain;
 That _they_ may see no sentiment but honour
 Informs this bosom--Barce, thou art _free_.Thou hast my leave with him to quit this shore.Now learn, barbarian, how a _Roman_ loves![_Exit._

 _Barce._ He cannot mean it!_Ham._                         Oh, exalted virtue!cruel Publius, wilt thou leave me thus?_Barce._                Didst thou hear, Hamilcar?Oh, didst thou hear the god-like youth resign me?[HAMILCAR _and_ LICINIUS _seem lost in thought_._Ham._ Farewell, I will return._Barce._ Hamilcar, where----

 _At._                 Alas!_Lic._ If possible, to save the life of Regulus._At._ But by what means?--Ah!_Lic._ Since the disease so desperate is become,
 We must apply a desperate remedy._Ham._ (_after a long pause._)
 Yes--I will mortify this generous foe;
 I'll be reveng'd upon this stubborn Roman;
 Not by defiance bold, or feats of arms,
 But by a means more sure to work its end;
 By emulating his exalted worth,
 And showing him a virtue like his own;
 Such a refin'd revenge as noble minds
 Alone can practise, and alone can feel._At._ If thou wilt go, Licinius, let Attilia
 At least go with thee._Lic._                 No, my gentle love,
 Too much I prize thy safety and thy peace.Let me entreat thee, stay with Barce here
 Till our return._At._              Then, ere ye go, in pity
 Explain the latent purpose of your souls._Lic._ Soon shalt thou know it all--Farewell!Let us keep Regulus in _Rome_, or _die_.[_To_ HAMILCAR _as he goes out_._Ham._ Yes.--These smooth, polish'd Romans shall confess
 The soil of _Afric_, too, produces heroes.What, though our pride, perhaps, be less than theirs,
 Our virtue may be equal: they shall own
 The path of honour's not unknown to Carthage,
 Nor, as they arrogantly think, confin'd
 To their proud Capitol:----Yes--they shall learn
 The gods look down on other climes than theirs.[_Exit._

 _At._ What gone, _both_ gone?Licinius leaves me, led by love and virtue,
 To rouse the citizens to war and tumult,
 Which may be fatal to himself and Rome,
 And yet, alas!_Barce._ Nor is thy Barce more at ease, my friend;
 I dread the fierceness of Hamilcar's courage:
 Rous'd by the grandeur of thy brother's deed,
 And stung by his reproaches, his great soul
 Will scorn to be outdone by him in glory.Yet, let us rise to courage and to life,
 Forget the weakness of our helpless sex,
 And mount above these coward woman's fears.Hope dawns upon my mind--my prospect clears,
 And every cloud now brightens into day.Thy sanguine temper,
 Flush'd with the native vigour of thy soil,
 Supports thy spirits; while the sad Attilia,
 Sinking with more than all her sex's fears,
 Sees not a beam of hope; or, if she sees it,
 'Tis not the bright, warm splendour of the sun;
 It is a sickly and uncertain glimmer
 Of instantaneous lightning passing by.It shows, but not diminishes, the danger,
 And leaves my poor benighted soul as dark
 As it had never shone._Barce._                 Come, let us go.Yes, joys unlook'd-for now shall gild thy days,
 And brighter suns reflect propitious rays.[_Exeunt._


 SCENE--_A Hall looking towards the Garden._

 _Enter_ REGULUS, _speaking to one of_ HAMILCAR'S _Attendants_.Ere this he doubtless knows the Senate's will.Go, seek him out--Tell him we must depart----
 Rome has no hope for him, or wish for me.O let me strain thee to this grateful heart,
 And thank thee for the vast, vast debt I owe thee!But for _thy_ friendship I had been a wretch----
 Had been compell'd to shameful _liberty_.To thee I owe the glory of these chains,
 My faith inviolate, my fame preserv'd,
 My honour, virtue, glory, bondage,--all!_Man._ But we shall lose thee, so it is decreed----
 Thou must depart?_Reg._                Because I must depart
 You will not lose me; I were lost, indeed,
 Did I remain in Rome._Man._                   Ah!Regulus,
 Why, why so late do I begin to love thee?why have the adverse fates decreed
 I ne'er must give thee other proofs of friendship,
 Than those so fatal and so full of woe?_Reg._ Thou hast perform'd the duties of a friend;
 Of a just, faithful, Roman, noble friend:
 Yet, generous as thou art, if thou constrain me
 To sink beneath a weight of obligation,
 I could--yes, Manlius--I could ask still more._Reg._                   I think I have fulfill'd
 The various duties of a citizen;
 Nor have I aught beside to do for Rome.Manlius, I recollect I am a father!my friend,
 They are--(forgive the weakness of a parent)
 To my fond heart dear as the drops that warm it.Next to my country they're my all of life;
 And, if a weak old man be not deceiv'd,
 They will not shame that country.Yes, my friend,
 The love of virtue blazes in their souls.As yet these tender plants are immature,
 And ask the fostering hand of cultivation:
 Heav'n, in its wisdom, would not let their _father_
 Accomplish this great work.--To thee, my friend,
 The tender parent delegates the trust:
 Do not refuse a poor man's legacy;
 I do bequeath my orphans to thy love--
 If thou wilt kindly take them to thy bosom,
 Their loss will be repaid with usury.Oh, let the father owe his glory to thee,
 The children their protection!_Man._                           Regulus,
 With grateful joy my heart accepts the trust:
 Oh, I will shield, with jealous tenderness,
 The precious blossoms from a blasting world.In me thy children shall possess a father,
 Though not as worthy, yet as fond as thee.The pride be mine to fill their youthful breasts
 With ev'ry virtue--'twill not cost me much:
 I shall have nought to teach, nor they to learn,
 But the great history of their god-like sire._Reg._ I will not hurt the grandeur of thy virtue,
 By paying thee so poor a thing as thanks.Now all is over, and I bless the gods,
 I've nothing more to do._Enter_ PUBLIUS _in haste_._Pub._                    O Regulus!_Pub._                       Rome is in a tumult--
 There's scarce a citizen but runs to arms--
 They will not let thee go._Reg._                     Is't possible?Can Rome so far forget her dignity
 As to desire this infamous exchange?_Pub._               Ah!Rome cares not for the peace, nor for th' exchange;
 She only wills that Regulus shall stay._Pub._              No: every man exclaims
 That neither faith nor honour should be kept
 With Carthaginian perfidy and fraud.Can guilt in Carthage palliate guilt in Rome,
 Or vice in one absolve it in another?who hereafter shall be criminal,
 If precedents are us'd to justify
 The blackest crimes._Pub._                 Th' infatuated people
 Have called the augurs to the sacred fane,
 There to determine this momentous point._Reg._ I have no need of _oracles_, my son;
 _Honour's_ the oracle of honest men.I gave my promise, which I will observe
 With most religious strictness.Rome, 'tis true,
 Had power to choose the peace, or change of slaves;
 But whether Regulus return, or not,
 Is _his_ concern, not the concern of _Rome_._That_ was a public, _this_ a private care.thy father is not what he was;
 _I_ am the slave of _Carthage_, nor has Rome
 Power to dispose of captives not her own.let us to the port.--Farewell, my friend._Man._ Let me entreat thee stay; for shouldst thou go
 To stem this tumult of the populace,
 They will by force detain thee: then, alas!Both Regulus and Rome must break their faith._Man._                                No, Regulus,
 I will not check thy great career of glory:
 Thou shalt depart; meanwhile, I'll try to calm
 This wild tumultuous uproar of the people._Reg._ Thy virtue is my safeguard----but----

 _Man._                                Enough----
 _I_ know _thy_ honour, and trust thou to _mine_.I am a _Roman_, and I feel some sparks
 Of Regulus's virtue in my breast.Though fate denies me thy illustrious chains,
 I will at least endeavour to _deserve_ them.[_Exit._

 _Reg._ How is my country alter'd!how, alas,
 Is the great spirit of old Rome extinct!_Restraint_ and _force_ must now be put to use
 To _make_ her virtuous.She must be _compell'd_
 To faith and honour.--Ah!And dost thou leave so tamely to my friend
 The honour to assist me?Go, my boy,
 'Twill make me _more_ in love with chains and death,
 To owe them to a _son_._Pub._                    I go, my father--
 I will, I will obey thee._Reg._                    Do not sigh----
 One sigh will check the progress of thy glory._Pub._ Yes, I will own the pangs of death itself
 Would be less cruel than these agonies:
 Yet do not frown austerely on thy son:
 His anguish is his virtue: if to conquer
 The feelings of my soul were easy to me,
 'Twould be no merit.Do not then defraud
 The sacrifice I make thee of its worth.[_Exeunt severally._


    MANLIUS, ATTILIA._At._ (_speaking as she enters._)
 Where is the Consul?--Where, oh, where is Manlius?I come to breathe the voice of mourning to him,
 I come to crave his mercy, to conjure him
 To whisper peace to my afflicted bosom,
 And heal the anguish of a wounded spirit._Man._ What would the daughter of my noble friend?_At._ (_kneeling._)
 If ever pity's sweet emotions touch'd thee,--
 If ever gentle love assail'd thy breast,--
 If ever virtuous friendship fir'd thy soul--
 By the dear names of husband and of parent--
 By all the soft, yet powerful ties of nature--
 If e'er thy lisping infants charm'd thine ear,
 And waken'd all the father in thy soul,--
 If e'er thou hop'st to have thy latter days
 Blest by their love, and sweeten'd by their duty--
 Oh, hear a kneeling, weeping, wretched daughter,
 Who begs a father's life!--nor hers alone,
 But Rome's--his country's father._Man._                                Gentle maid!Oh, spare this soft, subduing eloquence!--
 Nay, rise.I shall forget I am a Roman--
 Forget the mighty debt I owe my country--
 Forget the fame and glory of thy father.[_Turns from her._

 _At._ (_rises eagerly._)            Ah!Indulge, indulge, my Lord, the virtuous softness:
 Was ever sight so graceful, so becoming,
 As pity's tear upon the hero's cheek?_Man._ No more--I must not hear thee.[_Going._

 _At._                    How!You must--you shall--nay, nay return, my Lord--
 Oh, fly not from me!----look upon my woes,
 And imitate the mercy of the gods:
 'Tis not their thunder that excites our reverence,
 'Tis their mild mercy, and forgiving love.'Twill add a brighter lustre to thy laurels,
 When men shall say, and proudly point thee out,
 "Behold the Consul!--He who sav'd his friend."Oh, what a tide of joy will overwhelm thee!_Man._ Thy father scorns his liberty and life,
 Nor will accept of either at the expense
 Of honour, virtue, glory, faith, and Rome._At._ Think you behold the god-like Regulus
 The prey of unrelenting savage foes,
 Ingenious only in contriving ill:----
 Eager to glut their hunger of revenge,
 They'll plot such new, such dire, unheard-of tortures--
 Such dreadful, and such complicated vengeance,
 As e'en the Punic annals have not known;
 And, as they heap fresh torments on his head,
 They'll glory in their genius for destruction.Manlius--now methinks I see my father--
 My faithful fancy, full of his idea,
 Presents him to me--mangled, gash'd, and torn--
 Stretch'd on the rack in writhing agony--
 The torturing pincers tear his quivering flesh,
 While the dire murderers smile upon his wounds,
 His groans their music, and his pangs their sport.And if they lend some interval of ease,
 Some dear-bought intermission, meant to make
 The following pang more exquisitely felt,
 Th' insulting executioners exclaim,
 --"Now, Roman!_Man._ Repress thy sorrows----

 _At._                     Can the friend of Regulus
 Advise his daughter not to mourn his fate?is friendship when compar'd
 To ties of blood--to nature's powerful impulse!Yes--she asserts her empire in my soul,
 'Tis Nature pleads--she will--she must be heard;
 With warm, resistless eloquence she pleads.--
 Ah, thou art soften'd!--see--the Consul yields--
 The feelings triumph--tenderness prevails--
 The Roman is subdued--the daughter conquers![_Catching hold of his robe._

 _Man._ Ah, hold me not!--I must not, cannot stay,
 The softness of thy sorrow is contagious;
 I, too, may feel when I should only reason.I dare not hear thee--Regulus and Rome,
 The patriot and the friend--all, all forbid it.[_Breaks from her, and exit._

 _At._ O feeble grasp!--and is he gone, quite gone?Hold, hold thy empire, Reason, firmly hold it,
 Or rather quit at once thy feeble throne,
 Since thou but serv'st to show me what I've lost,
 To heighten all the horrors that await me;
 To summon up a wild distracted crowd
 Of fatal images, to shake my soul,
 To scare sweet peace, and banish hope itself.thou pale-ey'd spectre, come,
 For thou shalt be Attilia's inmate now,
 And thou shalt grow, and twine about her heart,
 And she shall be so much enamour'd of thee,
 The pageant Pleasure ne'er shall interpose
 Her gaudy presence to divide you more.[_Stands in an attitude of silent grief._


    _Enter_ LICINIUS._Lic._ At length I've found thee--ah, my charming maid!How have I sought thee out with anxious fondness!she hears me not.----My best Attilia!Still, still she hears not----'tis Licinius speaks,
 He comes to soothe the anguish of thy spirit,
 And hush thy tender sorrows into peace._At._ Who's he that dares assume the voice of love,
 And comes unbidden to these dreary haunts?Steals on the sacred treasury of woe,
 And breaks the league Despair and I have made?_Lic._ 'Tis one who comes the messenger of heav'n,
 To talk of peace, of comfort, and of joy._At._ Didst thou not mock me with the sound of joy?Thou little know'st the anguish of my soul,
 If thou believ'st I ever can again,
 So long the wretched sport of angry Fortune,
 Admit delusive hope to my sad bosom.No----I abjure the flatterer and her train.Let those, who ne'er have been like me deceiv'd,
 Embrace the fair fantastic sycophant--
 For I, alas!am wedded to despair,
 And will not hear the sound of comfort more._Lic._ Cease, cease, my love, this tender voice of woe,
 Though softer than the dying cygnet's plaint:
 She ever chants her most melodious strain
 When death and sorrow harmonise her note._At._ Yes--I will listen now with fond delight;
 For death and sorrow are my darling themes.Well!--what hast thou to say of death and sorrow?Believe me, thou wilt find me apt to listen,
 And, if my tongue be slow to answer thee,
 Instead of words I'll give thee sighs and tears._Lic._ I come to dry thy tears, not make them flow;
 The gods once more propitious smile upon us,
 Joy shall again await each happy morn,
 And ever-new delight shall crown the day!Yes, Regulus shall live.----

 _At._                   Ah me!I'm but a poor, weak, trembling woman--
 I cannot bear these wild extremes of fate--
 Then mock me not.--I think thou art Licinius,
 The generous lover, and the faithful friend!I think thou wouldst not sport with my afflictions._Lic._ Mock thy afflictions?--May eternal Jove,
 And every power at whose dread shrine we worship,
 Blast all the hopes my fond ideas form,
 If I deceive thee!Regulus shall live,
 Shall live to give thee to Licinius' arms.we will smooth his downward path of life,
 And after a long length of virtuous years,
 At the last verge of honourable age,
 When nature's glimmering lamp goes gently out,
 We'll close, together close his eyes in peace--
 Together drop the sweetly-painful tear--
 Then copy out his virtues in our lives._At._ And shall we be so blest?Forgive me, my Licinius, if I doubt thee.Fate never gave such exquisite delight
 As flattering hope hath imag'd to thy soul.But how?----Explain this bounty of the gods._Lic._ Thou know'st what influence the name of Tribune
 Gives its possessor o'er the people's minds:
 That power I have exerted, nor in vain;
 All are prepar'd to second my designs:
 The plot is ripe,--there's not a man but swears
 To keep thy god-like father here in Rome----
 To save his life at hazard of his own._At._ By what gradation does my joy ascend!I thought that if my father had been sav'd
 By any means, I had been rich in bliss:
 But that he lives, and lives preserv'd by thee,
 Is such a prodigality of fate,
 I cannot bear my joy with moderation:
 Heav'n should have dealt it with a scantier hand,
 And not have shower'd such plenteous blessings on me;
 They are too great, too flattering to be real;
 'Tis some delightful vision, which enchants,
 And cheats my senses, weaken'd by misfortune._Lic._ We'll seek thy father, and meanwhile, my fair,
 Compose thy sweet emotions ere thou see'st him,
 Pleasure itself is painful in excess;
 For joys, like sorrows, in extreme, oppress:
 The gods themselves our pious cares approve,
 And to reward our virtue crown our love._An Apartment in the Ambassador's Palace--Guards
 and other Attendants seen at a distance._


 _Ham._ Where is this wondrous man, this matchless hero,
 This arbiter of kingdoms and of kings,
 This delegate of heav'n, this Roman god?I long to show his soaring mind an equal,
 And bring it to the standard of humanity.What pride, what glory will it be to fix
 An obligation on his stubborn soul!The very thought exalts me e'en to rapture._Enter_ REGULUS _and Guards_._Ham._ Well, Regulus!--At last--

 _Reg._                            I know it all;
 I know the motive of thy just complaint--
 Be not alarm'd at this licentious uproar
 Of the mad populace.I will depart--
 Fear not--I will not stay in Rome alive._Ham._ What dost thou mean by uproar and alarms?Hamilcar does not come to vent complaints;
 He rather comes to prove that Afric, too,
 Produces heroes, and that Tiber's banks
 May find a rival on the Punic coast._Reg._ Be it so.--'Tis not a time for vain debate:
 Collect thy people.--Let us strait depart._Ham._ Lend me thy hearing, first._Reg._                       O patience, patience!_Ham._ Is it esteem'd a glory to be grateful?_Reg._ The time has been when 'twas a duty only,
 But 'tis a duty now so little practis'd,
 That to perform it is become a glory._Ham._ If to fulfil it should expose to danger?----

 _Reg._ It rises then to an illustrious virtue._Ham._ Then grant this merit to an African.Give me a patient hearing----Thy great son,
 As delicate in honour as in love,
 Hath nobly given my Barce to my arms;
 And yet I know he doats upon the maid.I come to emulate the generous deed;
 He gave me back my love, and in return
 I will restore his father._Reg._                   Ah!_Ham._                       I will._Reg._                                But how?_Ham._ By leaving thee at liberty to _fly_._Reg._                                      Ah!_Ham._ I will dismiss my guards on some pretence,
 Meanwhile do thou escape, and lie conceal'd:
 I will affect a rage I shall not feel,
 Unmoor my ships, and sail for Africa._Reg._ Abhorr'd barbarian!_Ham._                   Well, what dost thou say?_Reg._                       I am, indeed._Ham._ Thou could'st not then have hop'd it?_Reg._                          No!_Ham._ And yet I'm not a Roman._Reg._ (_smiling contemptuously._) I perceive it._Ham._ You may retire (_aloud to the guards_)._Reg._             No!--Stay, I charge you stay._Reg._                  I thank thee for thy offer,
 But I shall go with thee._Ham._                   'Tis well, proud man!_Reg._                        No--but I pity thee._Reg._                   Because thy poor dark soul
 Hath never felt the piercing ray of virtue.the scheme thou dost propose
 Would injure me, thy country, and thyself._Reg._                   Who was it gave thee power
 To rule the destiny of Regulus?Am I a slave to Carthage, or to thee?_Ham._ What does it signify from whom, proud Roman!_Reg._                           A benefit?is it a benefit
 To lie, elope, deceive, and be a villain?not when life itself, when all's at stake?Know'st thou my countrymen prepare thee tortures
 That shock imagination but to think of?Thou wilt be mangled, butcher'd, rack'd, impal'd._Reg._ (_smiling at his threats._) Hamilcar!Dost thou not know the Roman genius better?We live on honour--'tis our food, our life.The motive, and the measure of our deeds!We look on death as on a common object;
 The tongue nor faulters, nor the cheek turns pale,
 Nor the calm eye is mov'd at sight of him:
 We court, and we embrace him undismay'd;
 We smile at tortures if they lead to glory,
 And only cowardice and guilt appal us.the valour of the tongue,
 The heart disclaims it; leave this pomp of words,
 And cease dissembling with a friend like me.I know that life is dear to all who live,
 That death is dreadful,--yes, and must be fear'd,
 E'en by the frozen apathists of Rome._Reg._ Did I fear death when on Bagrada's banks
 I fac'd and slew the formidable serpent
 That made your boldest Africans recoil,
 And shrink with horror, though the monster liv'd
 A native inmate of their own parch'd deserts?Did I fear death before the gates of Adis?--
 Ask Bostar, or let Asdrubal confess._Ham._ Or shall I rather of Xantippus ask,
 Who dar'd to undeceive deluded Rome,
 And prove this vaunter not invincible?'Tis even said, in Africa I mean,
 He made a prisoner of this demigod.--
 Did we not triumph then?_Reg._                     Vain boaster!No Carthaginian conquer'd Regulus;
 Xantippus was a Greek--a brave one too:
 Yet what distinction did your Afric make
 Between the man who serv'd her, and her foe:
 I was the object of her open hate;
 He, of her secret, dark malignity.He durst not trust the nation he had sav'd;
 He knew, and therefore fear'd you.--Yes, he knew
 Where once you were oblig'd you ne'er forgave.Could you forgive at all, you'd rather pardon
 The man who hated, than the man who serv'd you.Xantippus found his ruin ere it reach'd him,
 Lurking behind your honours and rewards;
 Found it in your feign'd courtesies and fawnings.When vice intends to strike a master stroke,
 Its veil is smiles, its language protestations.The Spartan's merit threaten'd, but his service
 Compell'd his ruin.--Both you could not pardon._Ham._ Come, come, I know full well----

 _Reg._                          Barbarian!I've heard too much.--Go, call thy followers:
 Prepare thy ships, and learn to do thy duty._Ham._ Yes!--show thyself intrepid, and insult me;
 Call mine the blindness of barbarian friendship.On Tiber's banks I hear thee, and am calm:
 But know, thou scornful Roman!that too soon
 In Carthage thou may'st fear and feel my vengeance:
 Thy cold, obdurate pride shall there confess,
 Though Rome may talk--'tis Africa can punish.[_Exit._

 _Reg._ Farewell!I've not a thought to waste on thee.I fear--but see Attilia comes!--

    _Enter_ ATTILIA._Reg._ What brings thee here, my child?_At._              I cannot speak--my father!Joy chokes my utterance--Rome, dear grateful Rome,
 (Oh, may her cup with blessings overflow!)Gives up our common destiny to thee;
 Faithful and constant to th' advice thou gav'st her,
 She will not hear of peace, or change of slaves,
 But she insists--reward and bless her, gods!--
 That thou shalt here remain._Reg._                   What!with the shame----

 _At._ Oh!no--the sacred senate hath consider'd
 That when to Carthage thou did'st pledge thy faith,
 Thou wast a captive, and that being such,
 Thou could'st not bind thyself in covenant._Reg._ He who can die, is always free, my child!Learn farther, he who owns another's strength
 Confesses his own weakness.--Let them know,
 I swore I would return because I chose it,
 And will return, because I swore to do it._Pub._ Vain is that hope, my father._Reg._                          Who shall stop me?_Pub._ All Rome.----The citizens are up in arms:
 In vain would reason stop the growing torrent;
 In vain wouldst thou attempt to reach the port,
 The way is barr'd by thronging multitudes:
 The other streets of Rome are all deserted._Reg._ Where, where is Manlius?_Pub._                       He is still thy friend:
 His single voice opposes a whole people;
 He threats this moment and the next entreats,
 But all in vain; none hear him, none obey.The general fury rises e'en to madness.The axes tremble in the lictors' hands,
 Who, pale and spiritless, want power to use them--
 And one wild scene of anarchy prevails.I tremble----
                              [_Detaining_ REGULUS._Reg._                        To assist my friend--
 T' upbraid my hapless country with her crime--
 To keep unstain'd the glory of these chains--
 To go, or perish._At._               Oh!_Reg._                                 Hold;
 I have been patient with thee; have indulg'd
 Too much the fond affections of thy soul;
 It is enough; thy grief would now offend
 Thy father's honour; do not let thy tears
 Conspire with Rome to rob me of my triumph._Reg._                             I know it does.I know 'twill grieve thy gentle heart to lose me;
 But think, thou mak'st the sacrifice to Rome,
 And all is well again._At._                   Alas!my father,
 In aught beside----

 _Reg._ What wouldst thou do, my child?Canst thou direct the destiny of Rome,
 And boldly plead amid the assembled senate?Canst thou, forgetting all thy sex's softness,
 Fiercely engage in hardy deeds of arms?Canst thou encounter labour, toil and famine,
 Fatigue and hardships, watchings, cold and heat?Canst thou attempt to serve thy country thus?Thou canst not:--but thou may'st sustain my loss
 Without these agonising pains of grief,
 And set a bright example of submission,
 Worthy a Roman's daughter._At._                         Yet such fortitude--

 _Reg._ Is a most painful virtue;--but Attilia
 Is Regulus's daughter, and must have it._At._ I will entreat the gods to give it me._Reg._ Is this concern a mark that thou hast lost it?I cannot, cannot spurn my weeping child.Receive this proof of my paternal fondness;--
 Thou lov'st Licinius--he too loves my daughter.I give thee to his wishes; I do more--
 I give thee to his virtues.--Yes, Attilia,
 The noble youth deserves this dearest pledge
 Thy father's friendship ever can bestow.wilt thou, canst thou leave me?_Reg._ I am, I am thy father!as a proof,
 I leave thee my example how to suffer.I have a heart within this bosom;
 That heart has passions--see in what we differ;
 Passion--which is thy tyrant--is my slave.Ah!--

 _Reg._                       Farewell![_Exit._

 _At._ Yes, Regulus!I feel thy spirit here,
 Thy mighty spirit struggling in this breast,
 And it shall conquer all these coward feelings,
 It shall subdue the woman in my soul;
 A Roman virgin should be something more--
 Should dare above her sex's narrow limits--
 And I will dare--and mis'ry shall assist me--
 My father!The hero shall no more disdain his child;
 Attilia shall not be the only branch
 That yields dishonour to the parent tree.is it true that Regulus,
 In spite of senate, people, augurs, friends,
 And children, will depart?_At._                       Yes, it is true._At._                                You forget--
 Barce!_Barce._ Dost thou approve a virtue which must lead
 To chains, to tortures, and to certain death?those chains, those tortures, and that death,
 Will be his triumph._Barce._                Thou art pleas'd, Attilia:
 By heav'n thou dost exult in his destruction![_Weeps._

 _Barce._                   I do not comprehend thee._At._ No, Barce, I believe it.--Why, how shouldst thou?If I mistake not, thou wast born in Carthage,
 In a barbarian land, where never child
 Was taught to triumph in a father's chains._Barce._ Yet thou dost weep--thy tears at least are honest,
 For they refuse to share thy tongue's deceit;
 They speak the genuine language of affliction,
 And tell the sorrows that oppress thy soul._At._ Grief, that dissolves in tears, relieves the heart.When congregated vapours melt in rain,
 The sky is calm'd, and all's serene again.[_Exit._

 _Barce._ Why, what a strange, fantastic land is this!This love of glory's the disease of Rome;
 It makes her mad, it is a wild delirium,
 An universal and contagious frenzy;
 It preys on all, it spares nor sex nor age:
 The Consul envies Regulus his chains--
 He, not less mad, contemns his life and freedom--
 The daughter glories in the father's ruin--
 And Publius, more distracted than the rest,
 Resigns the object that his soul adores,
 For this vain phantom, for this empty glory.This may be virtue; but I thank the gods,
 The soul of Barce's not a Roman soul.[_Exit._

 Would totter now beneath the armour's weight,
 The burden of that body it once shielded.You see, my friends, you see, my countrymen,
 I can no longer show myself a Roman,
 Except by dying like one.----Gracious Heaven

Hyphenation is inconsistent.In view of the Roman context, the word "virtus" was left in place in
a speech by Manlius in Act III, although it may be a misprint for
"virtue".It is always better for the breeder of any class of stock if the
animals he sells give satisfaction to the purchasers, and this is
particularly true of Shire horses.A doubtful breeder or one which is
not all that it should be may be fattened up and sold at more than its
market value, but the buyer would not be likely to go to the same man
if he wanted another horse, therefore it is better to gain a reputation
for honest dealing and to make every effort to keep it.It might be here mentioned that it is not at all satisfactory to rear
a Shire foal by itself, even if it will stay in its paddock.It never
thrives as well as when with company, and often stands with its head
down looking very mopish and dull, therefore the rearing of Shires is
not a suitable undertaking for a small holder, although he may keep
a good brood-mare to do most of his work and sell her foal at weaning
time.In the absence of a second foal a donkey is sometimes used as a
companion to a single one, but he is a somewhat unsatisfactory
playfellow, therefore the farmer with only one had far better sell it
straight from the teat, or if he has suitable accommodation he should
buy another to lie with it and rear the two together.Of course, two
will need more food than one, but no more journeys will be required to
carry it to the manger.Care should be taken, however, to buy one quite
as good, and if possible better, than the home-bred one.If they are to make geldings the colour should match, but if for
breeding purposes the colour need not necessarily be the same.Except
for making a working gelding, however, chestnuts should be avoided.It
is not a desirable colour to propagate, so one can breed enough of that
shade without buying one.A remark which may be also made with regard
to unsound ones, viz.that most horse-breeders get enough of them
without buying.During their second summer--that is as yearlings--Shires not wanted for
show purposes should be able to do themselves well at grass, supposing
the land is of average quality and not overstocked, but if the soil
is very poor it may be necessary to give a small feed once a day, of
which pulped mangolds may form a part if they are plentiful.This extra
feeding is better than stunting the growth, and the aim is to get a big
romping two-year-old colt, filly, or gelding as the case may be.Colts not up to the desired standard should be operated on during their
yearling days, preferably in May or June, and, as before indicated,
merit should be conspicuous in those left for stud purposes, while the
back breeding on both sides counts for much in a stallion.That is why
Lockinge Forest King, Childwick Champion, and a few others which could
be named, proved to be such prepotent stock-getters.After June or July colts should be separated from fillies unless the
colts have been castrated, and they must be put inside good fences,
this being something of a puzzle to a farmer with a few paddocks and
poor fences.Consequently, a second or third-rate young stallion often
causes a good deal of trouble, in fact, more than he leaves a return
for.For the second winter the young Shires still need a bit of help.If
they are to make, or are likely to make, anything out of the common
they should be fed liberally, otherwise a feed of chaff and corn once a
day will do, with a bit of hay to munch at night, but it must be good
wholesome forage.During their second spring, or when two years old, they should be put
to work as described in a former chapter, after which they are able at
least to earn their keep; the cost of rearing on the lines indicated up
to this age will be found to be considerable, so that a good saleable
animal is needed to make the business a profitable one; but I have kept
the rearing of good sound Shires in view, not crocks or mongrels.The effect of the war on the cost of feeding horses has led the Board
of Agriculture and Fisheries to issue a leaflet telling horse owners
of substitutes for oats.When it was written beans were relatively
cheaper, so was maize, while rice-meal was recommended to form part of
the mixture, owing to its lower cost.Those who have fed horses are aware that they do not like any food
which is of a dusty nature.It sticks in their nostrils, causing them
annoyance, if not discomfort, which a horse indicates by blowing its
nose frequently.Any kind of light meal should therefore be fed either with damp chaff
or with pulped roots, well mixed with the feed in the manner described
elsewhere.If mangolds have to be purchased at £1 per ton, they help to
make the meals more palatable.The farmer who grows a variety of corn
and roots is usually able to prepare and blend his own foods so as to
make a diet on which horses will thrive although oats are scarce.In Scotland boiled swedes or turnips are largely used for farm horses,
but coal and labour are now scarce as well as horse corn.CHAPTER VII

CARE OF THE FEET


There is no part of a Shire to which more attention should be paid
than the feet, and it is safe to say that the foot of the present-day
cart-horse is infinitely better than were those of his ancestors of
forty, or even twenty, years ago.The shape as well as the size has
been improved till the donkey-shaped hoof is rarely met with, at least
in show animals of this breed.It is always advisable to keep the feet of foals, yearlings, and
two-year-olds attended to whether they are required for show or not,
and if they have their feet quietly picked up and the edges rasped, the
heels being lowered a little when necessary, the hoof is prevented from
breaking, and a better and more durable hoof well repays the trouble,
moreover the task of fixing the first set of shoes--which used to be
quite a tough job for the smith when the colts were neglected till
they were three years old--is rendered quite easy.Except for travelling on the road, or when required for show, there is
no advantage in keeping shoes on young Shires, therefore they should be
taken off when lying idle, or if worked only on soft ground shoes are
not actually necessary.Where several are lying together, or even two, those with shoes on may
cause ugly wounds on their fellows, whereas a kick with the naked hoof
is not often serious.There is also a possibility that colts turned
away to grass with their shoes on will have the removing neglected, and
thus get corns, so that the shoeless hoof is always better for young
Shires so long as it is sound and normal.If not, of course, it should
be treated accordingly.In a dry summer, when the ground is very hard, it may be advisable
to use tips so that the foot may be preserved, this being especially
necessary in the case of thin and brittle hoofs.For growing and preserving good strong feet in Shire horses clay land
seems to answer best, seeing that those reared on heavy-land farms
almost invariably possess tough horn on which a shoe can be affixed to
last till it wears out.For the purpose of improving weak feet in young Shires turning them out
in cool clay land may be recommended, taking care to assist the growth
by keeping the heels open so that the frog comes into contact with the
ground.Weakness in the feet has been regarded, and rightly so, as a bad fault
in a Shire stallion, therefore good judges have always been particular
to put bottoms first when judging.Horses of all kinds have to travel,
which they cannot do satisfactorily for any length of time if their
feet are ill-formed or diseased, and it should be borne in mind that
a good or a bad foot can be inherited.“No foot, no horse,” is an old
and true belief.During the past few years farmers have certainly paid
more attention to the feet of their young stock because more of them
are shown, the remarks of judges and critics having taught them that
a good top cannot atone for poor bottoms, seeing that Shires are not
like stationary engines, made to do their work standing.They have to
spend a good part of their lives on hard roads or paved streets, where
contracted or tender feet quickly come to grief, therefore those who
want to produce saleable Shires should select parents with the approved
type of pedals, and see that those of the offspring do not go wrong
through neglect or mismanagement.There is no doubt that a set of good feet often places an otherwise
moderate Shire above one which has other good points but lacks this
essential; therefore all breeders of Shires should devote time and
attention to the production of sound and saleable bottoms, remembering
the oft-quoted line, “The top may come, the bottom never.” In diseases
of the feet it is those in front which are the most certain to go
wrong, and it is these which judges and buyers notice more particularly.If fever manifests itself it is generally in the fore feet; while
side-bone, ring-bone, and the like are incidental to the front coronets.Clay land has been spoken of for rearing Shires, but there are various
kinds of soil in England, all of which can be utilized as a breeding
ground for the Old English type of cart-horses.In Warwickshire Shires are bred on free-working red land, in Herts a
chalky soil prevails, yet champions abound there; while very light
sandy farms are capable of producing high-class Shires if the farmer
thereof sets his mind on getting them, and makes up for the poorness or
unsuitability of the soil by judicious feeding and careful management.It may be here stated that an arable farm can be made to produce a
good deal more horse forage than one composed wholly of pasture-land,
therefore more horses can be kept on the former.Heavy crops of clovers, mixtures, lucerne, etc., can be grown and mown
twice in the season, whereas grass can only be cut once.Oats and
oat straw are necessary, or at least desirable, for the rearing of
horses, so are carrots, golden tankard, mangold, etc; consequently an
arable-land farmer may certainly be a Shire horse breeder.This is getting away from the subject of feet, however, and it may be
returned to by saying that stable management counts for a good deal in
the growth and maintenance of a sound and healthy hoof.Good floors kept clean, dry litter, a diet in which roots appear,
moving shoes at regular intervals, fitting them to the feet, and not
rasping the hoof down to fit a too narrow shoe, may be mentioned as
aids in retaining good feet.As stated, the improvement in this particular has been very noticeable
since the writer’s first Shire Horse Show (in 1890), but perfection
has not yet been reached, therefore it remains for the breeders of the
present and the future to strive after it.There was a time when exhibitors of “Agricultural” horses stopped the
cracks and crevices in their horses’ feet with something in the nature
of putty, which is proved by reading a report of the Leeds Royal of
1861, where “the judges discovered the feet of one of the heavy horses
to be stopped with gutta-percha and pitch.”




CHAPTER VIII

HOW TO SHOW A SHIRE


A few remarks on the above subject will not come amiss, at least to
the uninitiated, for it is tolerably certain that, other things being
equal, the candidate for honours which makes the best show when it is
actually before the judges stands the first chance of securing the
honours.It must not be expected that a colt can be fetched out of a grass field
one day and trained well enough to show himself off creditably in the
ring the next; and a rough raw colt makes both itself and its groom
look small.Training properly takes time and patience, and it is best
to begin early with the process, from birth for choice.The lessons
need not, and certainly should not, be either long or severe at the
outset, but just enough to teach the youngster what is required of him.When teaching horses to stand at “attention” they should not be made to
stretch themselves out as if they were wanted to reach from one side
of the ring to the other, neither should they be allowed to stand like
an elephant on a tub.They should be taught to stand squarely on all
fours in a becoming and businesslike way.The best place for the groom
when a horse is wanted to stand still is exactly in front and facing
the animal.The rein is usually gripped about a foot from the head.Mares can often be allowed a little more “head,” but with stallions
it may be better to take hold close to the bit, always remembering to
have the loop end of the rein in the palm, in case he suddenly rears
or plunges.The leader should “go with his horse,” or keep step with
him, but need not “pick up” in such a manner as to make it appear to
bystanders that he is trying to make up for the shortcomings of his
horse.Both horse and man want to practise the performance in the home paddock
a good many times before perfection can be reached, and certainly
a little time thus spent is better than making a bad show when the
critical moment arrives that they are both called out to exhibit
themselves before a crowd of critics.If well trained the horse will respond to the call of the judges with
only a word, and no whip or stick need be used to get it through the
required walks and trots, or back to its place in the rank.There is a class of men who would profit by giving a little time to
training young horse stock, and that is the farmers who breed but do
not show.Of course, “professional show-men” (as they are sometimes
called) prefer to “buy their gems in the rough,” and put on the polish
themselves, and then take the profits for so doing.But why should not
the breeder make his animals show to their very best, and so get a
better price into his own pocket?Finally, I would respectfully suggest that if some of the horse show
societies were to have a horse-showing competition, _i.e._ give prizes
to the men who showed out a horse in the best manner, it would be both
interesting and instructive to horse lovers.CHAPTER IX

ORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF THE SHIRE


It is evident that a breed of comparatively heavy horses existed in
Britain at the time of the Roman Invasion, when Queen Boadicea’s
warriors met Cæsar’s fighting men (who were on foot) in war chariots
drawn by active but powerful horses, remarkable--as Sir Walter Gilbey’s
book on “The Great Horse” says--for “strength, substance, courage and
docility.”

These characteristics have been retained and improved upon all down the
ages since.The chariot with its knives, or blades, to mow down the
enemy was superseded by regiments of cavalry, the animals ridden being
the Old English type of War Horse.In those days it was the lighter or
second-rate animals, what we may call “the culls,” which were left for
agricultural purposes.The English knight, when clad in armour, weighed
something like 4 cwt., therefore a weedy animal would have sunk under
such a burden.This evidently forced the early breeders to avoid long backs by
breeding from strong-loined, deep-ribbed and well coupled animals,
seeing that slackness meant weakness and, therefore, worthlessness for
war purposes.It is easy to understand that a long-backed, light-middled mount with
a weight of 4 cwt.on his back would simply double up when stopped
suddenly by the rider to swing his battle axe at the head of his
antagonist, so we find from pictures and plates that the War Horse of
those far-off days was wide and muscular in his build, very full in his
thighs, while the saddle in use reached almost from the withers to the
hips, thus proving that the back was short.There came a time, however, when speed and mobility were preferred to
mere weight.The knight cast away his armour and selected a lighter and
fleeter mount than the War Horse of the ancient Britons.The change was, perhaps, began at the battle of Bannockburn in 1314.It is recorded that Robert Bruce rode a “palfrey” in that battle, on
which he dodged the charges of the ponderous English knights, and
he took a very heavy toll, not only of English warriors but of their
massive horses; therefore it is not unreasonable to suppose that some
of the latter were used for breeding purposes, and thus helped to build
up the Scottish, or Clydesdale, breed of heavy horses; but what was
England’s loss became Scotland’s gain, in that the Clydesdale breed had
a class devoted to it at the Highland Society’s Show in 1823, whereas
his English relative, “the Shire,” did not receive recognition by the
Royal Agricultural Society of England till 1883, sixty years later.As
a War Horse the British breed known as “The Great Horse” seems to have
been at its best between the Norman Conquest, 1066, and the date of
Bannockburn above-mentioned, owing to the fact that the Norman nobles,
who came over with William the Conqueror, fought on horseback, whereas
the Britons of old used to dismount out of their chariots, and fight on
foot.The Battle of Hastings was waged between Harold’s English Army of
infantry-men and William the Conqueror’s Army of horsemen, ending in a
victory for the latter.The Flemish horses thus became known to English horse breeders, and
they were certainly used to help lay the foundation of the Old English
breed of cart horses.It is clear that horses with substance were used for drawing chariots
at the Roman invasion in the year 55 B.C., but no great development
in horse-breeding took place in England till the Normans proved that
warriors could fight more effectively on horseback than on foot.After
this the noblemen of England appear to have set store by their horses,
consequently the twelfth and thirteenth centuries may be regarded
as the age in which Britain’s breed of heavy horses became firmly
established.In Sir Walter Gilbey’s book is a quotation showing that “Cart Horses
fit for the dray, the plough, or the chariot” were on sale at
Smithfield (London) every Friday, the extract being made from a book
written about 1154, and from the same source we learn that during the
reign of King John, 1199-1216, a hundred stallions “of large stature”
were imported from the low countries--Flanders and Holland.Passing from this large importation to the time of the famous Robert
Bakewell of Dishley (1726-1795), we find that he too went to Flanders
for stock to improve his cart horses, but instead of returning
with stallions he bought mares, which he mated with his stallions,
these being of the old black breed peculiar--in those days--to
Leicestershire.There is no doubt that the interest taken by this great
breed improver in the Old English type of cart horse had an effect far
more important than it did in the case of the Longhorn breed of cattle,
seeing that this has long lost its popularity, whereas that of the
Shire horse has been growing and widening from that day to this.Bakewell was the first English stockbreeder to let his stud animals for
the season, and although his greatest success was achieved with the
Dishley or “New Leicester” sheep, he also carried on the system with
Longhorn bulls and his cart horses, which were described as “Bakewell’s
Blacks.”

That his horses had a reputation is proved by the fact that in 1785
he had the honour of exhibiting a black horse before King George III.James’s Palace, but another horse named “K,” said by Marshall
to have died in that same year, 1785, at the age of nineteen years,
was described by the writer just quoted as a better animal than that
inspected by His Majesty the King.From the description given he
appears to have had a commanding forehand and to have carried his head
so high that his ears stood perpendicularly over his fore feet, as
Bakewell held that the head of a cart horse should.It can hardly be
questioned that he was a believer in weight, seeing that his horses
were “thick and short in body, on very short legs.”

The highest price he is credited with getting for the hire of a
stallion for a season is 150 guineas, while the service fee at home is
said to have been five guineas, which looks a small amount compared
with the 800 guineas obtained for the use of his ram “Two Pounder” for
a season.What is of more importance to Shire horse breeders, however, is the
fact that Robert Bakewell not only improved and popularized the Shire
horse of his day, but he instituted the system of letting out sires
for the season, which has been the means of placing good sires before
farmers, thus enabling them to assist in the improvement which has made
such strides since the formation of the Shire Horse Society in 1878.It is worth while to note that Bakewell’s horses were said to be
“perfectly gentle, willing workers, and of great power.” He held that
bad pullers were made so by bad management.He used two in front of
a Rotherham plough, the quantity ploughed being “four acres a day.”
Surely a splendid advertisement for the Shire as a plough horse.FLEMISH BLOOD

In view of the fact that Flanders has been very much in the public eye
for the past few months owing to its having been converted into a vast
battlefield, it is interesting to remember that we English farmers of
to-day owe at least something of the size, substance and soundness of
our Shire horses to the Flemish horse breeders of bygone days.Bakewell
is known to have obtained marvellous results among his cattle and sheep
by means of in-breeding, therefore we may assume that he would not have
gone to the Continent for an outcross for his horses unless he regarded
such a step beneficial to the breed.It is recorded by George Culley that a certain Earl of Huntingdon had
returned from the Low Countries--where he had been Ambassador--with a
set of black coach horses, mostly stallions.These were used by the
Trentside farmers, and without a doubt so impressed Bakewell as to
induce him to pay a visit to the country whence they came.If we turn from the history of the Shire to that of the Clydesdale it
will be found that the imported Flemish stallions are credited by the
most eminent authorities, with adding size to the North British breed
of draught horses.The Dukes of Hamilton were conspicuous for their interest in horse
breeding.One was said to have imported six black Flemish stallions--to
cross with the native mares--towards the close of the seventeenth
century, while the sixth duke, who died in 1758, imported one, which he
named “Clyde.”

This is notable, because it proves that both the English and Scotch
breeds have obtained size from the very country now devastated by war.It may be here mentioned that one of the greatest lovers and breeders
of heavy horses during the nineteenth century was schooled on the Duke
of Hamilton’s estate, and he was eminently successful in blending the
Shire and Clydesdale breeds to produce prizewinners and sires which
have done much towards building up the modern Clydesdale.Lawrence Drew, of Merryton, who, like Mr.Robert Bakewell,
had the distinction of exhibiting a stallion (named Prince of Wales)
before Royalty.Drew) bought many Shires in the Midland
Counties of England.So keen was his judgment that he would “spot a
winner” from a railway carriage, and has been known to alight at the
next station and make the journey back to the farm where he saw the
likely animal.On at least one occasion the farmer would not sell the best by itself,
so the enthusiast bought the whole team, which he had seen at plough
from the carriage window on the railway.Quite the most celebrated Shire stallion purchased by Mr.Drew in
England was Lincolnshire Lad 1196, who died in his possession in 1878.This horse won several prizes in Derbyshire before going north, and he
also begot Lincolnshire Lad II.1365, the sire of Harold 3703, Champion
of the London Show of 1887, who in turn begot Rokeby Harold (Champion
in London as a yearling, a three-year-old and a four-year-old),
Markeaton Royal Harold, the Champion of 1897, and of Queen of the
Shires, the Champion mare of the same year, 1897, and numerous other
celebrities.Drew in Derbyshire, was Flora,
by Lincolnshire Lad, who became the dam of Pandora, a great winner, and
the dam of Prince of Clay, Handsome Prince, and Pandora’s Prince, all
of which were Clydesdale stallions and stock-getters of the first rank.There is evidence to show that heavy horses from other countries than
Flanders were imported, but this much is perfectly clear, that the
Flemish breed was selected to impart size, therefore, if we give honour
where it is due, these “big and handsome” black stallions that we read
of deserve credit for helping to build up the breed of draught horses
in Britain, which is universally known as the Shire, its distinguishing
feature being that it is the heaviest breed in existence.CHAPTER X

FACTS AND FIGURES


The London Show of 1890 was a remarkable one in more than one sense.The entries totalled 646 against 447 the previous year.This led to the
adoption of measures to prevent exhibitors from making more than two
entries in one class.The year 1889 holds the record, so far, for the
number of export certificates granted by the Shire Horse Society, the
total being 1264 against 346 in 1913, yet Shires were much dearer in
the latter year than in the former.Twenty-five years ago the number of three-year-old stallions shown in
London was 161, while two-year-olds totalled 134, hence the rule of
charging double fees for more than two entries from one exhibitor.Another innovation was the passing of a rule that every animal entered
for show should be passed by a veterinary surgeon, this being the form
of certificate drawn up:--

    “I hereby certify that ________ entered by Mr.________ for
    exhibition at the Shire Horse Society’s London Show, 1891,
    has been examined by me and, in my opinion, is free from the
    following hereditary diseases, viz: Roaring (whistling),
    Ringbone, Unsound Feet, Navicular Disease, Spavin, Cataract,
    Sidebone, Shivering.”

These alterations led to a smaller show in 1891 (which was the first at
which the writer had the honour of leading round a candidate, exhibited
by a gentleman who subsequently bred several London winners, and who
served on the Council of the Shire Horse Society).But to hark back to
the 1890 Show.A. B. Freeman-Mitford’s
(now Lord Redesdale) Hitchin Conqueror, one of whose sons, I’m the
Sort the Second, made £1000 at the show after winning third prize; the
second-prize colt in the same class being sold for £700.The Champion mare was Starlight, then owned by Mr.R. N.
Sutton-Nelthorpe, but sold before the 1891 Show, at the Scawby sale,
for 925 guineas to Mr.John moved to the garden.Fred Crisp--who held a prominent place in the
Shire Horse world for several years.Starlight rewarded him by winning
Champion prize both in 1891 and 1892, her three successive victories
being a record in championships for females at the London Show.Others
have won highest honours thrice, but, so far, not in successive years.In 1890 the number of members of the Shire Horse Society was 1615, the
amount given in prizes being just over £700.A curious thing about that
1890 meeting, with its great entry, was that it resulted in a loss of
£1300 to the Society, but in those days farmers did not attend in their
thousands as they do now.The sum spent in 1914 was £2230, the number of members being 4200, and
the entries totalling 719, a similar sum being offered, at the time
this is being written, for distribution at the Shire Horse Show of
1915, which will be held when this country has, with the help of her
Allies, waged a great war for seven months, yet before it had been
carried on for seven days show committees in various parts of the
country cancelled their shows, being evidently under the impression
that “all was in the dust.” With horses of all grades at a premium, any
method of directing the attention of farmers and breeders generally
to the scarcity that is certain to exist is justifiable, particularly
that which provides for over two thousand pounds being spent among
members of what is admitted to be the most flourishing breed society in
existence.At the London Show of 1895 two classes for geldings were added to
the prize schedule, making fifteen in all, but even with twenty-two
geldings the total was only 489, so that it was a small show, its most
notable feature being that Mr.A. B. Freeman-Mitford’s Minnehaha won
the Challenge Cup for mares and died later.Up till the Show of 1898 both stallions and mares commenced with the
eldest, so that Class I was for stallions ten years old and upwards,
the yearlings coming last, the mare classes following in like order.But for the 1898 Show a desirable change was made by putting the
yearlings first, and following on with classes in the order of age.At
this show, 1898, Sir Alexander Henderson performed the unique feat of
winning not only the male and female Challenge Cups, but also the other
two, so that he had four cup winners, three of them being sire, dam,
and son, viz.Markeaton Royal Harold, Aurea, and Buscot Harold, this
made the victory particularly noteworthy.The last named also succeeded
in winning champion honours in 1899 and 1900, thus rivalling Starlight.The cup-winning gelding, Bardon Extraordinary, had won similar honours
the previous year for Mr.W. T. Everard, his owner in 1898 being Mr.He possessed both weight and quality, and it is doubtful
if a better gelding has been exhibited since.He was also cup winner
again in 1899, consequently he holds the record for geldings at the
London Show.It should have been mentioned that the system of giving breeders prizes
was introduced at the Show of 1896, the first prizes being reduced
from £25 to £20 in the case of stallions, and from £20 to £15 in those
for mares, to allow the breeder of the first prize animal £10 in each
breeding class, and the breeder of each second-prize stallion or mare
£5, the latter sum being awarded to breeders of first-prize geldings.This was a move in the right direction, and certainly gave the Shire
Horse Society and its London Show a lift up in the eyes of farmers
who had bred Shires but had not exhibited.Since then they have never
lost their claim on any good animal they have bred, that is why they
flock to the Show in February from all parts of England, and follow the
judging with such keen interest; there is money in it.This Show of 1896 was, therefore, one of the most important ever held.It marked the beginning of a more democratic era in the history of the
Great Horse.The sum of £1142 was well spent.By the year 1900 the prize money had reached a total of £1322, the
classes remaining as from 1895 with seven for stallions, six for
mares, and two for geldings.The next year, 1901, another class, for
mares 16 hands 2 inches and over, was added, and also another class
for geldings, resulting in a further rise to £1537 in prize money.The sensation of this Show was the winning of the Championship by new
tenant-farmer exhibitors, Messrs.J. and M. Walwyn, with an unknown
two-year-old colt, Bearwardcote Blaze.This was a bigger surprise than
the success of Rokeby Harold as a yearling in 1893, as he had won
prizes for his breeder, Mr.A. C. Rogers, and for Mr.John Parnell
(at Ashbourne) before getting into Lord Belper’s possession, therefore
great things were expected of him, whereas the colt Bearwardcote Blaze
was a veritable “dark horse.” Captain Heaton, of Worsley, was one of
the judges, and subsequently purchased him for Lord Ellesmere.The winning of the Championship by a yearling colt was much commented
on at the time (1893), but he was altogether an extraordinary colt.The
critics of that day regarded him as the best yearling Shire ever seen.Said one, “We breed Shire horses every day, but a colt like this comes
only once in a lifetime.” Fortunately I saw him both in London and at
the Chester Royal, where he was also Champion, my interest being all
the greater because he was bred in Bucks, close to where I “sung my
first song.”

Of two-year-old champions there have been at least four, viz.Prince
William, in 1885; Buscot Harold, 1898; Bearwardcote Blaze, 1901; and
Champion’s Goalkeeper, 1913.Three-year-olds have also won supreme honours fairly often.Those
within the writer’s recollection being Bury Victor Chief, in 1892,
after being first in his class for the two previous years, and reserve
champion in 1891; Rokeby Harold in 1895, who was Champion in 1893,
and cup winner in 1894; Buscot Harold, in 1899, thus repeating his
two-year-old performance; Halstead Royal Duke in 1909, the Royal
Champion as a two-year-old.The 1909 Show was remarkable for the successes of Lord Rothschild, who
after winning one of the championships for the previous six years, now
took both of the Challenge Cups, the reserve championship, and the Cup
for the best old stallion.The next and last three-year-old to win was, or is, the renowned
Champion’s Goalkeeper, who took the Challenge Cup in 1914 for the
second time.When comparing the ages of the male and female champions of the London
Show, it is seen that while the former often reach the pinnacle of
fame in their youth, the latter rarely do till they have had time to
develop.CHAPTER XI

HIGH PRICES


It is not possible to give particulars of sums paid for many animals
sold privately, as the amount is often kept secret, but a few may be
mentioned.The first purchase to attract great attention was that of
Prince William, by the late Lord Wantage from Mr.John Rowell in 1885
for £1500, or guineas, although Sir Walter Gilbey had before that given
a real good price to Mr.W. R. Rowland for the Bucks-bred Spark.The
next sensational private sale was that of Bury Victor Chief, the Royal
Champion of 1891, to Mr.Joseph Wainwright, the seller again being
Mr.John Rowell and the price 2500 guineas.In that same year, 1891,
Chancellor, one of Premier’s noted sons, made 1100 guineas at Mr.A.
C. Duncombe’s sale at Calwich, when eighteen of Premier’s sons and
daughters were paraded with their sire, and made an average, including
foals, of £273 each.In 1892 a record in letting was set up by the Welshpool Shire Horse
Society, who gave Lord Ellesmere £1000 for the use of Vulcan (the
champion of the 1891 London Show) to serve 100 mares.This society
was said to be composed of “shrewd tenant farmers who expected a good
return for their money.” Since then a thousand pounds for a first-class
sire has been paid many times, and it is in districts where they have
been used that those in search of the best go for their foals.Two
notable instances can be mentioned, viz.Champion’s Goalkeeper and
Lorna Doone, the male and female champions of the London Show of 1914,
which were both bred in the Welshpool district.Other high-priced
stallions to be sold by auction in the nineties were Marmion to Mr.Arkwright in 1892 for 1400 guineas, Waresley
Premier Duke to Mr.Victor Cavendish (now the Duke of Devonshire) for
1100 guineas at Mr.W. H. O. Duncombe’s sale in 1897, and a similar sum
by the same buyer for Lord Llangattock’s Hendre Crown Prince in the
same year.For the next really high-priced stallion we must come to the dispersion
of the late Lord Egerton’s stud in April, 1909, when Messrs.W. and H.
Whitley purchased the five-year-old Tatton Dray King (London Champion
in 1908) for 3700 guineas, to join their celebrated Devonshire stud.At this sale Tatton Herald, a two-year-old colt, made 1200 guineas to
Messrs.Ainscough, who won the championship with him at the Liverpool
Royal in 1910, but at the Royal Show of 1914 he figured, and won, as a
gelding.As a general rule, however, these costly sires have proved well worth
their money.As mentioned previously, the year 1913 will be remembered by the
fact that 4100 guineas was given at Lord Rothschild’s sale for the
two-year-old Shire colt Champion’s Goalkeeper, by Childwick Champion,
who, like Tatton Dray King and others, is likely to prove a good
investment at his cost.Twice since then he has championed the London
Show, and by the time these lines are read he may have accomplished
that great feat for the third time, his age being four years old in
1915.Of mares, Starlight, previously mentioned, was the first to approach a
thousand pounds in an auction sale.At the Shire Horse Show of 1893 the late Mr.Philo Mills exhibited
Moonlight, a mare which he had purchased privately for £1000, but she
only succeeded in getting a commended card, so good was the company in
which she found herself.The first Shire mare to make over a thousand
guineas at a stud sale was Dunsmore Gloaming, by Harold.This was at
the second Dunsmore Sale early in 1894, the price being 1010 guineas,
and the purchaser Mr.W. J. Buckley, Penyfai, Carmarthen, from whom
she was repurchased by the late Sir P. Albert Muntz, and was again
included in the Dunsmore catalogue of January 27, 1898, when she
realized 780 guineas, Sir J. Blundell Maple being the lucky purchaser,
the word being used because she won the challenge cup in London, both
in 1899 and 1900.Foaled in 1890 at Sandringham, by Harold (London
Champion), dam by Staunton Hero (London Champion), she was sold at
King Edward’s first sale in 1892 for 200 guineas.As a three- and
a four-year-old she was second in London, and she also won second
prize as a seven-year-old for Sir P. A. Muntz, finally winning supreme
honours at nine and ten years of age, a very successful finish to a
distinguished career.On February 11th, 1898, another record was set by
His Majesty King Edward VII., whose three-year-old filly Sea Breeze, by
the same sire as Bearwardcote Blaze, made 1150 guineas, Sir J. Blundell
Maple again being the buyer.The next mare to make four figures at a
stud sale was Hendre Crown Princess at the Lockinge sale of February
14, 1900, the successful bidder being Mr.H. H. Smith-Carington,
Ashby Folville, Melton Mowbray, who has bought and bred many good
Shires.This date, February 14, seems to
be a particularly lucky one for Shire sales, for besides the one just
mentioned Lord Rothschild has held at least two sales on February 14.In 1908 the yearling colt King Cole VII.was bought by the late Lord
Winterstoke for 900 guineas, the highest price realized by the stud
sales of that year.Then there is the record sale at Tring Park on
February 14, 1913, when one stallion, Champions Goalkeeper, made 4100
guineas, and another, Blacklands Kingmaker, 1750.The honour for being the highest priced Shire mare sold at a stud sale
belongs to the great show mare, Pailton Sorais, for which Sir Arthur
Nicholson gave 1200 guineas at the dispersion sale of Mr.Max Michaelis
at Tandridge, Surrey, on October 26, 1911.It will be remembered by
Shire breeders that she made a successful appearance in London each
year from one to eight years old, her list being: First, as a yearling;
sixth, as a two-year-old; second, as a three-year-old; first and
reserve champion at four years old, five and seven; first in her class
at six.She was not to be denied the absolute championship, however,
and it fell to her in 1911.No Shire in history has achieved greater
distinction than this, not even Honest Tom 1105, who won first prize
at the Royal Show six years in succession, as the competition in those
far-off days was much less keen than that which Pailton Sorais had to
face, and it should be mentioned that she was also a good breeder,
the foal by her side when she was sold made 310 guineas and another
daughter 400 guineas.Such are the kind of Shire mares that farmers want.Those that will
work, win, and breed.As we have seen in this incomplete review, Aurea
won the championship of the London show, together with her son.Belle
Cole, the champion mare of 1908, bred a colt which realized 900 guineas
as a yearling a few days before she herself gained her victory, a clear
proof that showing and breeding are not incompatible.CHAPTER XII

A FEW RECORDS


The highest priced Shires sold by auction have already been given.So a
few of the most notable sales may be mentioned, together with the dates
they were held--

                               84 Shires averaged   188  17    6

These ten are worthy of special mention, although there are several
which come close up to the £200 average.That given first is the most
noteworthy for the reason that Lord Rothschild only sold a portion of
his stud, whereas the executors of the late Lord Egerton of Tatton
sold their whole lot of twenty-one head, hence the higher average.Two clear records were, however, set up at the historical Tring Park
sale in 1913, viz.the highest individual price for a stallion and the
highest average price for animals by one sire, seven sons and daughters
of Childwick Champion, making no less than £927 each, including two
yearling colts.The best average of the nineteenth century was that made at its close
by the late Lord Llangattock, who had given a very high price privately
for Prince Harold, by Harold, which, like his sire, was a very
successful stock horse, his progeny making a splendid average at this
celebrated sale.A spirited bidder at all of the important sales and a
very successful exhibitor, Lord Llangattock did not succeed in winning
either of the London Championships.One private sale during 1900 is worth mentioning, which was that of Mr.James Eadie’s two cup-winning geldings, Bardon Extraordinary and Barrow
Farmer for 225 guineas each, a price which has only been equalled once
to the writer’s knowledge.This was in the autumn of 1910, when Messrs.Truman gave 225 guineas for a gelding, at Messrs.Manley’s Repository,
Crewe, this specimen of the English lorry horse being bought for export
to the United States.In 1894 the late Lord Wantage held a sale which possessed unique
features in that fifty animals catalogued were all sired by the dual
London Champion and Windsor Royal (Jubilee Show) Gold Medal Winner,
Prince William, to whom reference has already been made.As a great supporter of the old English breed, Lord
Wantage, K.C.B., a Crimean veteran, deserves to be bracketed with the
recently deceased Sir Walter Gilbey, inasmuch as that in 1890 he gave
the Lockinge Cup for the best Shire mare exhibited at the London show,
which Starlight succeeded in winning outright for Mr.Sir Walter Gilbey gave the Elsenham Cup for the best stallion, value
100 guineas, in 1884, which, however, was not won permanently till the
late Earl of Ellesmere gained his second championship with Vulcan in
1891.Since these dates the Shire Horse Society has continued to give
the Challenge Cups both for the best stallion and mare.The sales hitherto mentioned have been those of landowners, but it must
not be supposed that tenant farmers have been unable to get Shires
enough to call a home sale.A. H. Clark sold
fifty-one Shires at Moulton Eaugate, the average being £127 5_s._, the
striking feature of this sale being the number of grey (Thumper) mares.F. W. Griffin, another very
successful farmer breeder in the Fens, held a joint sale at Postland,
the former’s average being £100 6_s._ 9_d._, and the latter’s £123
9_s._ 8_d._, each selling twenty-five animals.The last home sale held by a farmer was that of Mr.Matthew Hubbard
at Eaton, Grantham, on November 1, 1912, when an average of £73 was
obtained for fifty-seven lots.Reference has already been made to Harold, Premier, and Prince William,
as sires, but there have been others equally famous since the Shire
Horse Society has been in existence.Among them may be mentioned Bar
None, who won at the 1882 London Show for the late Mr.James Forshaw,
stood for service at his celebrated Carlton Stud Farm for a dozen
seasons, and is credited with having sired over a thousand foals.They
were conspicuous for flat bone and silky feather, when round cannon
bones and curly hair were much more common than they are to-day,
therefore both males and females by Bar None were highly prized; £2000
was refused for at least one of his sons, while a two-year-old daughter
made 800 guineas in 1891.For several years the two sires of Mr.A. C.
Duncombe, at Calwich, Harold and Premier, sired many winners, and in
those days the Ashbourne Foal Show was worth a journey to see.In 1899 Sir P. Albert Muntz took first prize in London with a
big-limbed yearling, Dunsmore Jameson, who turned out to be the sire
of strapping yearlings, two- and three-year-olds, which carried all
before them in the show ring for several years, and a three-year-old
son made the highest price ever realized at any of the Dunsmore Sales,
when the stud was dispersed in 1909.This was 1025 guineas given by
Lord Middleton for Dunsmore Jameson II.For four years in succession,
1903 to 1906, Dunsmore Jameson sired the highest number of winners, not
only in London, but at all the principal shows.His service fee was
fifteen guineas to “approved mares only,” a high figure for a horse
which had only won at the Shire Horse Show as a yearling.Among others
he sired Dunsmore Raider, who in turn begot Dunsmore Chessie, Champion
mare at the London Shows of 1912 and 1913.Jameson contained the blood
of Lincolnshire Lad on both sides of his pedigree.By the 1907 show
another sire had come to the front, and his success was phenomenal;
this was Lockinge Forest King, bred by the late Lord Wantage in 1889,
purchased by the late Mr.J. P. Cross, of Catthorpe Towers, Rugby, who
won first prize, and reserve for the junior cup with him in London as
a three-year-old, also first and champion at the (Carlisle) Royal
Show the same year, 1902.It is worth while to study the breeding of
Lockinge Forest King._Sire_--Lockinge Manners._Great grand sire_--Harold._Great great grand sire_--Lincolnshire Lad II._Great great great grand sire_--Lincolnshire Lad 1196 (Drew’s).The dam of Lockinge Forest King was The Forest Queen (by Royal Albert,
1885, a great sire in his day); she was first prize winner at the Royal
Show, Nottingham, 1888, first and champion, Peterborough, 1888, first
Bath and West, 1887 and 1888, and numerous other prizes.Her dam traced
back to (Dack’s) Matchless (1509), a horse which no less an authority
than the late Mr.James Forshaw described as “the sire of all time.”

This accounts for the marvellous success of Lockinge Forest King as a
stud horse, although his success, unlike Jameson’s, came rather late in
his life of ten years.We have already seen that he
has sired the highest priced Shire mare publicly sold.At the Newcastle
Royal of 1908, both of the gold medal winners were by him, so were
the two champions at the 1909 Shire Horse Show.His most illustrious
family was bred by a tenant farmer, Mr.John Bradley, Halstead, Tilton,
Leicester.The eldest member is Halstead Royal Duke, the London
Champion of 1909, Halstead Blue Blood, 3rd in London, 1910, both owned
by Lord Rothschild, and Halstead Royal Duchess, who won the junior cup
in London for her breeder in 1912.The dam of the trio is Halstead
Duchess III by Menestrel, by Hitchin Conqueror (London Champion, 1890).Two other matrons deserve to be mentioned, as they will always shine in
the history of the Shire breed.One is Lockington Beauty by Champion
457, who died at a good old age at Batsford Park, having produced
Prince William, the champion referred to more than once in these pages,
his sire being William the Conqueror.Then Marmion II (by Harold),
who was first in London in 1891, and realized 1400 guineas at Mr.Also a daughter, Blue Ruin, which won at London Show
of 1889 for Mr.R. N. Sutton-Nelthorpe, but, unfortunately, died from
foaling in that year.Another famous son was Mars Victor, a horse of
great size, and also a London winner, on more than one occasion.Freeman-Mitford (Lord
Redesdale) in the year of his sire’s--Hitchin Conqueror’s--championship
in 1890, for the sum of £1500.Blue Ruin was own sister to Prince William, but the other three were by
different sires.To look at--I saw her in 1890--Lockington Beauty was quite a common
mare with obviously small knees, and none too much weight and width,
her distinguishing feature being a mane of extraordinary length.The remaining dam to be mentioned as a great breeder is Nellie
Blacklegs by Bestwick’s Prince, famous for having bred five sons--which
were all serving mares in the year 1891--and a daughter, all by
Premier.The first was Northwood, a horse used long and successfully by
Lord Middleton and the sire of Birdsall Darling, the dam of Birdsall
Menestrel, London champion of 1904.The second, Hydrometer, first
in London in 1889, then sold to the late Duke of Marlborough, and
purchased when his stud was dispersed in 1893 by the Warwick Shire
Horse Society for 600 guineas.A.
C. Duncombe’s sale in 1891 for 1100 guineas, a record in those days,
to Mr.F. Crisp, who let him to the Peterborough Society in 1892 for
£500.Calwich Topsman, another son, realized 500 guineas when sold, and
Senator made 350.The daughter, rightly named “Sensible,” bred Mr.John
Smith of Ellastone, Ashbourne, a colt foal by Harold in 1893, which
turned out to be Markeaton Royal Harold, the champion stallion of 1897.This chapter was headed “A few records,” and surely this set up by
Premier and Nellie Blacklegs is one.The record show of the Shire Horse Society, as regards the number of
entries, was that of 1904, with a total of 862; the next for size was
the 1902 meeting when 860 were catalogued.Of course the smallest
show was the initial one of 1880, when 76 stallions and 34 mares made
a total of 110 entries.The highest figure yet made in the public
auction sales held at the London Show is 1175 guineas given by Mr.R. Heath, Biddulph Grange, Staffs., in 1911 for Rickford Coming
King, a three-year-old bred by the late Lord Winterstoke, and sold by
his executors, after having won fourth in his class, although first
and reserve for the junior cup as a two-year-old.He was sired by
Ravenspur, with which King Edward won first prize in London, 1906,
his price of 825 guineas to Lord Winterstoke at the Wolferton Sale
of February 8, 1907, being the highest at any sale of that year.The
lesson to be learned is that if you want to create a record with Shires
you must begin and continue with well-bred ones, or you will never
reach the desired end.CHAPTER XIII

C., Newton Solney, Burton-on-Trent.Green, Edward, The Moors, Welshpool.Mackereth, Henry Whittington, Kirkby Lonsdale, Lancs.This list is interesting for the reason that those who have awarded
the prizes at the Shire Horse Show have, to a great extent, fixed the
type to find favour at other important shows.Very often the same
judges have officiated at several important exhibitions during the
same season, which has tended towards uniformity in prize-winning
Shires.On looking down the list, it will be seen that four judges
were appointed till 1895, while the custom of the Society to get its
Council from as many counties as possible has not been followed in
the matter of judges’ selection.For instance, Warwickshire--a great
county for Shire breeding--has only provided two judges in twenty-six
years, and one of them--Mr.Potter--had recently come from Lockington
Grounds, Derby, where he bred the renowned Prince William.For many
years Hertfordshire has provided a string of winners, yet no judge has
hailed from that county, or from Surrey, which contains quite a number
of breeders of Shire horses.No fault whatever is being found with the
way the judging has been carried out.It is no light task, and nobody
but an expert could, or should, undertake it; but it is only fair to
point out that high-class Shires are, and have been, bred in Cornwall,
and Devonshire, Kent, and every other county, while the entries at the
show of 1914 included a stallion bred in the Isle of Man.In 1890, as elsewhere stated, the membership of the Society was 1615,
whereas the number of members given in the 1914 volume of the Stud Book
is 4200.The aim of each and all is “to improve the Old English breed
of Cart Horses,” many of which may now be truthfully described by their
old title of “War Horses.”




CHAPTER XIV

THE EXPORT TRADE


Among the first to recognize the enormous power and possibilities of
the Shire were the Americans.Very few London shows had been held
before they were looking out for fully-registered specimens to take
across the Atlantic.Towards the close of the ’eighties a great export
trade was done, the climax being reached in 1889, when the Shire Horse
Society granted 1264 export certificates.A society to safeguard the
interests of the breed was formed in America, these being the remarks
of Mr.A. Galbraith (President of the American Shire Horse Society) in
his introductory essay: “At no time in the history of the breed have
first-class animals been so valuable as now, the praiseworthy endeavour
to secure the best specimens of the breed having the natural effect of
enhancing prices all round.Breeders of Shire horses both in England
and America have a hopeful and brilliant future before them, and by
exercising good judgment in their selections, and giving due regard to
pedigree and soundness, as well as individual merit, they will not only
reap a rich pecuniary reward, but prove a blessing and a benefit to
this country.”

From the day that the Shire Horse Society was incorporated, on June
3, 1878, until now, America has been Britain’s best overseas customer
for Shire horses, a good second being our own colony, the Dominion of
Canada.Another stockbreeding country to make an early discovery of the
merits of “The Great Horse” was Argentina, to which destination many
good Shires have gone.In 1906 the number given in the Stud Book was
118.So much importance is attached to the breed both in the United
States and in the Argentine Republic that English judges have travelled
to each of those country’s shows to award the prizes in the Shire
Classes.Another great country with which a good and growing trade has been done
is Russia.In 1904 the number was eleven, in 1913 it had increased to
fifty-two, so there is evidently a market there which is certain to be
extended when peace has been restored and our powerful ally sets about
the stupendous, if peaceful, task of replenishing her horse stock.Our other allies have their own breeds of draught horses, therefore
they have not been customers for Shires, but with war raging in their
breeding grounds, the numbers must necessarily be reduced almost to
extinction, consequently the help of the Shire may be sought for
building up their breeds in days to come.German buyers have not fancied Shire horses to any extent--British-bred
re-mounts have been more in their line.In 1905, however, Germany was the destination of thirty-one.By 1910
the number had declined to eleven, and in 1913 to three, therefore, if
the export of trade in Shires to “The Fatherland” is altogether lost,
English breeders will scarcely feel it.Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa are parts of the British
Empire to which Shires have been shipped for several years.Substantial
prizes in the shape of Cups and Medals are now given by the Shire
Horse Society to the best specimens of the breed exhibited at Foreign
and Colonial Shows.ENCOURAGING THE EXPORT OF SHIRES

The following is reprinted from the “Farmer and Stockbreeder Year Book”
for 1906, and was written by S. H. L.(J. A. Frost):--

    “The Old English breed of cart horse, or ‘Shire,’ is
    universally admitted to be the best and most valuable animal
    for draught purposes in the world, and a visitor from America,
    Mr.Morrow, of the United States Department of Agriculture,
    speaking at Mr.John Rowell’s sale of Shires in 1889, said,
    ‘Great as had been the business done in Shire horses in
    America, the trade is but in its infancy, for the more Shire
    horses became known, and the more they came into competition
    with other breeds, the more their merits for all heavy draught
    purposes were appreciated.’

    “These remarks are true to-day, for although sixteen years have
    elapsed since they were made (1906), the massive Shire has more
    than held his own, but in the interests of the breed, and of
    the nearly four thousand members of the Shire Horse Society,
    it is still doubtful whether the true worth of the Shire
    horse is properly known and appreciated in foreign countries
    and towns needing heavy horses, and whether the export trade
    in this essentially British breed is not capable of further
    development.The number of export certificates granted by the
    Shire Horse Society in 1889 was 1264, which takes a good deal
    of beating, but it must be remembered that since then Shire
    horse breeding at home has progressed by leaps and bounds,
    and tenant farmers, who could only look on in those days,
    are now members of the flourishing Shire Horse Society and
    owners of breeding studs, and such prices as 800 guineas for a
    two-year-old filly and 230 guineas for a nine-months-old colt,
    are less frequently obtainable than they were then; therefore,
    an increase in the demand from other countries would find more
    Shire breeders ready to supply it, although up to the present
    the home demand has been and is very good, and weighty geldings
    continue to be scarce and dear.”


THE NUMBER EXPORTED

“It may be true that the number of horses exported during the last year
or two has been higher than ever, but when the average value of those
that go to ‘other countries’ than Holland, Belgium, and France, is
worked out, it does not allow of such specimens as would excite the
admiration of a foreign merchant or Colonial farmer being exported,
except in very isolated instances; then the tendency of American buyers
is to give preference to stallions which are on the quality rather than
on the weighty side, and as the mares to which they are eventually put
are also light boned, the typical English dray horse is not produced.“During the past year (1905) foreign buyers have been giving very
high prices for Shorthorn cattle, and if they would buy in the same
spirited manner at the Shire sales, a much more creditable animal
could be obtained for shipment.As an advertisement for the Shire
it is obviously beneficial that the Shire Horse Society--which is
unquestionably the most successful breed society in existence--gives
prizes for breeding stock and also geldings at a few of the most
important horse shows in the United States.This tends to bring the
breed into prominence abroad, and it is certain that many Colonial
farmers would rejoice at being able to breed working geldings of a
similar type to those which may be seen shunting trucks on any large
railway station in England, or walking smartly along in front of a
binder in harvest.The writer has a relative farming in the North-West
Territory of Canada, and his last letter says, ‘The only thing in
the stock line that there is much money in now is horses; they are
keeping high, and seem likely to for years, as so many new settlers are
coming in all the time, and others do not seem able to raise enough
for their own needs’; and it may be mentioned that almost the only
kind of stallions available there are of the Percheron breed, which
is certainly not calculated to improve the size, or substance, of the
native draught horse stock.THE COST OF SHIPPING

“The cost of shipping a horse from Liverpool to New York is about £11,
which is not prohibitive for such an indispensable animal as the Shire
horse, and if such specimens of the breed as the medal winners at shows
like Peterborough could be exhibited in the draught horse classes at
the best horse shows of America, it is more than probable that at least
some of the visitors would be impressed with their appearance, and an
increase in the export trade in Shires might thereby be brought about.“A few years ago the price of high-class Shire stallions ran upwards of
a thousand pounds, which placed them beyond the reach of exporters;
but the reign of what may be called ‘fancy’ prices appears to be
over, at least for a time, seeing that the general sale averages have
declined since that of Lord Llangattock in October, 1900, when the
record average of £226 1_s._ 8_d._ was made, although the best general
average for the sales of any single year was obtained in 1901, viz.£112 5_s._ 10_d._ for 633 animals, and it was during that year that the
highest price for Shires was obtained at an auction sale, the sum being
1550 guineas, given by Mr.Leopold Salomons, for the stallion Hendre
Champion, at the late Mr.Crisp’s sale at Girton.Other high-priced
stallions purchased by auction include Marmion II., 1400 guineas, and
Chancellor, 1100 guineas, both by Mr.Waresley Premier Duke,
1100 guineas, and Hendre Crown Prince, 1100 guineas, were two purchases
of Mr.These figures show that the
worth of a really good Shire stallion can hardly be estimated, and
it is certain that the market for this particular class of animal is
by no means glutted, but rather the reverse, as the number of males
offered at the stud sales is always limited, which proves that there
is ‘room on the top’ for the stallion breeder, and with this fact in
view and the possible chance of an increased foreign trade in stallions
it behoves British breeders of Shires to see to it that there is no
falling off in the standard of the horses ‘raised,’ to use the American
word, but rather that a continual improvement is aimed at, so that
visitors from horse-breeding countries may find what they want if they
come to ‘the stud farm of the world.’

“The need to keep to the right lines and breed from good old stock
which has produced real stock-getting stallions cannot be too strongly
emphasised, for the reason that there is a possibility of the British
market being overstocked with females, with a corresponding dearth of
males, both stallions and geldings, and although this is a matter which
breeders cannot control they can at least patronise a strain of blood
famous for its males.The group of Premier--Nellie Blacklegs’ brothers,
Northwood, Hydrometer, Senator, and Calwich Topsman--may be quoted as
showing the advisability of continuing to use the same horse year after
year if colt foals are bred, and wanted, and the sire is a horse of
merit.“With the number of breeders of Shire horses and the plentiful supply
of mares, together with the facilities offered by local stallion-hiring
societies, it ought not to be impossible to breed enough high-grade
sires to meet the home demand and leave a surplus for export as well,
and the latter of the class that will speak for themselves in other
countries, and lead to enquiries for more of the same sort.FEW HIGH PRICES FROM EXPORTERS

“It is noteworthy that few, if any, of the high prices obtained for
Shires at public sales have come from exporters or buyers from abroad,
but from lovers of the heavy breed in England, who have been either
forming or replenishing studs, therefore, ‘the almighty dollar’ has not
been responsible for the figures above quoted.Still it is probable
that with the opening up of the agricultural industry in Western
Canada, South Africa, and elsewhere, Shire stallions will be needed to
help the Colonial settlers to build up a breed of horses which will be
useful for both tillage and haulage purposes.“The adaptability of the Shire horse to climate and country is well
known, and it is satisfactory for home breeders to hear that Mr.Martinez de Hoz has recently sold ten Shires, bred in Argentina, at an
average of £223 2_s._ 6_d._, one, a three-year-old, making £525.“Meanwhile it might be a good investment if a syndicate of British
breeders placed a group of typical Shire horses in a few of the biggest
fairs or shows in countries where weighty horses are wanted, and thus
further the interests of the Shire abroad, and assist in developing the
export trade.”

It may be added that during the summer of 1906, H.M.King Edward and
Lord Rothschild sent a consignment of Shires to the United States of
America for exhibition.CHAPTER XV

PROMINENT PRESENT-DAY STUDS


Seeing that Lord Rothschild has won the greatest number of challenge
cups and holds the record for having made the highest price, his name
is mentioned first among owners of famous studs.He joined the Shire Horse Society in February, 1891, and at the show
of 1892 made five entries for the London Show at which he purchased
the second prize three-year-old stallion Carbonite (by Carbon by
Lincolnshire Lad II.)He is
remembered by the writer as being a wide and weighty horse on short
legs which carried long hair in attendance, and this type has been
found at Tring Park ever since.In 1895 his lordship won first and
third with two chestnut fillies--Vulcan’s Flower by the Champion Vulcan
and Walkern Primrose by Hitchin Duke (by Bar None).The former won the
Filly Cup and was subsequently sold to help to found the famous stud
of Sir Walpole Greenwell at Marden Park, Surrey, the sum given being a
very high one for those days.The first championship was obtained with the mare Alston Rose in 1901,
which won like honours for Mr.R. W. Hudson in 1902, after costing him
750 guineas at the second sale at Tring Park, January 15, 1902.Solace, bred by King Edward, was the next champion mare from Lord
Rothschild’s stud.Girton Charmer, winner of the Challenge Cup in
1905, was included in a select shipment of Shires sent to America (as
models of the breed) by our late lamented King and Lord Rothschild in
1906.Princess Beryl, Belle Cole, Chiltern Maid, were mares to win
highest honours for the stud, while a young mare which passed through
Lord Rothschild’s hands, and realized a four-figure sum for him as
a two-year-old from the Devonshire enthusiasts, Messrs.W. and H.
Whitley, is Lorna Doone, the Champion mare of 1914.Champion’s Goalkeeper, the Tring record-breaker, has been mentioned,
so we can now refer to the successful stud of which he is the central
figure, viz.that owned by Sir Walpole Greenwell at Marden Park,
Woldingham, Surrey, who, as we have seen, bought a good filly from the
Tring Stud in 1895, the year in which he became a member of the Shire
Horse Society.At Lord Rothschild’s first sale in 1898, he purchased
Windley Lily for 430 guineas, and Moorish Maiden, a three-year-old
filly, for 350, since when he has bid only for the best.At the
Tandridge dispersion sale he gave over a thousand pounds for the
Lockinge Forest King mare, Fuchsia of Tandridge, and her foal.Sir
Walpole was one of the first to profit by the Lockinge Forest King
blood, his filly, Marden Peach, by that sire having been a winner at
the Royal of 1908, while her daughter, Marden Constance, has had a
brilliant show career, so has Dunsmore Chessie, purchased from Mr.T.
Ewart as a yearling, twice London Champion mare.No sale has been held at Marden, but consignments have been sold at
Peterborough, so that the prefix is frequently met with.The stud owner who is willing to give £4305 for a two-year-old colt
deserves success.THE PRIMLEY STUD

At the Dunsmore Sale on February 14, 1907, Mr.W. Whitley purchased
Dunsmore Fuchsia (by Jameson), the London Cup winner of 1905 and 1906,
for 520 guineas, also Quality by the same sire, and these two won
second and third for him in London the same month, this being the first
show at which the Primley shires took honours.The purchase of Tatton Dray King, the Champion stallion of 1908, by
Messrs.W. and H. Whitley in the spring of 1909 for 3700 guineas
created quite a sensation, as it was an outstanding record, it stood so
for nearly four years.One of the most successful show mares in this--or any--stud is
Mollington Movement by Lockinge Forest King, but the reigning queen is
Lorna Doone, the London and Peterborough Champion of 1914, purchased
privately from the Tring Park Stud.Another built on the same lines
is Sussex Pride with which a Bucks tenant farmer, Mr.R. H. Keene,
won first and reserve champion at the London Show of 1913, afterwards
selling her to Messrs.Whitley, who again won with her in 1914.With
such animals as these Devonshire is likely to hold its own with Shires,
although they do not come from the district known to the law makers of
old as the breeding ground of “the Great Horse.”


THE PENDLEY FEMALES

One of the most successful exhibitors of mares, fillies, and foals, at
the shows of the past few seasons has been Mr.J. G. Williams, Pendley
Manor, Tring.Like other exhibitors already mentioned, the one under
notice owes much of his success to Lockinge Forest King.In 1908 Lord
Egerton’s Tatton May Queen was purchased for 420 guineas, she having
been first in London as a yearling and two-year-old; Bardon Forest
Princess, a reserve London Champion, and Barnfields Forest Queen, Cup
winner there, made a splendid team of winners by the sire named.At the
Tring Park sale of 1913 Mr.Williams gave the highest price made by
a female, 825 guineas, for Halstead Duchess VII., by Redlynch Forest
King.She won the Royal Championship at Bristol for him.One of the
later acquisitions is Snelston Lady, by Slipton King, Cup winner and
reserve Champion in London, 1914, as a three-year-old, first at the
Royal, and reserve Champion at Peterborough.Williams joined the
Shire Horse Society in 1906, since when he has won all but the London
Championship with his mares and fillies.A NEW STUD

After Champion’s Goalkeeper was knocked down Mr.Beck announced that
the disappointed bidder was Mr.C. R. H. Gresson, acting for the
Edgcote Shorthorn Company, Wardington, Banbury, his date of admission
to the Shire Horse Society being during that same month, February,
1913.Having failed to get the popular colt, his stable companion and
half brother, Stockman III., was purchased for 540 guineas, and shown
in London just after, where he won fourth prize.From this single entry
in 1913 the foundation of the stud was so rapid that seven entries
were made at the 1914 London Show.Fine Feathers was the first prize
yearling filly, Blackthorn Betty the second prize two-year-old filly,
the own bred Edgcote Monarch being the second prize yearling colt.After the show Lord Rothschild’s first prize two-year colt, Orfold
Blue Blood, was bought, together with Normandy Jessie, the third prize
yearling colt; so with these two, Fine Feathers, Betty, Chirkenhill
Forest Queen, and Writtle Coming Queen, the Edgcote Shorthorn Co.,
Ltd., took a leading place at the shows of 1914.In future Edgcote
promises to be as famous for its Shires as it has hitherto been for its
Shorthorns.DUCAL STUDS

A very successful exhibitor of the past season has been his Grace
the Duke of Westminster, who owns a very good young sire in Eaton
Nunsuch--so good that he has been hired by the Peterborough Society.Shires have been bred on the Eaton Hall estate for many years, and the
stud contains many promising animals now.Mention must be made of the great interest taken in Shires by the Duke
of Devonshire who, as the Hon.Victor Cavendish, kept a first-class
stud at Holker, Lancs.At the Royal Show of 1909 (Gloucester) Holker
Mars was the Champion Shire stallion, Warton Draughtsman winning the
Norwich Royal Championship, and also that of the London Show of 1912
for his popular owner.OTHER STUDS

Among those who have done much to promote the breeding of the Old
English type of cart-horse, the name of Mr.Clement Keevil deserves
a foremost place.At Blagdon, Malden, Surrey, he held a number of
stud sales in the eighties and nineties, to which buyers went for
massive-limbed Shires of the good old strains; those with a pedigree
which traced back to Honest Tom (_alias_ Little David), foaled in the
year 1769, to Wiseman’s Honest Tom, foaled in 1800, or to Samson a sire
weighing 1 ton 8 cwt.Later he had a stud at Billington, Beds, where
several sales were held, the last being in 1908, when Mr.Everard gave
860 guineas for the stallion, Lockinge Blagdon.Shortly before that he
sold Blagdon Benefactor for 1000 guineas.The prefix “Birdsall” has been seen in show catalogues for a number of
years, which mean that the animals holding it were bred, or owned, by
Lord Middleton, at Birdsall, York, he being one of the first noblemen
to found a stud, and he has ably filled the Presidential Chair of the
Shire Horse Society.As long ago as the 1892 London Show there were two
entries from Birdsall by Lord Middleton’s own sire, Northwood, to which
reference is made elsewhere.Another notable sire purchased by his lordship was Menestrel, first in
London, 1900 (by Hitchin Conqueror), his most famous son being Birdsall
Menestrel, dam Birdsall Darling by Northwood, sold to Lord Rothschild
as a yearling.As a two-year-old this colt was Cup winner and reserve
Champion, and at four he was Challenge Cup winner.A good bidder at
Shire sales, the breeder of a champion, and a consistent supporter of
the Shire breeding industry since 1883, it is regrettable that champion
honours have not fallen to Lord Middleton himself.Another stud, which was founded near Leeds, by Mr.A. Grandage, has
now been removed to Cheshire.Joining the Shire Horse Society in 1892,
his first entry in London was made in 1893, and four years later, in
1897, Queen of the Shires (by Harold) won the mare Championship for Mr.In 1909 the winning four-year-old stallion, Gaer Conqueror, of
Lincolnshire Lad descent, was bought from Mr.Edward Green for 825
guineas, which proved to be a real good investment for Mr.Grandage,
seeing that he won the championship of the Shire Horse Show for the two
following years, 1910 and 1911.Candidates from the Bramhope Stud, Monks Heath, Chelford, Cheshire, are
likely to give a very good account of themselves in the days to come.Among those who will have the best Shires is Sir Arthur Nicholson,
Highfield, Leek, Staffs.His first London success was third prize with
Rokeby Friar (by Harold) as a two-year-old in 1893, since which date he
has taken a keen personal interest in the breeding of Shire horses, and
has the honour of having purchased Pailton Sorais, the highest-priced
mare yet sold by auction.At the Tring sale of 1913 he gave the second
highest price of that day, viz., 1750 guineas for the three-year-old
stallion, Blacklands Kingmaker, who won first prize for him in London
ten days after, but, alas, was taken ill during his season, for the
Winslow Shire Horse Society, and died.Another bad loss to Sir Arthur
and to Shire breeders generally was the death of Redlynch Forest King,
seeing that he promised to rival his renowned sire, Lockinge Forest
King, for begetting show animals.Among the many good ones recently exhibited from the stud may be
mentioned Leek Dorothy, twice first in London, and Leek Challenger,
first as a yearling, second as a two-year-old, both of these being by
Redlynch Forest King.With such as these coming on there is a future
before the Shires of Sir Arthur Nicholson.The name of Muntz is familiar to all Shire breeders owing to the fame
achieved by the late Sir P. Albert Muntz.F. E. Muntz,
of Umberslade, Hockley Heath, Warwickshire, a nephew of the Dunsmore
Baronet, joined the Shire Horse Society, and has since been President.Quite a good share of prizes have fallen to him, including the Cup for
the best old stallion in London both in 1913 and 1914.The winner,
Danesfield Stonewall, was reserved for the absolute championship on
both occasions, and this typical “Old English Black” had a host of
admirers, while Jones--the Umberslade stud groom--will never forget his
parade before His Majesty King George at the 1913 show.It used to be said that Shires did not flourish south of London, but
Mr.Leopold Salomons, Norbury Park, Dorking, has helped to prove
otherwise.Beginning with one entry at the 1899 Show, he has entered
quite a string for several years, and the stud contains a number of
high-class stallions, notably Norbury Menestrel, winner of many prizes,
and a particularly well-bred and promising sire, and King of Tandridge
(by Lockinge Forest King), purchased by Mr.Salomons at the Tandridge
dispersion sale for 1600 guineas.At the sale during the London Show of
1914 Mr.Salomons realized the highest price with his own bred Norbury
Coronation, by Norbury Menestrel, who, after winning third prize in his
class, cost the Leigh Shire Horse Society 850 guineas, Norbury George,
by the same sire, winning fifth prize, and making 600 guineas, both
being three years old.This is the kind of advertisement for a stud,
no matter where its situation.Another Surrey enthusiast is Sir Edward Stern, Fan Court, Chertsey, who
has been a member of the Shire Horse Society since 1903.He purchased
Danesfield Stonewall from Mr.R. W. Hudson, and won several prizes
before re-selling him to Mr.His stud horses now includes
Marathon II., champion at the Oxford County Show of 1910.Mares and
fillies have also been successfully shown at the Royal Counties, and
other meetings in the south of England from the Fan Court establishment.A fine lot of Shires have been got together, at Tarnacre House,
Garstang, and the first prize yearling at the London Show of 1914,
King’s Choice, was bred by Messrs.J. E. and A. W. Potter, who also won
first with Monnow Drayman, the colt with which Mr.John Ferneyhough
took first prize as a three-year-old.With stallions of his type and
mares as wide, deep, and well-bred as Champion’s Choice (by Childwick
Champion), Shires full of character should be forthcoming from these
Lancashire breeders.The Carlton Stud continues to flourish, although its founder, the late
Mr.James Forshaw, departed this life in 1908.His business abilities
and keen judgment have been inherited by his sons, one of whom judged
in London last year (1914), as his father did in 1900.This being a
record in Shire Horse history for father and son to judge at the great
Show of the breed.Carlton has always been famous for its stallions.It has furnished
London winners from the first, including the Champions Stroxton Tom
(1902 and 1903), Present King II.(1906), and Stolen Duchess, the
Challenge Cup winning mare of 1907.Forshaw and his sons are too numerous
to mention in detail.Another very
impressive stallion was What’s Wanted, the sire of Mr.A. C. Duncombe’s
Premier (also mentioned in another chapter), and a large family of
celebrated sons.His great grandsire was (Dack’s) Matchless 1509, a
great sire in the Fen country, which travelled through Moulton Eaugate
for thirteen consecutive seasons.Forshaw’s opinion
of him is given on another page.One of the most successful Carlton
sires of recent years has been Drayman XXIII., whose son, Tatton Dray
King, won highest honours in London, and realized 3700 guineas when
sold.Seeing that prizes were being won by stallions from this stud
through several decades of last century, and that a large number have
been travelled each season since, while a very large export trade has
been done by Messrs.Forshaw and Sons, it need hardly be said that the
influence of this stud has been world-wide.It is impossible to mention all the existing studs in a little book
like this, but three others will be now mentioned for the reason that
they are carried on by those who formerly managed successful studs,
therefore they have “kept the ball rolling,” viz.Thomas
Ewart, at Dunsmore, who made purchases on his own behalf when the stud
of the late Sir P. A. Muntz--which he had managed for so long--was
dispersed, and has since brought out many winners, the most famous of
which is Dunsmore Chessie.R. H. Keene, under whose care the Shires
of Mr.R. W. Hudson (Past-President of the Shire Horse Society) at
Danesfield attained to such prominence, although not actually taking
over the prefix, took a large portion of the land, and carries on Shire
breeding quite successfully on his own account.The other of this class to be named is Mr.C. E. McKenna, who took over
the Bardon stud from Mr.B. N. Everard when the latter decided to let
the Leicestershire stud farm where Lockinge Forest King spent his last
and worthiest years.Such enterprise gives farmers and men of moderate
means faith in the great and growing industry of Shire Horse breeding.Of stud owners who have climbed to prominence, although neither
landowners, merchant princes, nor erstwhile stud managers, may be
mentioned Mr.James Gould, Crouchley Lymm, Cheshire, whose Snowdon
Menestrel was first in his class and reserve for the Stallion Cup at
the 1914 London Show; Messrs.E. and J. Whinnerah, Warton, Carnforth,
who won seventh prize with Warton Draughtsman in 1910, afterwards
selling him to the Duke of Devonshire, who reached the top of the tree
with him two years later.Henry Mackereth, the new London judge of 1915, entered the
exhibitors’ list at the London Show of 1899.Perhaps his most notable
horse is Lunesdale Kingmaker, with which Lord Rothschild won fourth
prize in 1907, he being the sire of Messrs.Potter’s King’s Choice
above mentioned.Many other studs well meriting notice could be dealt with did time and
space permit, including that of a tenant farmer who named one of his
best colts “Sign of Riches,” which must be regarded as an advertisement
for the breed from a farmer’s point of view.Of past studs only one will be mentioned, that of the late Sir Walter
Gilbey, the dispersal having taken place on January 13, 1915.The first
Shire sale at Elsenham was held in 1885--thirty years ago--when the
late Lord Wantage gave the highest price, 475 guineas, for Glow, by
Spark, the average of £172 4_s._ 6_d._ being unbeaten till the Scawby
sale of 1891 (which was £198 17_s._ 3_d._).Sir Walter has been mentioned as one of the founders of the Shire Horse
Society; his services in aid of horse breeding were recognized by
presenting him with his portrait in oils, the subscribers numbering
1250.The presentation was made by King Edward (then Prince of Wales)
at the London Show of 1891.CHAPTER XVI

THE FUTURE OUTLOOK


This book is written when war, and all that pertains to it, is the
absorbing topic.In fact, no other will be listened to.What is
the good of talking about such a peaceful occupation as that of
agriculture while the nation is fighting for its very existence?To a
certain extent this can be understood, but stock breeding, and more
particularly horse breeding, cannot be suspended for two or three
seasons and then resumed without causing a gap in the supply of horses
coming along for future use.The cry of the army authorities is for “more and more men,” together
with a demand for a constant supply of horses of many types, including
the weight-moving War Horse, and if the supply is used up, with no
provision being made for a quantity of four-footed recruits to haul the
guns or baggage waggons in the days to come, the British Army, and
most others, will be faced with a problem not easily solved.The motor-mad mechanic may think that his chance has come, but generals
who have to lead an army over water-logged plains, or snow-covered
mountains, will demand horses, hitherto--and henceforth--indispensable
for mounting soldiers on, rushing their guns quickly into position, or
drawing their food supplies and munitions of war after them.When the mechanic has provided horseless vehicles to do all this,
horse breeding can be ignored by fighting men--not before.But horses,
particularly draft horses, are needed for commercial use.So far, coal
merchants are horse users, while brewers, millers, and other lorry
users have not altogether discarded the horse-drawn vehicle.For taking loads to and from the landing stage at Liverpool heavy
horses will be in great demand after the war--perhaps greater than they
have ever been.The railways will continue to exist, and, while they
do, powerful Shire geldings must be employed; no other can put the
necessary weight into the collar for shunting loaded trucks.During the autumn of 1914 no other kind of advice--although they got
plenty of it--was so freely and so frequently given to farmers as this,
“grow more wheat.”

If this has been acted upon, and there is no doubt that it has, at
least to some extent, it follows, as sure as the night follows the day,
that more horses will be required by those who grow the wheat.The land
has to be ploughed and cultivated, the crop drilled, cut, carted home
and delivered to mill, or railway truck, all meaning horse labour.It may happen that large farmers will use motor ploughs or steam
waggons, but these are beyond the reach of the average English farmer.Moreover, when bought they depreciate in value, whether working or
standing idle, which is exactly what the Shire gelding or brood mare
does not do.If properly cared for and used they appreciate in value
from the time they are put to work until they are six or seven years
old, and by that age most farmers have sold their non-breeders to make
room for younger animals.Horse power is therefore the cheapest and
most satisfactory power for most farmers to use in front of field
implements and farm waggons, a fact which is bound to tell in favour of
the Shire in the coming times of peace which we anticipate.When awarding prizes for the best managed farm, the judges appointed by
the Royal Agricultural Society of England are instructed to consider--

“General Management with a view to profit,” so that any breed of live
stock which leaves a profit would help a competitor.Only a short time ago a Warwickshire tenant farmer told his landlord
that Shire horses had enabled himself and many others to attend the
rent audit, “with a smile on his face and the rent in his pocket.”

Most landlords are prepared to welcome a tenant in that state,
therefore they should continue to encourage the industry as they have
done during the past twenty-five years.Wars come to an end--the “Thirty Years’ War” did--so let us remember
the Divine promise to Noah after the flood, “While the earth remaineth
seedtime and harvest … shall not cease,” Gen.As long as there is
sowing and reaping to be done horses--Shire horses--will be wanted.“Far back in the ages
      The plough with wreaths was crowned;
    The hands of kings and sages
      Entwined the chaplet round;
    Till men of spoil disdained the toil
      By which the world was nourished,
    And dews of blood enriched the soil
      Where green their laurels flourished:
    Now the world her fault repairs--
      The guilt that stains her story;
    And weeps; her crimes amid the cares
      That formed her earliest glory.The glory, earned in deadly fray,
      Shall fade, decay and perish.Honour waits, o’er all the Earth
      Through endless generations,
    The art that calls her harvests forth
      And feeds the expectant nations.”

                                THE END

VINTON & COMPANY, LTD., 8, BREAM’S BUILDINGS, CHANCERY LANE, LONDON, E.C.He was "ill pitten the gither" to
begin with, but many of his physical defects were the penalties of his
work, and endeared him to the Glen.That ugly scar that cut into his
right eyebrow and gave him such a sinister expression, was got one night
Jess slipped on the ice and laid him insensible eight miles from home.His limp marked the big snowstorm in the fifties, when his horse missed
the road in Glen Urtach, and they rolled together in a drift.MacLure
escaped with a broken leg and the fracture of three ribs, but he never
walked like other men again.He could not swing himself into the saddle
without making two attempts and holding Jess's mane.Neither can you
"warstle" through the peat bogs and snow drifts for forty winters
without a touch of rheumatism.But they were honorable scars, and for
such risks of life men get the Victoria Cross in other fields.[Illustration: "FOR SUCH RISKS OF LIFE MEN GET THE VICTORIA CROSS IN
OTHER FIELDS"]

MacLure got nothing but the secret affection of the Glen, which knew
that none had ever done one-tenth as much for it as this ungainly,
twisted, battered figure, and I have  seen a Drumtochty face
soften at the sight of MacLure limping to his horse.Hopps earned the ill-will of the Glen for ever by criticising
the doctor's dress, but indeed it would have filled any townsman with
amazement.Black he wore once a year, on Sacrament Sunday, and, if
possible, at a funeral; topcoat or waterproof never.His jacket and
waistcoat were rough homespun of Glen Urtach wool, which threw off the
wet like a duck's back, and below he was clad in shepherd's tartan
trousers, which disappeared into unpolished riding boots.His shirt was
grey flannel, and he was uncertain about a collar, but certain as to a
tie which he never had, his beard doing instead, and his hat was soft
felt of four colors and seven different shapes.His point of distinction
in dress was the trousers, and they were the subject of unending
speculation."Some threep that he's worn thae eedentical pair the last twenty year,
an' a' mind masel him gettin' a tear ahint, when he was crossin' oor
palin', and the mend's still veesible."Ithers declare 'at he's got a wab o' claith, and hes a new pair made in
Muirtown aince in the twa year maybe, and keeps them in the garden till
the new look wears aff."For ma ain pairt," Soutar used to declare, "a' canna mak up my mind,
but there's ae thing sure, the Glen wud not like tae see him withoot
them: it wud be a shock tae confidence.There's no muckle o' the check
left, but ye can aye tell it, and when ye see thae breeks comin' in ye
ken that if human pooer can save yir bairn's life it 'ill be dune."The confidence of the Glen--and tributary states--was unbounded, and
rested partly on long experience of the doctor's resources, and partly
on his hereditary connection."His father was here afore him," Mrs.Macfadyen used to explain; "atween
them they've hed the countyside for weel on tae a century; if MacLure
disna understand oor constitution, wha dis, a' wud like tae ask?"For Drumtochty had its own constitution and a special throat disease, as
became a parish which was quite self-contained between the woods and the
hills, and not dependent on the lowlands either for its diseases or its
doctors."He's a skilly man, Doctor MacLure," continued my friend Mrs.Macfayden,
whose judgment on sermons or anything else was seldom at fault; "an'
a kind-hearted, though o' coorse he hes his faults like us a', an' he
disna tribble the Kirk often."He aye can tell what's wrang wi' a body, an' maistly he can put ye
richt, and there's nae new-fangled wys wi' him: a blister for the
ootside an' Epsom salts for the inside dis his wark, an' they say
there's no an herb on the hills he disna ken."If we're tae dee, we're tae dee; an' if we're tae live, we're tae live,"
concluded Elspeth, with sound Calvinistic logic; "but a'll say this
for the doctor, that whether yir tae live or dee, he can aye keep up a
sharp meisture on the skin.""But he's no veera ceevil gin ye bring him when there's naethin' wrang,"
and Mrs.Macfayden's face reflected another of Mr.Hopps' misadventures
of which Hillocks held the copyright."Hopps' laddie ate grosarts (gooseberries) till they hed to sit up a'
nicht wi' him, an' naethin' wud do but they maun hae the doctor, an' he
writes 'immediately' on a slip o' paper."Weel, MacLure had been awa a' nicht wi' a shepherd's wife Dunleith wy,
and he comes here withoot drawin' bridle, mud up tae the cen."'What's a dae here, Hillocks?"he cries; 'it's no an accident, is't?'and when he got aff his horse he cud hardly stand wi' stiffness and
tire."'It's nane o' us, doctor; it's Hopps' laddie; he's been eatin' ower
mony berries.'[Illustration: "HOPPS' LADDIE ATE GROSARTS"]

"If he didna turn on me like a tiger."<DW37> ye mean tae say----'

"'Weesht, weesht,' an' I tried tae quiet him, for Hopps wes comin' oot."'Well, doctor,' begins he, as brisk as a magpie, 'you're here at last;
there's no hurry with you Scotchmen.My boy has been sick all night, and
I've never had one wink of sleep.You might have come a little quicker,
that's all I've got to say.'"We've mair tae dae in Drumtochty than attend tae every bairn that hes a
sair stomach,' and a' saw MacLure wes roosed.Our doctor at home always says to
Mrs.'Opps "Look on me as a family friend, Mrs.'Opps, and send for me
though it be only a headache."'"'He'd be mair sparin' o' his offers if he hed four and twenty mile tae
look aifter.There's naethin' wrang wi' yir laddie but greed.Gie him a
gude dose o' castor oil and stop his meat for a day, an' he 'ill be a'
richt the morn.'"'He 'ill not take castor oil, doctor.We have given up those barbarous
medicines.'"'Whatna kind o' medicines hae ye noo in the Sooth?'MacLure, we're homoeopathists, and I've my little
chest here,' and oot Hopps comes wi' his boxy."'Let's see't,' an' MacLure sits doon and taks oot the bit bottles, and
he reads the names wi' a lauch every time."'Belladonna; did ye ever hear the like?Weel, ma mannie,' he says tae Hopps, 'it's a fine
ploy, and ye 'ill better gang on wi' the Nux till it's dune, and gie him
ony ither o' the sweeties he fancies."'Noo, Hillocks, a' maun be aff tae see Drumsheugh's grieve, for he's
doon wi' the fever, and it's tae be a teuch fecht.A' hinna time tae
wait for dinner; gie me some cheese an' cake in ma haund, and Jess 'ill
tak a pail o' meal an' water."'Fee; a'm no wantin' yir fees, man; wi' that boxy ye dinna need a
doctor; na, na, gie yir siller tae some puir body, Maister Hopps,' an'
he was doon the road as hard as he cud lick."His fees were pretty much what the folk chose to give him, and he
collected them once a year at Kildrummie fair."Well, doctor, what am a' awin' ye for the wife and bairn?Ye 'ill need
three notes for that nicht ye stayed in the hoose an' a' the veesits.""Havers," MacLure would answer, "prices are low, a'm hearing; gie's
thirty shillings.""No, a'll no, or the wife 'ill tak ma ears off," and it was settled for
two pounds.Lord Kilspindie gave him a free house and fields, and one
way or other, Drumsheugh told me, the doctor might get in about L150.a year, out of which he had to pay his old housekeeper's wages and a
boy's, and keep two horses, besides the cost of instruments and books,
which he bought through a friend in Edinburgh with much judgment.There was only one man who ever complained of the doctor's charges, and
that was the new farmer of Milton, who was so good that he was above
both churches, and held a meeting in his barn.(It was Milton the Glen
supposed at first to be a Mormon, but I can't go into that now.)He
offered MacLure a pound less than he asked, and two tracts, whereupon
MacLure expressed his opinion of Milton, both from a theological and
social standpoint, with such vigor and frankness that an attentive
audience of Drumtochty men could hardly contain themselves.Jamie Soutar
was selling his pig at the time, and missed the meeting, but he hastened
to condole with Milton, who was complaining everywhere of the doctor's
language.[Illustration]

"Ye did richt tae resist him; it 'ill maybe roose the Glen tae mak a
stand; he fair hands them in bondage."Thirty shillings for twal veesits, and him no mair than seeven mile
awa, an' a'm telt there werena mair than four at nicht."Ye 'ill hae the sympathy o' the Glen, for a' body kens yir as free wi'
yir siller as yir tracts."Wes't 'Beware o' gude warks' ye offered him?Man, ye choose it weel,
for he's been colleckin' sae mony thae forty years, a'm feared for him."A've often thocht oor doctor's little better than the Gude Samaritan,
an' the Pharisees didna think muckle o' his chance aither in this warld
or that which is tae come."It was an odd sight to see them on their nests or perched upon a limb,
chattering and scolding as approached."In the trees I had no difficulty in finding full sets of their eggs,
as the egg collectors rarely take the trouble to climb, but on the
rocks I was unable to find an egg within reach, the 'eggers' going
daily over the rocks.I was told by several that they yearly robbed the
birds, taking, however, but nine eggs from a nest, as they found that
whenever they took a greater number, the birds so robbed would forsake
their nests, or, as they expressed it, cease to lay, and that in order
to prevent an over-collection they invariably drop near the nest a
little stone or pebble for every egg taken."They do not leave their nesting grounds
until able to fly, though, half-grown birds are sometimes seen on the
water that by fright or accident have fallen.The nests are composed
of grass and moss.Some of them are large and elaborately made, while
others are merely shallow depressions with a slight lining.Three eggs
are usually laid, which vary from bluish-white to a deep yellowish
brown, spotted and blotched with brown of different shades.In many
cases where the Herring Gull has suffered persecution, it has been
known to depart from its usual habit of nesting on the open seashore.It is a pleasure to watch a flock of Gulls riding buoyantly upon the
water.They do not dive, as many suppose, but only immerse the head
and neck.They are omnivorous and greedy eaters; "scavengers of the
beach, and in the harbors to be seen boldly alighting upon the masts
and flying about the vessels, picking up the refuse matter as soon as
it is cast overboard, and often following the steamers from thirty
to forty miles from the land, and sometimes much farther."They are
ever upon the alert, with a quick eye that notices every floating
object or disturbance of the water, and as they herald with screams
the appearance of the Herring or other small fishes that often swim in
schools at the surface of the water, they prove an unerring pilot to
the fishermen who hastily follow with their lines and nets, for they
know that beneath and following the valuable catch in sight are the
larger fishes that are so intent upon taking the little ones in out of
the wet as largely to forget their cunning, and thus make their capture
an easy one.Very large flocks of Gulls, at times appearing many hundreds, are
seen on Lake Michigan.We recently saw in the vicinity of Milwaukee
a flock of what we considered to be many thousands of these birds,
flying swiftly, mounting up, and falling, as if to catch themselves,
in wide circles, the sun causing their wings and sides to glisten like
burnished silver.It is claimed that two hundred millions of dollars that should go to
the farmer, the gardner, and the fruit grower in the United States are
lost every year by the ravages of insects--that is to say, one-tenth of
our agricultural product is actually destroyed by them.The Department
of Agriculture has made a thorough investigation of this subject, and
its conclusions are about as stated.The ravages of the Gypsy Moth in
three counties in Massachusetts for several years annually cost the
state $100,000."Now, as rain is the natural check to drought, so birds
are the natural check to insects, for what are pests to the farmer
are necessities of life to the bird.It is calculated that an average
insectivorous bird destroys 2,400 insects in a year; and when it is
remembered that there are over 100,000 kinds of insects in the United
States, the majority of which are injurious, and that in some cases
a single individual in a year may become the progenitor of several
billion descendants, it is seen how much good birds do ordinarily
by simple prevention."All of which has reference chiefly to the
indispensableness of preventing by every possible means the destruction
of the birds whose food largely consists of insects.But many of our so-called birds of prey, which have been thought to
be the enemies of the agriculturist and have hence been ruthlessly
destroyed, are equally beneficial.Fisher, an authority on the
subject, in referring to the injustice which has been done to many of
the best friends of the farm and garden, says:

"The birds of prey, the majority of which labor night and day to
destroy the enemies of the husbandman, are persecuted unceasingly.This
has especially been the case with the Hawk family, only three of the
common inland species being harmful.These are the Goshawk, Cooper's
Hawk, and the Sharp-shinned Hawk, the first of which is rare in the
United States, except in winter.Cooper's Hawk, or the Chicken Hawk,
is the most destructive, especially to Doves.The other Hawks are of
great value, one of which, the Marsh Hawk, being regarded as perhaps
more useful than any other.It can be easily distinguished by its
white rump and its habit of beating low over the meadows.Meadow Mice,
Rabbits, and Squirrels are its favorite food.The Red-tailed Hawk, or
Hen Hawk, is another."It does not deserve the name, for according to
Dr.Fisher, while fully sixty-six per cent of its food consists of
injurious mammals, not more than seven per cent consists of poultry,
and that it is probable that a large proportion of the poultry and game
captured by it and the other Buzzard Hawks is made up of old, diseased,
or otherwise disabled fowls, so preventing their interbreeding with the
sound stock and hindering the spread of fatal epidemics.It eats Ground
Squirrels, Rabbits, Mice, and Rats.The Red-shouldered Hawk, whose picture we present to our readers, is
as useful as it is beautiful, in fact ninety per cent of its food is
composed of injurious mammals and insects.The Sparrow Hawk (See BIRDS, vol.107) is another useful member
of this family.In the warm months Grasshoppers, Crickets, and other
insects compose its food, and Mice during the rest of the year.Swainson's Hawk is said to be the great Grasshopper destroyer of the
west, and it is estimated that in a month three hundred of these birds
save sixty tons of produce that the Grasshopper would destroy.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.On account of the value of its skin, this interesting animal is much
sought after by those who take pride in their skill in securing it.It is commonly known by its abbreviated name of <DW53>, and as it is of
frequent occurrence throughout the United States, every country boy is
more or less acquainted with its habits.As an article of food there is
much diversity of opinion respecting its merits.It is hunted by some
for the sport alone, which is doubtless to be lamented, and by others
who enjoy also the pleasure of a palatable stew.As a pet it is also
much prized.The food of the Raccoon consists in the main of small animals and
insects.The succulent Oyster also is a favorite article of its diet.It bites off the hinge of the Oyster and scrapes out the animal in
fragments with its paws.Like the Squirrel when eating a nut, the
Raccoon usually holds its food between its fore paws pressed together
and sits upon its hind quarters when it eats.Poultry is also enjoyed
by it, and it is said to be as destructive in the farm yard as the Fox,
as it only devours the heads of the fowl.When taken young the <DW53> is easily tamed, but often becomes blind soon
after its capture.This is believed to be produced by the sensitiveness
of its eyes, which are intended only to be used by night.As it is
frequently awakened by day it suffers so much from the glare of light
that its eyes gradually lose their vision.If it must be confined
at all it should be in a darkened place.In zoological gardens we
have frequently seen several of these animals exposed to the glaring
sunlight, the result of ignorance or cruelty, or both.Unlike the Fox, the Raccoon is at home in a tree, which is the usual
refuge when danger is near, and not being very swift of foot, it is
well that it possesses this climbing ability.According to Hallock,
the <DW53>s' abode is generally in a hollow tree, oak or chestnut, and
when the "juvenile farmer's son comes across a _Coon tree_, he is
not long in making known his discovery to friends and neighbors, who
forthwith assemble at the spot to secure it."The "sport" is in no
sense agreeable from a humane point of view, and we trust it will cease
to be regarded as such by those who indulge in it."The Raccoon makes a
heroic struggle and often puts many of his assailants _hors de combat_
for many a day, his jaws being strong and his claws sharp."The young ones are generally from four to eight, pretty little
creatures at first and about as large as half-grown Rats.They are very
playful, soon become docile and tame, but at the first chance will
wander off to the woods and not return.The <DW53> is a night animal and
never travels by day; sometimes it is said, being caught at morning far
from its tree and being unable to return thither, it will spend the
hours of daylight snugly coiled up among the thickest foliage of some
lofty tree-top.It is adroit in its attempts to baffle Dogs, and will
often enter a brook and travel for some distance in the water, thus
puzzling and delaying its pursuers.A good sized Raccoon will weigh from fifteen to twenty pounds.The curiosity of the Raccoon is one of its most interesting
characteristics.It will search every place of possible concealment for
food, examine critically any object of interest, will rifle a pocket,
stand upright and watch every motion of man or animal, and indeed show
a marked desire for all sorts of knowledge.Raccoons are apparently
happy in captivity when properly cared for by their keepers.Their Number and Variety is Increasing Instead of Diminishing.Whether in consequence of the effective working of the Wild Birds'
Charter or of other unknown causes, there can be no doubt in the
minds of observant lovers of our feathered friends that of late years
there has been a great and gratifying increase in their numbers in
and around London, especially so, of course, in the vicinity of the
beautiful open spaces which do such beneficent work silently in this
province of houses.But even in long, unlovely streets, far removed
from the rich greenery of the parks, the shabby parallelograms, by
courtesy styled gardens, are becoming more and more frequently visited
by such pretty shy songsters as Linnets, Blackbirds, Thrushes, and
Finches, who, though all too often falling victims to the predatory
Cat, find abundant food in these cramped enclosures.Naturally some
suburbs are more favored than others in this respect, notably Dulwich,
which, though fast losing its beautiful character under the ruthless
grip of the builder, still retains some delightful nooks where one may
occasionally hear the Nightingale's lovely song in its season.But the most noticable additions to the bird population of London have
been among the Starlings.Their quaint gabble and peculiar minor
whistle may now be heard in the most unexpected localities.Sandra moved to the kitchen.Even
the towering mansions which have replaced so many of the slums of
Westminster find favor in their eyes, for among the thick clustering
chimneys which crown these great buildings their slovenly nests may be
found in large numbers.In some districts they are so numerous that the
irrepressible Sparrow, true London gamin that he is, finds himself in
considerable danger of being crowded out.This is perhaps most evident
on the sequestered lawns of some of the inns of the court, Gray's Inn
Square, for instance, where hundreds of Starlings at a time may now
be observed busily trotting about the greensward searching for food.Several long streets come to mind where not a house is without its pair
or more of Starlings, who continue faithful to their chosen roofs, and
whose descendants settle near as they grow up, well content with their
surroundings.House Martins, too, in spite of repeated efforts on the
part of irritated landlords to drive them away by destroying their
nests on account of the disfigurement to the front of the dwelling,
persist in returning year after year and rebuilding their ingenious
little mud cells under the eaves of the most modern suburban villas or
terrace houses.--_Pall Mall Gazette._




  [Illustration: From col.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.The Pigmy Antelopes present examples of singular members of the family,
in that they are of exceedingly diminutive size, the smallest being
no larger than a large Rat, dainty creatures indeed.The Pigmy is an
inhabitant of South Africa, and its habits are said to be quite similar
to those of its brother of the western portion of North America.The Antelope is a very wary animal, but the sentiment of curiosity
is implanted so strongly in its nature that it often leads it to
reconnoitre too closely some object which it cannot clearly make out,
and its investigations are pursued until "the dire answer to all
inquiries is given by the sharp'spang' of the rifle and the answering
'spat' as the ball strikes the beautiful creatures flank."The Pigmy
Antelope is not hunted, however, as is its larger congener, and may
be considered rather as a diminutive curiosity of Natures' delicate
workmanship than as the legitimate prey of man.No sooner had the twilight settled over the island than new bird voices
called from the hills about us.The birds of the day were at rest, and
their place was filled with the night denizens of the island.They
came from the dark recesses of the forests, first single stragglers,
increased by midnight to a stream of eager birds, passing to and fro
from the sea.Many, attracted by the glow of the burning logs, altered
their course and circled about the fire a few times and then sped on.From their notes we identified the principal night prowlers as the
Cassin's Auklet, Rhinoceros Auk, Murrelet, and varieties of Petrel.All through the night our slumbers were frequently disturbed by birds
alighting on the sides of the tent, slipping down with great scratching
into the grass below, where our excited Dog took a hand in the matter,
daylight often finding our tent strewn with birds he had captured
during the night.When he found time to sleep I do not know.He was
after birds the entire twenty-four hours.In climbing over the hills of the island we discovered the retreats of
these night birds, the soil everywhere through the deep wood being
fairly honeycombed with their nesting burrows.The larger tunnels
of the Rhinoceros Auks were, as a rule, on the <DW72>s of the hill,
while the little burrows of the Cassin's Auklet were on top in the
flat places.We opened many of their queer abodes that ran back with
many turns to a distance of ten feet or more.One or both birds were
invariably found at the end, covering their single egg, for this
species, like many other sea birds, divide the duties of incubation,
both sexes doing an equal share, relieving each other at night.The Puffins nested in burrows also, but lower down--often just above
the surf.One must be very careful, indeed, how he thrusts his hand
into their dark dens, for should the old bird chance to be at home, its
vise-like bill can inflict a very painful wound.The rookeries of the
Murres and Cormorants were on the sides of steep cliffs overhanging the
sea.Looking down from above, hundreds of eggs could be seen, gathered
along the narrow shelves and chinks in the rocks, but accessible only
by means of a rope from the top.--_Outing._




THE RED-SHOULDERED HAWK.Blue Jay
imitated, as you will remember, in the story "The New Tenants,"
published in Birds._Kee-oe_, _kee-oe_, _kee-oe_, that is my cry, very loud and plaintive;
they say I am a very noisy bird; perhaps that is the reason why Mr.Blue Jay imitates me more than he does other Hawks.I am called Chicken Hawk, and Hen Hawk, also, though I don't deserve
either of those names.There are members of our family, and oh, what
a lot of us there are--as numerous as the Woodpeckers--who do drop
down into the barnyards and right before the farmer's eyes carry off
a Chicken.Red Squirrels, to my notion, are more appetizing than
Chickens; so are Mice, Frogs, Centipedes, Snakes, and Worms.A bird
once in a while I like for variety, and between you and me, if I am
hungry, I pick up a chicken now and then, that has strayed outside the
barnyard.But only _occasionally_, remember, so that I don't deserve
the name of Chicken Hawk at all, do I?Wooded swamps, groves inhabited by Squirrels, and patches of low timber
are the places in which we make our homes.Sometimes we use an old
crow's nest instead of building one; we retouch it a little and put in
a soft lining of feathers which my mate plucks from her breast.When
we build a new nest, it is made of husks, moss, and strips of bark,
lined as the building progresses with my mate's feathers.Young lady
Red-shouldered Hawks lay three and sometimes four eggs, but the old
lady birds lay only two.Blue Jay never sees a Hawk without giving the alarm, and on
he rushes to attack us, backed up by other Jays who never fail to go
to his assistance.They often assemble in great numbers and actually
succeed in driving us out of the neighborhood.Not that we are afraid
of them, oh no!We know them to be great cowards, as well as the crows,
who harass us also, and only have to turn on our foes to put them to
rout.Sometimes we do turn, and seizing a Blue Jay, sail off with him
to the nearest covert; or in mid air strike a Crow who persistently
follows us.But as a general thing we simply ignore our little
assailants, and just fly off to avoid them.RED-SHOULDERED HAWK.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.The Hawk family is an interesting one and many of them are beautiful.The Red-shouldered Hawk is one of the finest specimens of these birds,
as well as one of the most useful.Of late years the farmer has come to
know it as his friend rather than his enemy, as formerly.It inhabits
the woodlands where it feeds chiefly upon Squirrels, Rabbits, Mice,
Moles, and Lizards.It occasionally drops down on an unlucky Duck or
Bob White, though it is not quick enough to catch the smaller birds.It is said to be destructive to domestic fowls raised in or near the
timber, but does not appear to search for food far away from its
natural haunts.As it is a very noisy bird, the birds which it might
destroy are warned of its approach, and thus protect themselves.During the early nesting season its loud, harsh _kee-oe_ is heard from
the perch and while in the air, often keeping up the cry for a long
time without intermission.Goss says that he collected at Neosho
Falls, Kansas, for several successive years a set of the eggs of this
species from a nest in the forks of a medium sized oak.In about nine
days after each robbery the birds would commence laying again, and
he allowed them to hatch and rear their young.One winter during his
absence the tree was cut down, but this did not discourage the birds,
or cause them to forsake the place, for on approach of spring he found
them building a nest not over ten rods from the old one, but this time
in a large sycamore beyond reach.This seemed to him to indicate that
they become greatly attached to the grounds selected for a home, which
they vigilantly guard, not permitting a bird of prey to come within
their limits.This species is one of the commonest in the United States, being
especially abundant in the winter, from which it receives the name of
Winter Falcon.The name of Chicken Hawk is often applied to it, though
it does not deserve the name, its diet being of a more humble kind.The eggs are usually deposited in April or May in numbers of three or
four--sometimes only two.The ground color is bluish, yellowish-white
or brownish, spotted, blotched and dotted irregularly with many shades
of reddish brown.According to
Davie, to describe all the shades of reds and browns which comprise the
variation would be an almost endless task, and a large series like this
must be seen in order to appreciate how much the eggs of this species
vary.The flight of the Red-shouldered Hawk is slow, but steady and strong
with a regular beat of the wings.They take delight in sailing in the
air, where they float lightly and with scarcely a notable motion of
the wings, often circling to a great height.During the insect season,
while thus sailing, they often fill their craws with grass-hoppers,
that, during the after part of the day, also enjoy an air sail.Venice, the pride of Italy of old, aside from its other numerous
curiosities and antiquities, has one which is a novelty indeed.Its
Doves on the San Marco Place are a source of wonder and amusement to
every lover of animal life.Their most striking peculiarity is that
they fear no mortal man, be he stranger or not.They come in countless
numbers, and, when not perched on the far-famed bell tower, are found
on the flags of San Marco Square.They are often misnamed Pigeons, but
as a matter of fact they are Doves of the highest order.They differ,
however, from our wild Doves in that they are fully three times as
large, and twice as large as our best domestic Pigeon.Their plumage
is of a soft mouse color relieved by pure white, and occasionally
one of pure white is found, but these are rare.Hold out to them a
handful of crumbs and without fear they will come, perch on your hand
or shoulder and eat with thankful coos.To strangers this is indeed
a pleasing sight, and demonstrates the lack of fear of animals when
they are treated humanely, for none would dare to injure the doves of
San Marco.He would probably forfeit his life were he to injure one
intentionally.And what beggars these Doves of San Marco are!They will
crowd around, and push and coo with their soft soothing voices, until
you can withstand them no longer, and invest a few centimes in bread
for their benefit.Their bread, by the way, is sold by an Italian, who
must certainly be in collusion with the Doves, for whenever a stranger
makes his appearance, both Doves and bread vender are at hand to beg.The most remarkable fact in connection with these Doves is that they
will collect in no other place in large numbers than San Marco Square,
and in particular at the vestibule of San Marco Church.True, they are
found perched on buildings throughout the entire city, and occasionally
we will find a few in various streets picking refuse, but they never
appear in great numbers outside of San Marco Square.The ancient bell
tower, which is situated on the west side of the place, is a favorite
roosting place for them, and on this perch they patiently wait for a
foreigner, and proceed to bleed him after approved Italian fashion.There are several legends connected with the Doves of Venice, each of
which attempts to explain the peculiar veneration of the Venetian and
the extreme liberty allowed these harbingers of peace.The one which
struck me as being the most appropriate is as follows:

Centuries ago Venice was a free city, having her own government, navy,
and army, and in a manner was considered quite a power on land and sea.The city was ruled by a Senate consisting of ten men, who were called
Doges, who had absolute power, which they used very often in a despotic
and cruel manner, especially where political prisoners were concerned.On account of the riches the city contained, and also its values as
a port, Venice was coveted by Italy and neighboring nations, and, as
a consequence, was often called upon to defend itself with rather
indifferent success.In fact, Venice was conquered so often, first by
one and then another, that Venetians were seldom certain of how they
stood.They knew not whether they were slave or victor.It was during
one of these sieges that the incident of the Doves occurred.The city
had been besieged for a long time by Italians, and matters were coming
to such a pass that a surrender was absolutely necessary on account of
lack of food.In fact, the Doges had issued a decree that on the morrow
the city should surrender unconditionally.All was gloom and sorrow, and the populace stood around in groups
on the San Marco discussing the situation and bewailing their fate,
when lo!in the eastern sky there appeared a dense cloud rushing upon
the city with the speed of the wind.At first consternation reigned
supreme, and men asked each other: "What new calamity is this?"As the
cloud swiftly approached it was seen to be a vast number of Doves,
which, after hovering over the San Marco Place for a moment, gracefully
settled down upon the flagstones and approached the men without fear.Then there arose a queer cry, "The Doves!It
appears that some years before this a sage had predicted stormy times
for Venice, with much suffering and strife, but, when all seemed lost,
there would appear a multitude of Doves, who would bring Venice peace
and happiness.And so it came to pass that the next day, instead of
attacking, the besiegers left, and Venice was free again.The prophet
also stated that, so long as the Doves remained at Venice prosperity
would reign supreme, but that there would come a day when the Doves
would leave just as they had come, and Venice would pass into
oblivion.That is why Venetians take such good care of their Doves.You will not find this legend in any history, but I give it just as it
was told me by a guide, who seemed well versed in hair-raising legends.Possibly they were manufactured to order by this energetic gentleman,
but they sounded well nevertheless.Even to this day the old men of
Venice fear that some morning they will awake and find their Doves gone.There in the shadow of the famous bell-tower, with the stately San
Marco church on one side and the palace of the cruel and murderous
Doges on the other, we daily find our pretty Doves coaxing for bread.Often you will find them peering down into the dark passage-way in the
palace, which leads to the dungeons underneath the Grand Canal.What
a boon a sight of these messengers of peace would have been to the
doomed inmates of these murder-reeking caves.But happily they are now
deserted, and are used only as a source of revenue, which is paid by
the inquisitive tourist.She never changes, and the Doves of San
Marco will still remain.May we hope, with the sages of Venice, that
they may remain forever.--_Lebert, in Cincinnati Commercial Gazette._




BUTTERFLIES.It may appear strange, if not altogether inappropriate to the season,
that "the fair fragile things which are the resurrection of the ugly,
creeping caterpillars" should be almost as numerous in October as in
the balmy month of July.Yet it is true, and early October, in some
parts of the country, is said to be perhaps the best time of the year
for the investigating student and observer of Butterflies.While not
quite so numerous, perhaps, many of the species are in more perfect
condition, and the variety is still intact.Many of them come and
remain until frost, and the largest Butterfly we have, the Archippus,
does not appear until the middle of July, but after that is constantly
with us, floating and circling on the wing, until October.How these
delicate creatures can endure even the chill of autumn days is one of
the mysteries.Very curious and interesting are the Skippers, says _Current
Literature_.They are very small insects, but their bodies are robust,
and they fly with great rapidity, not moving in graceful, wavy lines
as the true Butterflies do, but skipping about with sudden, jerky
motions.Their flight is very short, and almost always near the
ground.They can never be mistaken, as their peculiar motion renders
their identification easy.They are seen at their best in August and
September.All June and July Butterflies are August and September
Butterflies, not so numerous in some instances, perhaps, but still
plentiful, and vying with the rich hues of the changing autumnal
foliage.The "little wood brownies," or Quakers, are exceedingly interesting.Their colors are not brilliant, but plain, and they seek the quiet and
retirement of the woods, where they flit about in graceful circles over
the shady beds of ferns and woodland grasses.Many varieties of the Vanessa are often seen flying about in May, but
they are far more numerous and perfect in July, August, and September.A beautiful Azure-blue Butterfly, when it is fluttering over flowers
in the sunshine, looks like a tiny speck of bright blue satin.Several
other small Butterflies which appear at the same time are readily
distinguished by the peculiar manner in which their hind wings are
tailed.Their color is a dull brown of various shades, marked in some
of the varieties with specks of white or blue."Their presence in the gardens and meadows," says a recent writer,
"and in the fields and along the river-banks, adds another element
of gladness which we are quick to recognize, and even the plodding
wayfarer who has not the honor of a single intimate acquaintance among
them might, perhaps, be the first to miss their circlings about his
path.As roses belong to June, and chrysanthemums to November, so
Butterflies seem to be a joyous part of July.It is their gala-day,
and they are everywhere, darting and circling and sailing, dropping to
investigate flowers and overripe fruit, and rising on buoyant wings
high into the upper air, bright, joyous, airy, ephemeral.But July can
only claim the larger part of their allegiance, for they are wanderers
into all the other months, and even occasionally brave the winter with
torn and faded wings."[Illustration: BUTTERFLIES.--Life-size.Somehow people always say that when they see a Fox.I'd rather they
would call me that than stupid, however."Look pleasant," said the man when taking my photograph for Birds,
and I flatter myself I did--and intelligent, too.Look at my brainy
head, my delicate ears--broad below to catch every sound, and tapering
so sharply to a point that they can shape themselves to every wave
of sound.Note the crafty calculation and foresight of my low, flat
brow, the resolute purpose of my pointed nose; my eye deep set--like
a robber's--my thin cynical lips, and mouth open from ear to ear.You
couldn't find a better looking Fox if you searched the world over.I can leap, crawl, run, and swim, and walk so noiselessly that even the
dead leaves won't rustle under my feet.It takes a deal of cunning for
a Fox to get along in this world, I can tell you.I'd go hungry if I
didn't plan and observe the habits of other creatures.When I want one for my supper off I trot to the nearest
stream, and standing very quiet, watch till I spy a nice, plump trout
in the clear water.A leap, a snap, and it is all over with Mr.Another time I feel as though I'd like a crawfish.I see one snoozing
by his hole near the water's edge.I drop my fine, bushy tail into the
water and tickle him on the ear.That makes him furious--nobody likes
to be wakened from a nap that way--and out he darts at the tail; snap
go my jaws, and Mr.Crawfish is crushed in them, shell and all.Between you and me, I consider that a very clever trick, too.How I love the green fields,
the ripening grain, the delicious fruits, for then the Rabbits prick up
their long ears, and thinking themselves out of danger, run along the
hillside; then the quails skulk in the wheat stubble, and the birds hop
and fly about the whole day long.I am very fond of Rabbits, Quails,
and other Birds.For dessert I have
only to sneak into an orchard and eat my fill of apples, pears, and
grapes.You perceive I have very good reason for liking the summer.It's the merriest time of the year for me, and my cubs.They grow fat
and saucy, too.The only Foxes that are hunted (the others only being taken by means of
traps or poison) are the Red and Gray species.The Gray Fox is a more
southern species than the Red and is rarely found north of the state
of Maine.Indeed it is said to be not common anywhere in New England.In the southern states, however, it wholly replaces the Red Fox, and,
according to Hallock, one of the best authorities on game animals in
this country, causes quite as much annoyance to the farmer as does
that proverbial and predatory animal, the terror of the hen-roost and
the smaller rodents.The Gray Fox is somewhat smaller than the Red and
differs from him in being wholly dark gray "mixed hoary and black."He
also differs from his northern cousin in being able to climb trees.Although not much of a runner, when hard pressed by the dog he will
often ascend the trunk of a leaning tree, or will even climb an erect
one, grasping the trunk in his arms as would a Bear.Nevertheless the
Fox is not at home among the branches, and looks and no doubt feels
very much out of place while in this predicament.The ability to climb,
however, often saves him from the hounds, who are thus thrown off the
scent and Reynard is left to trot home at his leisure.Foxes live in holes of their own making, generally in the loamy soil
of a side hill, says an old Fox hunter, and the she-Fox bears four or
five cubs at a litter.When a fox-hole is discovered by the Farmers
they assemble and proceed to dig out the inmates who have lately, very
likely, been making havoc among the hen-roosts.An amusing incident,
he relates, which came under his observation a few years ago will
bear relating.A farmer discovered the lair of an old dog Fox by
means of his hound, who trailed the animal to his hole.This Fox had
been making large and nightly inroads into the poultry ranks of the
neighborhood, and had acquired great and unenviable notoriety on that
account.The farmer and two companions, armed with spades and hoes,
and accompanied by the faithful hound, started to dig out the Fox.The
hole was situated on the sandy <DW72> of a hill, and after a laborious
and continued digging of four hours, Reynard was unearthed and he and
Rep, the dog, were soon engaged in deadly strife.The excitement had
waxed hot, and dog, men, and Fox were all struggling in a promiscuous
melee.Soon a burly farmer watching his chance strikes wildly with his
hoe-handle for Reynard's head, which is scarcely distinguishable in the
maze of legs and bodies.a sudden movement
of the hairy mass brings the fierce stroke upon the faithful dog, who
with a wild howl relaxes his grasp and rolls with bruised and bleeding
head, faint and powerless on the hillside.Reynard takes advantage of
the turn affairs have assumed, and before the gun, which had been laid
aside on the grass some hours before, can be reached he disappears over
the crest of the hill.Hallock says that an old she-Fox with young, to supply them with food,
will soon deplete the hen-roost and destroy both old and great numbers
of very young chickens.They generally travel by night, follow regular
runs, and are exceedingly shy of any invention for their capture, and
the use of traps is almost futile.If caught in a trap, they will gnaw
off the captured foot and escape, in which respect they fully support
their ancient reputation for cunning.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.RURAL BIRD LIFE IN INDIA.--"Nothing gives more delight," writes Mr.Caine, "in traveling through rural India than the bird-life that
abounds everywhere; absolutely unmolested, they are as tame as a
poultry yard, making the country one vast aviary.Yellow-beaked Minas,
Ring-doves, Jays, Hoopoes, and Parrots take dust baths with the merry
Palm-squirrel in the roadway, hardly troubling themselves to hop out
of the way of the heavy bull-carts; every wayside pond and lake is
alive with Ducks, Wild Geese, Flamingoes, Pelicans, and waders of every
size and sort, from dainty red-legged beauties the size of Pigeons up
to the great unwieldy Cranes and Adjutants five feet high.We pass a
dead Sheep with two loathsome vultures picking over the carcass, and
presently a brood of fluffy young Partridges with father and mother in
charge look at us fearlessly within ten feet of our whirling carriage.Every village has its flock of sacred Peacocks pacing gravely through
the surrounding gardens and fields, and Woodpeckers and Kingfishers
flash about like jewels in the blazing sunlight."----

WARNING COLORS.--Very complete experiments in support of the theory
of warning colors, first suggested by Bates and also by Wallace, have
been made in India by Mr.He concludes
that there is a general appetite for Butterflies among insectivorous
birds, though they are rarely seen when wild to attack them; also that
many, probably most birds, dislike, if not intensely, at any rate
in comparison with other Butterflies, those of the Danais genus and
three other kinds, including a species of Papilio, which is the most
distasteful.The mimics of these Butterflies are relatively palatable.He found that each bird has to separately acquire its experience with
bad-tasting Butterflies, but well remembers what it learns.He also
experimented with Lizards, and noticed that, unlike the birds, they ate
the nauseous as well as other Butterflies.----

INCREASE IN ZOOLOGICAL PRESERVES IN THE UNITED STATES--The
establishment of the National Zoological Park, Washington, has led
to the formation of many other zoological preserves in the United
States.In the western part of New Hampshire is an area of 26,000
acres, established by the late Austin Corbin, and containing 74 Bison,
200 Moose, 1,500 Elk, 1,700 Deer of different species, and 150 Wild
Boar, all of which are rapidly multiplying.In the Adirondacks, a
preserve of 9,000 acres has been stocked with Elk, Virginia Deer,
Muledeer, Rabbits, and Pheasants.The same animals are preserved by W.
C. Whitney on an estate of 1,000 acres in the Berkshire Hills, near
Lenox, Mass., where also he keeps Bison and Antelope.Other preserves
are Nehasane Park, in the Adirondacks, 8,000 acres; Tranquillity Park,
near Allamuchy, N. J., 4,000 acres; the Alling preserve, near Tacoma,
Washington, 5,000 acres; North Lodge, near St.Paul, Minn., 400 acres;
and Furlough Lodge, in the Catskills, N. Y., 600 acres.----

ROBINS ABUNDANT--Not for many years have these birds been so numerous
as during 1898.Once, under some wide-spreading willow trees, where the
ground was bare and soft, we counted about forty Red-breasts feeding
together, and on several occasions during the summer we saw so many in
flocks, that we could only guess at the number.When unmolested, few
birds become so tame and none are more interesting.East of the Missouri River the Gray Squirrel is found almost
everywhere, and is perhaps the most common variety.Wherever there is
timber it is almost sure to be met with, and in many localities is very
abundant, especially where it has had an opportunity to breed without
unusual disturbance.Its usual color is pale gray above and white or
yellowish white beneath, but individuals of the species grade from this
color through all the stages to jet black.Gray and black Squirrels
are often found associating together.They are said to be in every
respect alike, in the anatomy of their bodies, habits, and in every
detail excepting the color, and by many sportsmen they are regarded as
distinct species, and that the black form is merely due to melanism,
an anomaly not uncommon among animals.Whether this be the correct
explanation may well be left to further scientific observation.Like all the family, the Gray Squirrels feed in the early morning
just after sunrise and remain during the middle of the day in their
hole or nest.It is in the early morning or the late afternoon, when
they again appear in search of the evening meal, that the wise hunter
lies in wait for them.Then they may be heard and seen playing and
chattering together till twilight.Sitting upright and motionless
on a log the intruder will rarely be discovered by them, but at the
slightest movement they scamper away, hardly to return.This fact is
taken advantage of by the sportsmen, and, says an observer, be he
at all familiar with the runways of the Squirrels at any particular
locality he may sit by the path and bag a goodly number.Gray and Black
Squirrels generally breed twice during the spring and summer, and have
several young at a litter.We have been told that an incident of migration of Squirrels of a very
remarkable kind occurred a good many years ago, caused by lack of mast
and other food, in New York State.When the creatures arrived at the
Niagara river, their apparent destination being Canada, they seemed
to hesitate before attempting to cross the swift running stream.The
current is very rapid, exceeding seven miles an hour.They finally
ventured in the water, however, and with tails spread for sails,
succeeded in making the opposite shore, but more than a mile below the
point of entrance.They are better swimmers than one would fancy them
to be, as they have much strength and endurance.We remember when a
boy seeing some mischievous urchins repeatedly throw a tame Squirrel
into deep water for the cruel pleasure of watching it swim ashore.The
"sport" was soon stopped, however, by a passerby, who administered a
rebuke that could hardly be forgotten.Squirrels are frequently domesticated and become as tame as any
household tabby.Unfortunately Dogs and Cats seem to show a relentless
enmity toward them, as they do toward all rodents.The Squirrel is
willing to be friendly, and no doubt would gladly affiliate with
them, but the instinct of the canine and the feline impels them to
exterminate it.We once gave shelter and food to a strange Cat and
was rewarded by seeing it fiercely attack and kill a beautiful white
Rabbit which until then had had the run of the yard and never before
been molested.Until we shall be able to teach the beasts of the field
something of our sentimental humanitarianism we can scarcely expect to
see examples of cruelty wholly disappear.I killed a Robin--the little thing,
    With scarlet breast on a glossy wing,
      That comes in the apple tree to sing.I flung a stone as he twittered there,
      I only meant to give him a scare,
      But off it went--and hit him square.A little flutter--a little cry--
      Then on the ground I saw him lie.I didn't think he was going to die.But as I watched him I soon could see
      He never would sing for you or me
      Any more in the apple tree.Never more in the morning light,
      Never more in the sunshine bright,
      Trilling his song in gay delight.And I'm thinking, every summer day,
      How never, never, I can repay
      The little life that I took away.--SYDNEY DAYRE, in The Youth's Companion.THE PECTORAL SANDPIPER.More than a score of Sandpipers are described in the various works
on ornithology.The one presented here, however, is perhaps the most
curious specimen, distributed throughout North, Central, and South
America, breeding in the Arctic regions.It is also of frequent
occurrence in Europe.Low, wet lands, muddy flats, and the edges
of shallow pools of water are its favorite resorts.The birds move
in flocks, but, while feeding, scatter as they move about, picking
and probing here and there for their food, which consists of worms,
insects, small shell fish, tender rootlets, and birds; "but at the
report of a gun," says Col.Goss, "or any sudden fright, spring into
the air, utter a low whistling note, quickly bunch together, flying
swift and strong, usually in a zigzag manner, and when not much hunted
often circle and drop back within shot; for they are not naturally
a timid or suspicious bird, and when quietly and slowly approached,
sometimes try to hide by squatting close to the ground."Of the Pectoral Sandpiper's nesting habits, little has been known until
recently.Nelson's interesting description, in his report upon
"Natural History Collections in Alaska," we quote as follows: "The
night of May 24, 1889, I lay wrapped in my blanket, and from the raised
flap of the tent looked out over as dreary a cloud-covered landscape as
can be imagined.As my eyelids began to droop and the scene to become
indistinct, suddenly a low, hollow, booming note struck my ear and
sent my thoughts back to a spring morning in northern Illinois, and
to the loud vibrating tones of the Prairie Chickens.[See BIRDS AND
ALL NATURE, Vol.Again the sound arose, nearer and more
distinct, and with an effort I brought myself back to the reality of my
position, and, resting upon one elbow, listened.A few seconds passed,
and again arose the note; a moment later I stood outside the tent.The
open flat extended away on all sides, with apparently not a living
creature near.Once again the note was repeated close by, and a glance
revealed its author.Standing in the thin grass ten or fifteen yards
from me, with its throat inflated until it was as large as the rest of
the bird, was a male Pectoral Sandpiper.The succeeding days afforded
opportunity to observe the bird as it uttered its singular notes, under
a variety of situations, and at various hours of the day, or during the
light Arctic night.The note is deep, hollow, and resonant, but at the
same time liquid and musical, and may be represented by a repetition of
the syllables _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_."The bird
may frequently be seen running along the ground close to the female,
its enormous sac inflated.Murdock says the birds breed in abundance at Point Barrow, Alaska,
and that the nest is always built in the grass, with a preference for
high and dry localities.The nest was like that of the other waders, a
depression in the ground, lined with a little dry grass.The eggs are
four, of pale purplish-gray and light neutral tint.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.Why was the sight
    To such a tender ball as th' eye confined,
    So obvious and so easy to be quenched,
    And not, as feeling, through all parts diffused;
    That she might look at will through every pore?--MILTON."But bein' only eyes, you see, my wision's limited."The reason we know anything at all is that various forms of vibration
are capable of affecting our organs of sense.These agitate the brain,
the mind perceives, and from perception arise the higher forms of
thought.Perhaps the most important of the senses is sight.It ranges
in power from the mere ability to perceive the difference between light
and darkness up to a marvelous means of knowing the nature of objects
of various forms and sizes, at both near and remote range.One the simplest forms of eyes is found in the Sea-anemone.It has a
 mass of pigment cells and refractive bodies that break up the
light which falls upon them, and it is able to know day and night.An examination of this simple organ leads one to think the scientist
not far wrong who claimed that the eye is a development from what was
once merely a particular sore spot that was sensitive to the action
of light.The protophyte, _Euglena varidis_, has what seems to be the
least complicated of all sense organs in the transparent spot in the
front of its body.We know that rays of light have power to alter the color of certain
substances.The retina of the eye is changed in color by exposure to
continued rays of light.Frogs in whose eyes the color of the retina
has apparently been all changed by sunshine are still able to take a
fly accurately and to recognize certain colors.Whether the changes produced by light upon the retina are all chemical
or all physical or partly both remains open to discussion.An interesting experiment was performed by Professor Tyndall proving
that heat rays do not affect the eye optically.He was operating along
the line of testing the power of the eye to transmit to the sensorium
the presence of certain forms of radiant energy.It is well known that
certain waves are unnoticed by the eye but are registered distinctly
by the photographic plate, and he first showed beyond doubt that heat
waves as such have no effect upon the retina.By separating the light
and heat rays from an electric lantern and focusing the latter, he
brought their combined energy to play where his own eye could be placed
directly in contact with them, first protecting the exterior of his
eye from the heat rays.There was no sensation whatever as a result,
but when, directly afterward, he placed a sheet of platinum at the
convergence of the dark rays it quickly became red hot with the energy
which his eye was unable to recognize.The eye is a camera obscura with a very imperfect lens and a receiving
plate irregularly sensitized; but it has marvelous powers of quick
adjustment.The habits of the animal determine the character of the
eye.Birds of rapid flight and those which scan the earth minutely
from lofty courses are able to adjust their vision quickly to long and
short range.The eye of the Owl is subject to his will as he swings
noiselessly down upon the Mouse in the grass.The nearer the object the
more the eye is protruded and the deeper its form from front to rear.The human eye adjusts its power well for small objects within a few
inches and readily reaches out for those several miles away.A curious
feature is that we are able to adjust the eye for something at long
range in less time than for something close at hand.If we are reading
and someone calls our attention to an object on the distant hillside,
the eye adjusts itself to the distance in less than a second, but when
we return our vision to the printed page several seconds are consumed
in the re-adjustment.The Condor of the Andes has great powers of sight.He wheels in
beautiful curves high in the air scrutinizing the ground most carefully
and all the time apparently keeping track of all the other Condors
within a range of several miles.No sooner does one of his kind descend
to the earth than those near him shoot for the same spot hoping the
find may be large enough for a dinner party.Others soaring at greater
distances note their departure and follow in great numbers so that when
the carcass discovered by one Condor proves to be a large one, hundreds
of these huge birds congregate to enjoy the feast.The Condor's
eyes have been well compared to opera glasses, their extension and
contraction are so great.The Eagle soars towards the sun with fixed gaze and apparent fullness
of enjoyment.This would ruin his sight were it not for the fact
that he and all other birds are provided with an extra inner eyelid
called the nictitating membrane which may be drawn at will over the
eye to protect it from too strong a light.Cuvier made the discovery
that the eye of the Eagle, which had up to his time been supposed of
peculiarly great strength to enable it to feast upon the sun's rays, is
closed during its great flights just as the eye of the barnyard fowl
is occasionally rested by the use of this delicate semi-transparent
membrane.Several of the mammals, among them being the horse, are
equipped with such an inner eyelid.One of my most striking experiences on the ocean was had when I pulled
in my first Flounder and found both of his eyes on the same side of
his head.On the side which
glides over the bottom of the sea, the Halibut, Turbot, Plaice, and
Sole are almost white, the upper side being dark enough to be scarcely
distinguishable from the ground.On the upper side are the two eyes,
while the lower side is blind.When first born the fish swims upright with a slight tendency to favor
one side; its eyes are on opposite sides of the head, as in most
vertebrates and the head itself is regular.With age and experience in
exploring the bottom on one side, the under eye refuses to remain away
from the light and gradually turns upward, bringing with it the bones
of the skull to such an extent that the adult Flat-fish becomes the
apparently deformed creature that appears in our markets as a regular
product of the deep.The eyeless inhabitant of the streams in Mammoth Cave presents a
curious instance of the total loss of a sense which remains unused.These little fishes are not only without sight but are also almost
destitute of color and markings, the general appearance being much like
that of a fish with the skin taken off for the frying pan.The eyes of fishes generally are so nearly round that they may be used
with good effect as simple microscopes and have considerable magnifying
power.Being continually washed with the element in which they move,
they have no need for winking and the lachrymal duct which supplies
tears to the eyes of most of the animal kingdom is entirely wanting.Whales have no tear glands in their eyes, and the whole order of
Cetacea are tearless.Among domestic animals there is considerable variety of structure in
the eye.The pupil is usually round, but in the small Cats it is long
vertically, and in the Sheep, in fact, in all the cud chewers and many
other grass eaters, the pupil is long horizontally.Insects present a wonderful array of eyes.These are not movable, but
the evident purpose is that there shall be an eye in readiness in
whatever direction the insect may have business.The common Ant has
fifty six-cornered jewels set advantageously in his little head and
so arranged as to take in everything that pertains to the pleasure of
the industrious little creature.As the Ant does not move about with
great rapidity he is less in need of many eyes than the House-fly which
calls into play four thousand brilliant facets, while the Butterfly
is supplied with about seventeen thousand.The most remarkable of all
is the blundering Beetle which bangs his head against the wall with
twenty-five thousand eyes wide open.Then as a nimble Squirrel from the wood
      Ranging the hedges for his filbert food
      Sits pertly on a bough, his brown nuts cracking
      And from the shell the sweet white kernel taking;
    Till with their crooks and bags a sort of boys
    To share with him come with so great a noise
    That he is forced to leave a nut nigh broke,
    And for his life leap to a neighbor oak,
    Thence to a beech, thence to a row of ashes;
    Whilst through the quagmires and red water plashes
    The boys run dabbing through thick and thin.One tears his hose, another breaks his shin;
    This, torn and tattered, hath with much ado
    Got by the briars; and that hath lost his shoe;
    This drops his band; that headlong falls for haste;
    Another cries behind for being last;
    With sticks and stones and many a sounding holloa
    The little fool with no small sport they follow,
    Whilst he from tree to tree, from spray to spray
    Gets to the woods and hides him in his dray.--WILLIAM BROWNE,

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Birds and all Nature, Vol."I wouldn't feel badly," continued Mrs.He meant to do a good deal, but you mustn't think of that now.It's all over, and it can't be helped, you know."She paused again, and still Jennie remained motionless and mute.Gerhardt, seeing how useless her words were, concluded that
Jennie wished to be alone, and she went away.Still Jennie stood there, and now, as the real significance of the
news began to formulate itself into consecutive thought, she began to
realize the wretchedness of her position, its helplessness.She went
into her bedroom and sat down upon the side of the bed, from which
position she saw a very pale, distraught face staring at her from out
of the small mirror.She looked at it uncertainly; could that really
be her own countenance?"I'll have to go away," she thought, and
began, with the courage of despair, to wonder what refuge would be
open to her.In the mean time the evening meal was announced, and, to maintain
appearances, she went out and joined the family; the naturalness of
her part was very difficult to sustain.Gerhardt observed her subdued
condition without guessing the depth of emotion which it covered.Bass
was too much interested in his own affairs to pay particular attention
to anybody.During the days that followed Jennie pondered over the difficulties
of her position and wondered what she should do.Money she had, it was
true; but no friends, no experience, no place to go.She began to feel unaccountable sinkings of
spirit, nameless and formless fears seemed to surround and haunt her.Once when she arose in the morning she felt an uncontrollable desire
to cry, and frequently thereafter this feeling would seize upon her at
the most inopportune times.Gerhardt began to note her moods, and
one afternoon she resolved to question her daughter."Now you must tell me what's the matter with you," she said
quietly."Jennie, you must tell your mother everything."Jennie, to whom confession had seemed impossible, under the
sympathetic persistence of her mother broke down at last and made the
fatal confession.Gerhardt stood there, too dumb with misery to
give vent to a word.she said at last, a great wave of self-accusation sweeping
over her, "it is all my fault.After a time she went back to the washing she had to do, and stood
over her tub rubbing and crying.The tears ran down her cheeks and
dropped into the suds.Once in a while she stopped and tried to dry
her eyes with her apron, but they soon filled again.Now that the first shock had passed, there came the vivid
consciousness of ever-present danger.What would Gerhardt do if he
learned the truth?He had often said that if ever one of his daughters
should act like some of those he knew he would turn her out of doors."I'm so afraid of your father," Mrs.Gerhardt often said to Jennie
in this intermediate period."I don't know what he'll say.""Perhaps I'd better go away," suggested her daughter."No," she said; "he needn't know just yet.But in her
heart of hearts she knew that the evil day could not be long
postponed.One day, when her own suspense had reached such a pitch that it
could no longer be endured, Mrs.Gerhardt sent Jennie away with the
children, hoping to be able to tell her husband before they returned.All the morning she fidgeted about, dreading the opportune moment and
letting him retire to his slumber without speaking.When afternoon
came she did not go out to work, because she could not leave with her
painful duty unfulfilled.Gerhardt arose at four, and still she
hesitated, knowing full well that Jennie would soon return and that
the specially prepared occasion would then be lost.It is almost
certain that she would not have had the courage to say anything if he
himself had not brought up the subject of Jennie's appearance."She doesn't look well," he said."There seems to be something the
matter with her."Gerhardt, visibly struggling with her fears, and
moved to make an end of it at any cost, "Jennie is in trouble.She--"

Gerhardt, who had unscrewed a door-lock and was trying to mend it,
looked up sharply from his work.Gerhardt had her apron in her hands at the time, her nervous
tendency to roll it coming upon her.She tried to summon sufficient
courage to explain, but fear mastered her completely; she lifted the
apron to her eyes and began to cry.He was a man with the Calvin type
of face, rather spare, with skin sallow and discolored as the result
of age and work in the wind and rain.When he was surprised or angry
sparks of light glittered in his eyes.He frequently pushed his hair
back when he was troubled, and almost invariably walked the floor;
just now he looked alert and dangerous.he inquired in German, his voice straining
to a hard note."In trouble--has some one--" He paused and
flung his hand upward.Gerhardt, frightened, and yet
following her own train of thought, "that anything like that would
happen to her.she concluded, "to think
he should ruin Jennie."shouted Gerhardt, giving way to a fury of feeling, "I
thought so!That comes of letting her go
running around at nights, buggy-riding, walking the streets.God in heaven!--"

He broke from his dramatic attitude and struck out in a fierce
stride across the narrow chamber, turning like a caged animal.So he has ruined her, has
he?"Suddenly he stopped like an image jerked by a string.He was
directly in front of Mrs.Gerhardt, who had retired to the table at
the side of the wall, and was standing there pale with fear.he shouted, as if this fact had now first
occurred to him.He put both hands to his temples, as if he feared his brain would
give way, and stood looking at her, the mocking irony of the situation
seeming to burn in his brain like fire.Gerhardt, fearing for the reason of
the man, shrank still farther away, her wits taken up rather with the
tragedy of the figure he presented than with the actual substance of
his woe."He intended to marry her," she pleaded nervously."He would have
married her if he had not died."shouted Gerhardt, coming out of his trance at the
sound of her voice.That's a fine thing to talk about
now.May his soul burn in hell--the dog!Ah, God, I hope--I hope--If I were not a Christian--" He clenched
his hands, the awfulness of his passion shaking him like a leaf.Gerhardt burst into tears, and her husband turned away, his
own feelings far too intense for him to have any sympathy with her.He
walked to and fro, his heavy step shaking the kitchen floor.After a
time he came back, a new phase of the dread calamity having offered
itself to his mind.he demanded

"I don't know," returned Mrs.Gerhardt, too terror-stricken to tell
the truth."I only found it out the other day."It is your fault that she is where she is.If you had
let me have my way there would have been no cause for our trouble
to-night."A fine ending," he went on to himself.My boy gets
into jail; my daughter walks the streets and gets herself talked
about; the neighbors come to me with open remarks about my children;
and now this scoundrel ruins her.By the God in heaven, I don't know
what has got into my children!"I don't know how it is," he went on, unconsciously commiserating
himself.Every night I pray that the Lord will let me
do right, but it is no use.My hands--look
at them--are rough with work.All my life I have tried to be an
honest man.Now--now--" His voice broke, and it seemed for a
moment as if he would give way to tears.Suddenly he turned on his
wife, the major passion of anger possessing him."You are the cause of this," he exclaimed.If you had done as I told you to do this would not have happened.She has become a
street-walker, that's what she has become.She has set herself right
to go to hell.He made as if to go off to his little bedroom, but he had no sooner
reached the door than he came back."She shall not stay
under my roof!I will not let her enter my door
again.I will show her whether she will disgrace me or not!""You mustn't turn her out on the streets to-night," pleaded Mrs.We will see how the
world treats her."He walked out of the room, inflexible resolution
fixed upon his rugged features.Gerhardt was tearfully going about the
duty of getting supper, Jennie returned.Her mother started when she
heard the door open, for now she knew the storm would burst afresh."You shall not stay
another hour in my house.I don't want to see you any more.Jennie stood before him, pale, trembling a little, and silent.The
children she had brought home with her crowded about in frightened
amazement.Veronica and Martha, who loved her dearly, began to
cry."She shall get out," reiterated Gerhardt."I don't want her under
my roof.If she wants to be a street-walker, let her be one, but she
shall not stay here.Pack your things," he added, staring at her.Jennie had no word to say, but the children cried loudly.He drove them all out and followed stubbornly himself.She gathered up her few little
belongings and began, with tears, to put them into a valise her mother
brought her.The little girlish trinkets that she had accumulated from
time to time she did not take.She saw them, but thought of her
younger sisters, and let them stay.Martha and Veronica would have
assisted her, but their father forbade them to go.At six o'clock Bass came in, and seeing the nervous assembly in the
kitchen, inquired what the trouble was.Gerhardt looked at him grimly, but did not answer."What are you all sitting
around for?""He is driving Jennie away," whispered Mrs.asked Bass, opening his eyes in astonishment."I shall tell you what for," broke in Gerhardt, still speaking in
German."Because she's a street-walker, that's what for.She goes and
gets herself ruined by a man thirty years older than she is, a man old
enough to be her father.Bass looked about him, and the children opened their eyes.All felt
clearly that something terrible had happened, even the little ones."What do you want to send her out to-night for?""This
is no time to send a girl out on the streets."He oughtn't to do that," put in the mother.Bass looked around, but did nothing until Mrs.Gerhardt motioned
him toward the front door when her husband was not looking.Gerhardt dared to leave her work and
follow.The children stayed awhile, but, one by one, even they slipped
away, leaving Gerhardt alone.When he thought that time enough had
elapsed he arose.In the interval Jennie had been hastily coached by her mother.Jennie should go to a private boarding-house somewhere, and send
back her address.Bass should not accompany her, but she should wait a
little way up the street, and he would follow.When her father was
away the mother might get to see her, or Jennie could come home.All
else must be postponed until they could meet again.While the discussion was still going on, Gerhardt came in.Gerhardt, with her first and only note of
defiance.Bass said, "What's the hurry?"But Gerhardt frowned too mightily
for him to venture on any further remonstrance.Jennie entered, wearing her one good dress and carrying her valise.There was fear in her eyes, for she was passing through a fiery
ordeal, but she had become a woman.The strength of love was with her,
the support of patience and the ruling sweetness of sacrifice.Silently she kissed her mother, while tears fell fast.Then she
turned, and the door closed upon her as she went forth to a new
life.CHAPTER X


The world into which Jennie was thus unduly thrust forth was that
in which virtue has always vainly struggled since time immemorial; for
virtue is the wishing well and the doing well unto others.Virtue is
that quality of generosity which offers itself willingly for another's
service, and, being this, it is held by society to be nearly
worthless.Sell yourself cheaply and you shall be used lightly and
trampled under foot.Hold yourself dearly, however unworthily, and you
will be respected.Society, in the mass, lacks woefully in the matter
of discrimination.Its one
test that of self-preservation.Only in rare instances and with rare individuals
does there seem to be any guiding light from within.Jennie had not sought to hold herself dear.Innate feeling in her
made for self-sacrifice.She could not be readily corrupted by the
world's selfish lessons on how to preserve oneself from the evil to
come.It is in such supreme moments that growth is greatest.It comes as
with a vast surge, this feeling of strength and sufficiency.We may
still tremble, the fear of doing wretchedly may linger, but we grow.Flashes of inspiration come to guide the soul.When we are cast from a group or a condition we have still
the companionship of all that is.Its winds
and stars are fellows with you.Let the soul be but gentle and
receptive, and this vast truth will come home--not in set
phrases, perhaps, but as a feeling, a comfort, which, after all, is
the last essence of knowledge.Jennie had hardly turned from the door when she was overtaken by
Bass."Give me your grip," he said; and then seeing that she was dumb
with unutterable feeling, he added, "I think I know where I can get
you a room."He led the way to the southern part of the city, where they were
not known, and up to the door of an old lady whose parlor clock had
been recently purchased from the instalment firm by whom he was now
employed.She was not well off, he knew, and had a room to rent."Yes," she said, looking at Jennie."I wish you'd let my sister have it.We're moving away, and she
can't go yet."The old lady expressed her willingness, and Jennie was soon
temporarily installed."Don't worry now," said Bass, who felt rather sorry for her.Ma said I should tell you not to worry.Come up
to-morrow when he's gone."Jennie said she would, and, after giving her further oral
encouragement, he arranged with the old lady about board, and took his
leave."It's all right now," he said encouragingly as he went out.I've got to go back, but I'll come
around in the morning."He went away, and the bitter stress of it blew lightly over his
head, for he was thinking that Jennie had made a mistake.This was
shown by the manner in which he had asked her questions as they had
walked together, and that in the face of her sad and doubtful
mood."What'd you want to do that for?"and "Didn't you ever think what
you were doing?""Please don't ask me to-night," Jennie had said, which put an end
to the sharpest form of his queries.She had no excuse to offer and no
complaint to make.If any blame attached, very likely it was hers.His
own misfortune and the family's and her sacrifice were alike
forgotten.Left alone in her strange abode, Jennie gave way to her saddened
feelings.The shock and shame of being banished from her home overcame
her, and she wept.Although of a naturally long-suffering and
uncomplaining disposition, the catastrophic wind-up of all her hopes
was too much for her.What was this element in life that could seize
and overwhelm one as does a great wind?Why this sudden intrusion of
death to shatter all that had seemed most promising in life?As she thought over the past, a very clear recollection of the
details of her long relationship with Brander came back to her, and
for all her suffering she could only feel a loving affection for him.After all, he had not deliberately willed her any harm.His kindness,
his generosity--these things had been real.He had been
essentially a good man, and she was sorry--more for his sake than
for her own that his end had been so untimely.These cogitations, while not at all reassuring, at least served to
pass the night away, and the next morning Bass stopped on his way to
work to say that Mrs.Gerhardt wished her to come home that same
evening.Gerhardt would not be present, and they could talk it over.She spent the day lonesomely enough, but when night fell her spirits
brightened, and at a quarter of eight she set out.There was not much of comforting news to tell her.Gerhardt was
still in a direfully angry and outraged mood.He had already decided
to throw up his place on the following Saturday and go to Youngstown.Any place was better than Columbus after this; he could never expect
to hold up his head here again.He would go
away now, and if he succeeded in finding work the family should
follow, a decision which meant the abandoning of the little home.He
was not going to try to meet the mortgage on the house--he could
not hope to.At the end of the week Gerhardt took his leave, Jennie returned
home, and for a time at least there was a restoration of the old
order, a condition which, of course, could not endure.Jennie's trouble and its possible consequences weighed
upon him disagreeably.If they should all move away to some larger city it
would be much better.He pondered over the situation, and hearing that a manufacturing
boom was on in Cleveland, he thought it might be wise to try his luck
there.If Gerhardt still
worked on in Youngstown, as he was now doing, and the family came to
Cleveland, it would save Jennie from being turned out in the
streets.Bass waited a little while before making up his mind, but finally
announced his purpose."I believe I'll go up to Cleveland," he said to his mother one
evening as she was getting supper.She was rather afraid
that Bass would desert her."I think I can get work there," he returned."We oughtn't to stay
in this darned old town.""Don't swear," she returned reprovingly."Oh, I know," he said, "but it's enough to make any one swear.We've never had anything but rotten luck here.I'm going to go, and
maybe if I get anything we can all move.We'd be better off if we'd
get some place where people don't know us.Gerhardt listened with a strong hope for a betterment of their
miserable life creeping into her heart.If
he would go and get work, and come to her rescue, as a strong bright
young son might, what a thing it would be!They were in the rapids of
a life which was moving toward a dreadful calamity."Do you think you could get something to do?""I've never looked for a place yet that I
didn't get it.Other fellows have gone up there and done all right.He shoved his hands into his pockets and looked out the window."Do you think you could get along until I try my hand up there?""Papa's at work now and we have
some money that, that--" she hesitated, to name the source, so
ashamed was she of their predicament."Yes, I know," said Bass, grimly."We won't have to pay any rent here before fall and then we'll have
to give it up anyhow," she added.She was referring to the mortgage on the house, which fell due the
next September and which unquestionably could not be met."If we could
move away from here before then, I guess we could get along.""I'll do it," said Bass determinedly.Accordingly, he threw up his place at the end of the month, and the
day after he left for Cleveland.CHAPTER XI


The incidents of the days that followed, relating as they did
peculiarly to Jennie, were of an order which the morality of our day
has agreed to taboo.Certain processes of the all-mother, the great artificing wisdom of
the power that works and weaves in silence and in darkness, when
viewed in the light of the established opinion of some of the little
individuals created by it, are considered very vile.We turn our faces
away from the creation of life as if that were the last thing that man
should dare to interest himself in, openly.It is curious that a feeling of this sort should spring up in a
world whose very essence is generative, the vast process dual, and
where wind, water, soil, and light alike minister to the fruition of
that which is all that we are.Although the whole earth, not we alone,
is moved by passions hymeneal, and everything terrestrial has come
into being by the one common road, yet there is that ridiculous
tendency to close the eyes and turn away the head as if there were
something unclean in nature itself."Conceived in iniquity and born in
sin," is the unnatural interpretation put upon the process by the
extreme religionist, and the world, by its silence, gives assent to a
judgment so marvelously warped.Surely there is something radically wrong in this attitude.The
teachings of philosophy and the deductions of biology should find more
practical application in the daily reasoning of man.No process is
vile, no condition is unnatural.The accidental variation from a given
social practice does not necessarily entail sin.No poor little
earthling, caught in the enormous grip of chance, and so swerved from
the established customs of men, could possibly be guilty of that depth
of vileness which the attitude of the world would seem to predicate so
inevitably.Jennie was now to witness the unjust interpretation of that wonder
of nature, which, but for Brander's death, might have been consecrated
and hallowed as one of the ideal functions of life.Although herself
unable to distinguish the separateness of this from every other normal
process of life, yet was she made to feel, by the actions of all about
her, that degradation was her portion and sin the foundation as well
as the condition of her state.Almost, not quite, it was sought to
extinguish the affection, the consideration, the care which,
afterward, the world would demand of her, for her child.Almost, not
quite, was the budding and essential love looked upon as evil.Although her punishment was neither the gibbet nor the jail of a few
hundred years before, yet the ignorance and immobility of the human
beings about her made it impossible for them to see anything in her
present condition but a vile and premeditated infraction of the social
code, the punishment of which was ostracism.All she could do now was
to shun the scornful gaze of men, and to bear in silence the great
change that was coming upon her.Strangely enough, she felt no useless
remorse, no vain regrets.Her heart was pure, and she was conscious
that it was filled with peace.Sorrow there was, it is true, but only
a mellow phase of it, a vague uncertainty and wonder, which would
sometimes cause her eyes to fill with tears.You have heard the wood-dove calling in the lone stillness of the
summertime; you have found the unheeded brooklet singing and babbling
where no ear comes to hear.Under dead leaves and snow-banks the
delicate arbutus unfolds its simple blossom, answering some heavenly
call for color.So, too, this other flower of womanhood.Jennie was left alone, but, like the wood-dove, she was a voice of
sweetness in the summer-time.Going about her household duties, she
was content to wait, without a murmur, the fulfilment of that process
for which, after all, she was but the sacrificial implement.When her
duties were lightest she was content to sit in quiet meditation, the
marvel of life holding her as in a trance.When she was hardest
pressed to aid her mother, she would sometimes find herself quietly
singing, the pleasure of work lifting her out of herself.Always she
was content to face the future with a serene and unfaltering courage.Nature is unkind in permitting the minor
type to bear a child at all.The larger natures in their maturity
welcome motherhood, see in it the immense possibilities of racial
fulfilment, and find joy and satisfaction in being the hand-maiden of
so immense a purpose.Jennie, a child in years, was potentially a woman physically and
mentally, but not yet come into rounded conclusions as to life and her
place in it.The great situation which had forced her into this
anomalous position was from one point of view a tribute to her
individual capacity.It proved her courage, the largeness of her
sympathy, her willingness to sacrifice for what she considered a
worthy cause.That it resulted in an unexpected consequence, which
placed upon her a larger and more complicated burden, was due to the
fact that her sense of self-protection had not been commensurate with
her emotions.There were times when the prospective coming of the
child gave her a sense of fear and confusion, because she did not know
but that the child might eventually reproach her; but there was always
that saving sense of eternal justice in life which would not permit
her to be utterly crushed.To her way of thinking, people were not
intentionally cruel.Vague thoughts of sympathy and divine goodness
permeated her soul.Life at worst or best was beautiful--had
always been so.These thoughts did not come to her all at once, but through the
months during which she watched and waited.It was a wonderful thing
to be a mother, even under these untoward conditions.She felt that
she would love this child, would be a good mother to it if life
permitted.That was the problem--what would life permit?There were many things to be done--clothes to be made; certain
provisions of hygiene and diet to be observed.One of her fears was
that Gerhardt might unexpectedly return, but he did not.The old
family doctor who had nursed the various members of the Gerhardt
family through their multitudinous ailments--Doctor
Ellwanger--was taken into consultation, and he gave sound and
practical advice.Despite his Lutheran upbringing, the practice of
medicine in a large and kindly way had led him to the conclusion that
there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our
philosophies and in our small neighborhood relationships."So it is,"
he observed to Mrs.Gerhardt when she confided to him nervously what
the trouble was.These things happen in more
places than you think.If you knew as much about life as I do, and
about your neighbors, you would not cry.She can go away somewhere afterward, and people
will never know.Why should you worry about what your neighbors think.As for Jennie, she listened to his advice with
interest and without fear.She wanted things not so much for herself
as for her child, and she was anxious to do whatever she was told.The
doctor was curious to know who the father was; when informed he lifted
his eyes."That ought to be a bright
baby."There came the final hour when the child was ushered into the
world.It was Doctor Ellwanger who presided, assisted by the mother,
who, having brought forth six herself, knew exactly what to do.There
was no difficulty, and at the first cry of the new-born infant there
awakened in Jennie a tremendous yearning toward it.It was weak and feeble--a little girl, and it
needed her care.She took it to her breast, when it had been bathed
and swaddled, with a tremendous sense of satisfaction and joy.This
was her child, her little girl.She wanted to live to be able to work
for it, and rejoiced, even in her weakness, that she was so strong.He thought two weeks
would be the outside limit of her need to stay in bed.As a matter of
fact, in ten days she was up and about, as vigorous and healthy as
ever.She had been born with strength and with that nurturing quality
which makes the ideal mother.The great crisis had passed, and now life went on much as before.The children, outside of Bass, were too young to understand fully, and
had been deceived by the story that Jennie was married to Senator
Brander, who had died.They did not know that a child was coming until
it was there.Gerhardt, for they
were ever watchful and really knew all.Jennie would never have braved
this local atmosphere except for the advice of Bass, who, having
secured a place in Cleveland some time before, had written that he
thought when she was well enough it would be advisable for the whole
family to seek a new start in Cleveland.Once away they would never hear of their present neighbors and
Jennie could find something to do.CHAPTER XII


Bass was no sooner in Cleveland than the marvel of that growing
city was sufficient to completely restore his equanimity of soul and
to stir up new illusions as to the possibility of rehabilitation for
himself and his family."If only they could come here," he thought."If only they could all get work and do right."Here was no evidence
of any of their recent troubles, no acquaintances who could suggest by
their mere presence the troubles of the past.The very turning of the corner seemed to rid one of old
times and crimes.It was as if a new world existed in every block.He soon found a place in a cigar store, and, after working a few
weeks, he began to write home the cheering ideas he had in mind.Jennie ought to come as soon as she was able, and then, if she found
something to do, the others might follow.There was plenty of work for
girls of her age.She could live in the same house with him
temporarily; or maybe they could take one of the
fifteen-dollar-a-month cottages that were for rent.There were big
general furnishing houses, where one could buy everything needful for
a small house on very easy monthly terms.His mother could come and
keep house for them.They would be in a clean, new atmosphere, unknown
and untalked about.They could start life all over again; they could
be decent, honorable, prosperous.Filled with this hope and the glamor which new scenes and new
environment invariably throw over the unsophisticated mind, he wrote a
final letter, in which he suggested that Jennie should come at once.This was when the baby was six months old.There were theaters here,
he said, and beautiful streets.Vessels from the lakes came into the
heart of the city.It was a wonderful city, and growing very fast.It
was thus that the new life appealed to him.Gerhardt, Jennie, and the
rest of the family was phenomenal.Gerhardt, long weighed upon by
the misery which Jennie's error had entailed, was for taking measures
for carrying out this plan at once.So buoyant was her natural
temperament that she was completely carried away by the glory of
Cleveland, and already saw fulfilled therein not only her own desires
for a nice home, but the prosperous advancement of her children."Of
course they could get work," she said.She had always
wanted Gerhardt to go to some large city, but he would not.Now it was
necessary, and they would go and become better off than they ever had
been.And Gerhardt did take this view of the situation.In answer to his
wife's letter he wrote that it was not advisable for him to leave his
place, but if Bass saw a way for them, it might be a good thing to go.He was the more ready to acquiesce in the plan for the simple reason
that he was half distracted with the worry of supporting the family
and of paying the debts already outstanding.Every week he laid by
five dollars out of his salary, which he sent in the form of a postal
order to Mrs.Three dollars he paid for board, and fifty
cents he kept for spending money, church dues, a little tobacco and
occasionally a glass of beer.Every week he put a dollar and a half in
a little iron bank against a rainy day.His room was a bare corner in
the topmost loft of the mill.To this he would ascend after sitting
alone on the doorstep of the mill in this lonely, foresaken
neighborhood, until nine o'clock of an evening; and here, amid the
odor of machinery wafted up from the floor below, by the light of a
single tallow candle, he would conclude his solitary day, reading his
German paper, folding his hands and thinking, kneeling by an open
window in the shadow of the night to say his prayers, and silently
stretching himself to rest.Long were the days, dreary the prospect.Still he lifted his hands in utmost faith to God, praying that his
sins might be forgiven and that he might be vouchsafed a few more
years of comfort and of happy family life.There was the
greatest longing and impatience among the children, and Mrs.Gerhardt
shared their emotions in a suppressed way.Jennie was to go first, as
Bass had suggested; later on they would all follow.When the hour came for Jennie's departure there was great
excitement in the household."How long you going to be 'fore you send for us?"was Martha's
inquiry, several times repeated."Tell Bass to hurry up," said the eager George."I want to go to Cleveland, I want to go to Cleveland," Veronica
was caught singing to herself."Listen to her," exclaimed George, sarcastically."Aw, you hush up," was her displeased rejoinder.When the final hour came, however, it required all of Jennie's
strength to go through with the farewells.Though everything was being
done in order to bring them together again under better conditions,
she could not help feeling depressed.Her little one, now six months
old, was being left behind.The great world was to her one
undiscovered bourne."You mustn't worry, Ma," she found courage enough to say.I'll write you just as soon as I get there.But when it came to bending over her baby for the last time her
courage went out like a blown lamp.Stooping over the cradle in which
the little one was resting, she looked into its face with passionate,
motherly yearning."Is it going to be a good little girl?"Then she caught it up into her arms, and hugging it closely to her
neck and bosom, she buried her face against its little body."Come now," she said, coaxingly, "you mustn't carry on so.If you're going to act
this way, you'd better not try to go at all."Jennie lifted her head, her blue eyes wet with tears, and handed
the little one to her mother."I can't help it," she said, half crying, half smiling.Quickly she kissed her mother and the children; then she hurried
out.As she went down the street with George she looked back and bravely
waved her hand.Gerhardt responded, noticing how much more like a
woman she looked.It had been necessary to invest some of her money in
new clothes to wear on the train.She had selected a neat, ready-made
suit of brown, which fitted her nicely.She wore the skirt of this
with a white shirt-waist, and a sailor hat with a white veil wound
around it in such fashion that it could be easily drawn over her face.Gerhardt followed her
lovingly with her glance; and when she disappeared from view she said
tenderly, through her own tears:

"I'm glad she looked so nice, anyhow."CHAPTER XIII


Bass met Jennie at the depot in Cleveland and talked hopefully of
the prospects."The first thing is to get work," he began, while the
jingling sounds and the changing odors which the city thrust upon her
were confusing and almost benumbing her senses.It doesn't matter what, so long as you get something.If you don't get
more than three or four dollars a week, it will pay the rent.Then,
with what George can earn, when he comes, and what Pop sends, we can
get along all right.It'll be better than being down in that hole," he
concluded."Yes," said Jennie, vaguely, her mind so hypnotized by the new
display of life about her that she could not bring it forcibly to bear
upon the topic under discussion.She was much older now, in understanding if not in years.The
ordeal through which she had so recently passed had aroused in her a
clearer conception of the responsibilities of life.Her mother was
always in her mind, her mother and the children.In particular Martha
and Veronica must have a better opportunity to do for themselves than
she had had.They should be dressed better; they ought to be kept
longer in school; they must have more companionship, more opportunity
to broaden their lives.Cleveland, like every other growing city at this time, was crowded
with those who were seeking employment.New enterprises were
constantly springing up, but those who were seeking to fulfil the
duties they provided were invariably in excess of the demand.A
stranger coming to the city might walk into a small position of almost
any kind on the very day he arrived; and he might as readily wander in
search of employment for weeks and even months.Bass suggested the
shops and department stores as a first field in which to inquire.The
factories and other avenues of employment were to be her second
choice."Don't pass a place, though," he had cautioned her, "if you think
there's any chance of getting anything to do.You don't care what you do to begin
with."In compliance with this advice, Jennie set out the very first day,
and was rewarded by some very chilly experiences.Wherever she went,
no one seemed to want any help.She applied at the stores, the
factories, the little shops that lined the outlying thoroughfares, but
was always met by a rebuff.As a last resource she turned to
housework, although she had hoped to avoid that; and, studying the
want columns, she selected four which seemed more promising than the
others.One had already been filled
when she arrived, but the lady who came to the door was so taken by
her appearance that she invited her in and questioned her as to her
ability."I wish you had come a little earlier," she said."I like you
better than I do the girl I have taken.Jennie went away, smiling at her reception.She was not quite so
youthful looking as she had been before her recent trouble, but the
thinner cheeks and the slightly deeper eyes added to the pensiveness
and delicacy of her countenance.Her
clothes, all newly cleaned and ironed before leaving home, gave her a
fresh and inviting appearance.There was growth coming to her in the
matter of height, but already in appearance and intelligence she
looked to be a young woman of twenty.Best of all, she was of that
naturally sunny disposition, which, in spite of toil and privation,
kept her always cheerful.Any one in need of a servant-girl or house
companion would have been delighted to have had her.The second place at which she applied was a large residence in
Euclid Avenue; it seemed far too imposing for anything she might have
to offer in the way of services, but having come so far she decided to
make the attempt.The servant who met her at the door directed her to
wait a few moments, and finally ushered her into the boudoir of the
mistress of the house on the second floor.Bracebridge, a prepossessing brunette of the conventionally
fashionable type, had a keen eye for feminine values and was impressed
rather favorably with Jennie.She talked with her a little while, and
finally decided to try her in the general capacity of maid."I will give you four dollars a week, and you can sleep here if you
wish," said Mrs.Jennie explained that she was living with her brother, and would
soon have her family with her."Oh, very well," replied her mistress.She wished her to remain for the day and to begin her duties at
once, and Jennie agreed.Bracebridge provided her a dainty cap
and apron, and then spent some little time in instructing her in her
duties.Her principal work would be to wait on her mistress, to brush
her hair and to help her dress.She was also to answer the bell, wait
on the table if need be, and do any other errand which her mistress
might indicate.Bracebridge seemed a little hard and formal to
her prospective servant, but for all that Jennie admired the dash and
go and the obvious executive capacity of her employer.At eight o'clock that evening Jennie was dismissed for the day.She
wondered if she could be of any use in such a household, and marveled
that she had got along as well as she had.Her mistress had set her to
cleaning her jewelry and boudoir ornaments as an opening task, and
though she had worked steadily and diligently, she had not finished by
the time she left.She hurried away to her brother's apartment,
delighted to be able to report that she had found a situation.Now they could really begin that new life which was to be so much
better and finer and sweeter than anything they had ever had
before.At Bass's suggestion Jennie wrote her mother to come at once, and a
week or so later a suitable house was found and rented.Gerhardt,
with the aid of the children, packed up the simple belongings of the
family, including a single vanload of furniture, and at the end of a
fortnight they were on their way to the new home.Gerhardt always had had a keen desire for a really comfortable
home.Solid furniture, upholstered and trimmed, a thick, soft carpet
of some warm, pleasing color, plenty of chairs, settees, pictures, a
lounge, and a piano she had wanted these nice things all her life, but
her circumstances had never been good enough for her hopes to be
realized.Some day, maybe, before she died
these things would be added to her, and she would be happy.Arrived at Cleveland, this feeling of optimism was encouraged by
the sight of Jennie's cheerful face.Bass assured her that they would
get along all right.He took them out to the house, and George was
shown the way to go back to the depot and have the freight looked
after.Gerhardt had still fifty dollars left out of the money
which Senator Brander had sent to Jennie, and with this a way of
getting a little extra furniture on the instalment plan was provided.Bass had already paid the first month's rent, and Jennie had spent her
evenings for the last few days in washing the windows and floors of
this new house and in getting it into a state of perfect cleanliness.Now, when the first night fell, they had two new mattresses and
comfortables spread upon a clean floor; a new lamp, purchased from one
of the nearby stores, a single box, borrowed by Jennie from a grocery
store, for cleaning purposes, upon which Mrs.Gerhardt could sit, and
some sausages and bread to stay them until morning.They talked and
planned for the future until nine o'clock came, when all but Jennie
and her mother retired.These two talked on, the burden of
responsibilities resting on the daughter.Gerhardt had come to
feel in a way dependent upon her.In the course of a week the entire cottage was in order, with a
half-dozen pieces of new furniture, a new carpet, and some necessary
kitchen utensils.The most disturbing thing was the need of a new
cooking-stove, the cost of which added greatly to the bill.The
younger children were entered at the public school, but it was decided
that George must find some employment.Both Jennie and her mother felt
the injustice of this keenly, but knew no way of preventing the
sacrifice."We will let him go to school next year if we can," said
Jennie.Auspiciously as the new life seemed to have begun, the closeness
with which their expenses were matching their income was an
ever-present menace.Bass, originally very generous in his
propositions, soon announced that he felt four dollars a week for his
room and board to be a sufficient contribution from himself.Jennie
gave everything she earned, and protested that she did not stand in
need of anything, so long as the baby was properly taken care of.George secured a place as an overgrown cash-boy, and brought in two
dollars and fifty cents a week, all of which, at first, he gladly
contributed.Later on he was allowed the fifty cents for himself as
being meet and just.Gerhardt, from his lonely post of labor,
contributed five dollars by mail, always arguing that a little money
ought to be saved in order that his honest debts back in Columbus
might be paid.Out of this total income of fifteen dollars a week all
of these individuals had to be fed and clothed, the rent paid, coal
purchased, and the regular monthly instalment of three dollars paid on
the outstanding furniture bill of fifty dollars.How it was done, those comfortable individuals, who frequently
discuss the social aspects of poverty, might well trouble to inform
themselves.Rent, coal, and light alone consumed the goodly sum of
twenty dollars a month; food, another unfortunately necessary item,
used up twenty-five more; clothes, instalments, dues, occasional items
of medicine and the like, were met out of the remaining eleven
dollars--how, the ardent imagination of the comfortable reader
can guess.It was done, however, and for a time the hopeful members
considered that they were doing fairly well.During this period the little family presented a picture of
honorable and patient toil, which was interesting to contemplate.Gerhardt, who worked like a servant and who received
absolutely no compensation either in clothes, amusements, or anything
else, arose in the morning while the others slept, and built the fire.Then she took up the task of getting the breakfast.Often as she moved
about noiselessly in her thin, worn slippers, cushioned with pieces of
newspaper to make them fit, she looked in on Jennie, Bass, and George,
wrapped in their heavy slumbers, and with that divine sympathy which
is born in heaven she wished that they did not need to rise so early
or to work so hard.Sometimes she would pause before touching her
beloved Jennie, gaze at her white face, so calm in sleep, and lament
that life had not dealt more kindly with her.Then she would lay her
hand gently upon her shoulder and whisper, "Jennie, Jennie," until the
weary sleeper would wake.When they returned at
night supper was waiting.Each of the children received a due share of
Mrs.The little baby was closely looked after by
her.She protested that she needed neither clothes nor shoes so long
as one of the children would run errands for her.Jennie, of all the children, fully understood her mother; she alone
strove, with the fullness of a perfect affection, to ease her
burden."Now, ma, I'll 'tend to that."These were the every-day expressions of the enduring affection that
existed between them.Always there was perfect understanding between
Jennie and her mother, and as the days passed this naturally widened
and deepened.Jennie could not bear to think of her as being always
confined to the house.Daily she thought as she worked of that humble
home where her mother was watching and waiting.How she longed to give
her those comforts which she had always craved!CHAPTER XIV


The days spent in the employ of the Bracebridge household were of a
broadening character.This great house was a school to Jennie, not
only in the matter of dress and manners, but as formulating a theory
of existence.Bracebridge and her husband were the last word in
the matter of self-sufficiency, taste in the matter of appointments,
care in the matter of dress, good form in the matter of reception,
entertainment, and the various usages of social life.Now and then,
apropos of nothing save her own mood, Mrs.Bracebridge would indicate
her philosophy of life in an epigram.If you gain anything you will have to
fight for it.""In my judgment it is silly not to take advantage of any aid which
will help you to be what you want to be."(This while applying a faint
suggestion of rouge.)They are exactly what they are capable
of being.I despise lack of taste; it is the worst crime."Most of these worldly-wise counsels were not given directly to
Jennie.She overheard them, but to her quiet and reflective mind they
had their import.Like seeds fallen upon good ground, they took root
and grew.She began to get a faint perception of hierarchies and
powers.They were not for her, perhaps, but they were in the world,
and if fortune were kind one might better one's state.She worked on,
wondering, however, just how better fortune might come to her.Who
would have her to wife knowing her history?How could she ever explain
the existence of her child?Her child, her child, the one transcendent, gripping theme of joy
and fear.If she could only do something for it--sometime,
somehow!By the closest
economy the children were clothed and kept in school, the rent paid,
and the instalments met.Once it looked as though there might be some
difficulty about the continuance of the home life, and that was when
Gerhardt wrote that he would be home for Christmas.The mill was to
close down for a short period at that time.He was naturally anxious
to see what the new life of his family at Cleveland was like.Gerhardt would have welcomed his return with unalloyed
pleasure had it not been for the fear she entertained of his creating
a scene.Jennie talked it over with her mother, and Mrs.Gerhardt in
turn spoke of it to Bass, whose advice was to brave it out."Don't worry," he said; "he won't do anything about it.I'll talk
to him if he says anything."The scene did occur, but it was not so unpleasant as Mrs.Gerhardt came home during the afternoon, while Bass,
Jennie, and George were at work.Two of the younger children went to
the train to meet him.Gerhardt greeted him
affectionately, but she trembled for the discovery which was sure to
come.Gerhardt opened the front bedroom
door only a few minutes after he arrived.On the white counterpane of
the bed was a pretty child, sleeping.He could not but know on the
instant whose it was, but he pretended ignorance."It's Jennie's," said Mrs."Not so very long ago," answered the mother, nervously."I guess she is here, too," he declared, contemptuously, refusing
to pronounce her name, a fact which he had already anticipated."She's working in a family," returned his wife in a pleading tone.Gerhardt had received a light since he had been away.Certain
inexplicable thoughts and feelings had come to him in his religious
meditations.In his prayers he had admitted to the All-seeing that he
might have done differently by his daughter.Yet he could not make up
his mind how to treat her for the future.She had committed a great
sin; it was impossible to get away from that.When Jennie came home that night a meeting was unavoidable.Gerhardt saw her coming, and pretended to be deeply engaged in a
newspaper.Gerhardt, who had begged him not to ignore Jennie
entirely, trembled for fear he would say or do something which would
hurt her feelings."She is coming now," she said, crossing to the door of the front
room, where he was sitting; but Gerhardt refused to look up."Speak to
her, anyhow," was her last appeal before the door opened; but he made
no reply.When Jennie came in her mother whispered, "He is in the front
room."Jennie paled, put her thumb to her lip and stood irresolute, not
knowing how to meet the situation.Jennie paused as she realized from her mother's face and nod that
Gerhardt knew of the child's existence.Jennie finally went to the door, and, seeing her father, his brow
wrinkled as if in serious but not unkindly thought, she hesitated, but
made her way forward."Papa," she said, unable to formulate a definite sentence.Gerhardt looked up, his grayish-brown eyes a study under their
heavy sandy lashes.At the sight of his daughter he weakened
internally; but with the self-adjusted armor of resolve about him he
showed no sign of pleasure at seeing her.All the forces of his
conventional understanding of morality and his naturally sympathetic
and fatherly disposition were battling within him, but, as in so many
cases where the average mind is concerned, convention was temporarily
the victor."Won't you forgive me, Papa?"She hesitated a moment, and then stepped forward, for what purpose
he well understood."There," he said, pushing her gently away, as her lips barely
touched his grizzled cheek.When Jennie went out into the kitchen after this very trying ordeal
she lifted her eyes to her waiting mother and tried to make it seem as
though all had been well, but her emotional disposition got the better
of her.her mother was about to ask; but the words
were only half out of her mouth before her daughter sank down into one
of the chairs close to the kitchen table and, laying her head on her
arm, burst forth into soft, convulsive, inaudible sobs.It was some time before Jennie recovered herself sufficiently to
answer."I wouldn't feel bad," she said.CHAPTER XV


The return of Gerhardt brought forward the child question in all
its bearings.He could not help considering it from the standpoint of
a grandparent, particularly since it was a human being possessed of a
soul."No, not yet," said his wife, who had not forgotten this duty, but
had been uncertain whether the little one would be welcome in the
faith."No, of course not," sneered Gerhardt, whose opinion of his wife's
religious devotion was not any too great.He thought it over a few moments, and felt that this evil should be
corrected at once."Why don't she take it and have
it baptized?"Gerhardt reminded him that some one would have to stand
godfather to the child, and there was no way to have the ceremony
performed without confessing the fact that it was without a legitimate
father.Gerhardt listened to this, and it quieted him for a few moments,
but his religion was something which he could not see put in the
background by any such difficulty.How would the Lord look upon
quibbling like this?It was not Christian, and it was his duty to
attend to the matter.It must be taken, forthwith, to the church,
Jennie, himself, and his wife accompanying it as sponsors; or, if he
did not choose to condescend thus far to his daughter, he must see
that it was baptized when she was not present.He brooded over this
difficulty, and finally decided that the ceremony should take place on
one of these week-days between Christmas and New Year's, when Jennie
would be at her work.This proposal he broached to his wife, and,
receiving her approval, he made his next announcement."It has no
name," he said.Jennie and her mother had talked over this very matter, and Jennie
had expressed a preference for Vesta.Now her mother made bold to
suggest it as her own choice.Secretly he had settled the
question in his own mind.He had a name in store, left over from the
halcyon period of his youth, and never opportunely available in the
case of his own children--Wilhelmina.Of course he had no idea of
unbending in the least toward his small granddaughter.He merely liked
the name, and the child ought to be grateful to get it.With a
far-off, gingery air he brought forward this first offering upon the
altar of natural affection, for offering it was, after all."That is nice," he said, forgetting his indifference."But how
would Wilhelmina do?"Gerhardt did not dare cross him when he was thus unconsciously
weakening."We might give her both names," she compromised."It makes no difference to me," he replied, drawing back into the
shell of opposition from which he had been inadvertently drawn.Jennie heard of this with pleasure, for she was anxious that the
child should have every advantage, religious or otherwise, that it was
possible to obtain.She took great pains to starch and iron the
clothes it was to wear on the appointed day.Gerhardt sought out the minister of the nearest Lutheran church, a
round-headed, thick-set theologian of the most formal type, to whom he
stated his errand."Yes," said Gerhardt, "her father is not here.""So," replied the minister, looking at him curiously.Gerhardt was not to be disturbed in his purpose.He explained that
he and his wife would bring her.The minister, realizing the probable
difficulty, did not question him further."The church cannot refuse to baptize her so long as you, as
grandparent, are willing to stand sponsor for her," he said.Gerhardt came away, hurt by the shadow of disgrace in which he felt
himself involved, but satisfied that he had done his duty.Now he
would take the child and have it baptized, and when that was over his
present responsibility would cease.When it came to the hour of the baptism, however, he found that
another influence was working to guide him into greater interest and
responsibility.The stern religion with which he was enraptured, its
insistence upon a higher law, was there, and he heard again the
precepts which had helped to bind him to his own children."Is it your intention to educate this child in the knowledge and
love of the gospel?"asked the black-gowned minister, as they stood
before him in the silent little church whither they had brought the
infant; he was reading from the form provided for such occasions."Do you engage to use all necessary care and diligence, by
prayerful instruction, admonition, example, and discipline that this
child may renounce and avoid everything that is evil and that she may
keep God's will and commandments as declared in His sacred word?"A thought flashed through Gerhardt's mind as the words were uttered
of how it had fared with his own children.They, too, had been thus
sponsored.They too, had heard his solemn pledge to care for their
spiritual welfare."We do," repeated Gerhardt and his wife weakly."Do you now dedicate this child by the rite of baptism unto the
Lord, who brought it?""And, finally, if you can conscientiously declare before God that
the faith to which you have assented is your faith, and that the
solemn promises you have made are the serious resolutions of your
heart, please to announce the same in the presence of God, by saying
'Yes.'""I baptize thee, Wilhelmina Vesta," concluded the minister,
stretching out his hand over her, "in the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Ghost.Gerhardt bent his gray head and followed with humble reverence the
beautiful invocation which followed:

"Almighty and everlasting God!we adore Thee as the great Parent of
the children of men, as the Father of our spirits and the Former of
our bodies.We praise Thee for giving existence to this infant and for
preserving her until this day.We bless Thee that she is called to
virtue and glory, that she has now been dedicated to Thee, and brought
within-the pale of the Christian Church.We thank Thee that by the
Gospel of the Son she is furnished with everything necessary to her
spiritual happiness; that it supplies light for her mind and comfort
for her heart, encouragement and power to discharge her duty, and the
precious hope of mercy and immortality to sustain and make her
faithful.And we beseech Thee, O most merciful God, that this child
may be enlightened and sanctified from her early years by the Holy
Spirit, and be everlastingly saved by Thy mercy.Direct and bless Thy
servants who are intrusted with the care of her in the momentous work
of her education.Inspire them with just conception of the absolute
necessity of religious instruction and principles.Forbid that they
should ever forget that this offspring belongs to Thee, and that, if
through their criminal neglect or bad example Thy reasonable creature
be lost, Thou wilt require it at their hands.Give them a deep sense
of the divinity of her nature, of the worth of her soul, of the
dangers to which she will be exposed, of the honor and felicity to
which she is capable of ascending with Thy blessing, and of the ruin
in this world and the misery in the world to come which springs from
wicked passion and conduct.Give them grace to check the first risings
of forbidden inclinations in her breast, to be her defense against the
temptations incident to childhood and youth, and, as she grows up, to
enlarge her understanding and to lead her to an acquaintance with Thee
and with Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.Give them grace to
cultivate in her heart a supreme reverence and love for Thee, a
grateful attachment to the Gospel of Thy Son, her Saviour, a due
regard for all its ordinances and institutions, a temper of kindness
and goodwill to all mankind, and an invincible love of sincerity and
truth.Help them to watch continually over her with tender solicitude,
to be studious, that by their conversation and deportment her heart
may not be corrupted, and at all times to set before her such an
example that she may safely tread in their footsteps.If it please
Thee to prolong her days on earth, grant that she may prove an honor
and a comfort to her parents and friends, be useful in the world, and
find in Thy Providence an unfailing defense and support.Whether she
live, let her live to Thee; or whether she die, let her die to Thee.And, at the great day of account, may she and her parents meet each
other with rapture and rejoice together in Thy redeeming love, through
Jesus Christ, forever and ever, Amen."As this solemn admonition was read a feeling of obligation
descended upon the grandfather of this little outcast; a feeling that
he was bound to give the tiny creature lying on his wife's arm the
care and attention which God in His sacrament had commanded.He bowed
his head in utmost reverence, and when the service was concluded and
they left the silent church he was without words to express his
feelings.God was a person, a
dominant reality.Religion was not a thing of mere words or of
interesting ideas to be listened to on Sunday, but a strong, vital
expression of the Divine Will handed down from a time when men were in
personal contact with God.Its fulfilment was a matter of joy and
salvation with him, the one consolation of a creature sent to wander
in a vale whose explanation was not here but in heaven.Slowly
Gerhardt walked on, and as he brooded on the words and the duties
which the sacrament involved the shade of lingering disgust that had
possessed him when he had taken the child to church disappeared and a
feeling of natural affection took its place.However much the daughter
had sinned, the infant was not to blame.It was a helpless, puling,
tender thing, demanding his sympathy and his love.Gerhardt felt his
heart go out to the little child, and yet he could not yield his
position all in a moment."That is a nice man," he said of the minister to his wife as they
walked along, rapidly softening in his conception of his duty."It's a good-sized little church," he continued.Gerhardt looked around him, at the street, the houses, the show of
brisk life on this sunshiny, winter's day, and then finally at the
child that his wife was carrying."She must be heavy," he said, in his characteristic German.Gerhardt, who was rather weary, did not refuse.he said, as he looked at her and then fixed her
comfortably upon his shoulder."Let us hope she proves worthy of all
that has been done to-day."Gerhardt listened, and the meaning in his voice interpreted
itself plainly enough.The presence of the child in the house might be
the cause of recurring spells of depression and unkind words, but
there would be another and greater influence restraining him.There
would always be her soul to consider.He would never again be utterly
unconscious of her soul.CHAPTER XVI


During the remainder of Gerhardt's stay he was shy in Jennie's
presence and endeavored to act as though he were unconscious of her
existence.When the time came for parting he even went away without
bidding her good-by, telling his wife she might do that for him; but
after he was actually on his way back to Youngstown he regretted the
omission."I might have bade her good-by," he thought to himself as
the train rumbled heavily along.For the time being the affairs of the Gerhardt family drifted.Sebastian fixed
himself firmly in his clerkship in the cigar store.George was
promoted to the noble sum of three dollars, and then three-fifty.It
was a narrow, humdrum life the family led.Coal, groceries, shoes, and
clothing were the uppermost topics of their conversation; every one
felt the stress and strain of trying to make ends meet.That which worried Jennie most, and there were many things which
weighed upon her sensitive soul, was the outcome of her own
life--not so much for herself as for her baby and the family.She
could not really see where she fitted in."How was she to dispose of Vesta in the
event of a new love affair?"She was young, good-looking, and men were inclined to flirt with her,
or rather to attempt it.The Bracebridges entertained many masculine
guests, and some of them had made unpleasant overtures to her."My dear, you're a very pretty girl," said one old rake of
fifty-odd when she knocked at his door one morning to give him a
message from his hostess.Mary moved to the office."I beg your pardon," she said, confusedly, and colored.I'd
like to talk to you some time."He attempted to chuck her under the chin, but Jennie hurried away.She would have reported the matter to her mistress but a nervous shame
deterred her.Could
it be because there was something innately bad about her, an inward
corruption that attracted its like?It is a curious characteristic of the non-defensive disposition
that it is like a honey-jar to flies.Nothing is brought to it and
much is taken away.Around a soft, yielding, unselfish disposition men
swarm naturally.They sense this generosity, this non-protective
attitude from afar.A girl like Jennie is like a comfortable fire to
the average masculine mind; they gravitate to it, seek its sympathy,
yearn to possess it.Hence she was annoyed by many unwelcome
attentions.One day there arrived from Cincinnati a certain Lester Kane, the
son of a wholesale carriage builder of great trade distinction in that
city and elsewhere throughout the country, who was wont to visit this
house frequently in a social way.Bracebridge
more than of her husband, for the former had been raised in Cincinnati
and as a girl had visited at his father's house.She knew his mother,
his brother and sisters and to all intents and purposes socially had
always been considered one of the family."Lester's coming to-morrow, Henry," Jennie heard Mrs."I had a wire from him this noon.I'm going to give him the big east front room up-stairs.Be sociable
and pay him some attention."I know it," said her husband calmly.He's the
biggest one in that family."I know; but he's so nice.I do think he's one of the nicest men I
ever knew."Don't I always do pretty well by your
people?""Oh, I don't know about that," he replied, dryly.When this notable person arrived Jennie was prepared to see some
one of more than ordinary importance, and she was not disappointed.There came into the reception-hall to greet her mistress a man of
perhaps thirty-six years of age, above the medium in height,
clear-eyed, firm-jawed, athletic, direct, and vigorous.He had a deep,
resonant voice that carried clearly everywhere; people somehow used to
stop and listen whether they knew him or not.He was simple and abrupt
in his speech."Oh, there you are," he began.He asked his questions forcefully, whole-heartedly, and his hostess
answered with an equal warmth."I'm glad to see you, Lester," she
said."George will take your things up-stairs.He followed her up the stairs, and Jennie, who had been standing at
the head of the stairs listening, felt the magnetic charm of his
personality.It seemed, why she could hardly say, that a real
personage had arrived.The attitude of her
mistress was much more complaisant.Everybody seemed to feel that
something must be done for this man.Jennie went about her work, but the impression persisted; his name
ran in her mind.She looked
at him now and then on the sly, and felt, for the first time in her
life, an interest in a man on his own account.He was so big, so
handsome, so forceful.At the same
time she felt a little dread of him.Once she caught him looking at
her with a steady, incisive stare.She quailed inwardly, and took the
first opportunity to get out of his presence.Another time he tried to
address a few remarks to her, but she pretended that her duties called
her away.She knew that often his eyes were on her when her back was
turned, and it made her nervous.She wanted to run away from him,
although there was no very definite reason why she should do so.As a matter of fact, this man, so superior to Jennie in wealth,
education, and social position, felt an instinctive interest in her
unusual personality.Like the others, he was attracted by the peculiar
softness of her disposition and her pre-eminent femininity.There was
that about her which suggested the luxury of love.He felt as if
somehow she could be reached why, he could not have said.She did not
bear any outward marks of her previous experience.There were no
evidences of coquetry about her, but still he "felt that he might."He
was inclined to make the venture on his first visit, but business
called him away; he left after four days and was absent from Cleveland
for three weeks.Jennie thought he was gone for good, and she
experienced a queer sense of relief as well as of regret.He came apparently unexpectedly, explaining to
Mrs.Bracebridge that business interests again demanded his presence
in Cleveland.As he spoke he looked at Jennie sharply, and she felt as
if somehow his presence might also concern her a little.On this second visit she had various opportunities of seeing him,
at breakfast, where she sometimes served, at dinner, when she could
see the guests at the table from the parlor or sitting-room, and at
odd times when he came to Mrs.Bracebridge's boudoir to talk things
over."Why don't you settle down, Lester, and get married?"Jennie heard
her say to him the second day he was there."I know," he replied, "but I'm in no mood for that.I want to
browse around a little while yet."You ought to be ashamed of
yourself.He has
got all he can attend to to look after the business."She scarcely understood what she
was thinking, but this man drew her.If she had realized in what way
she would have fled his presence then and there.Now he was more insistent in his observation of her--addressed
an occasional remark to her--engaged her in brief, magnetic
conversations.She could not help answering him--he was pleasing
to her.Once he came across her in the hall on the second floor
searching in a locker for some linen.Bracebridge having gone out to do some morning shopping and the other
servants being below stairs.On this occasion he made short work of
the business.He approached her in a commanding, unhesitating, and
thoroughly determined way."I want to talk to you," he said."I--I--" she stammered, and blanched perceptibly."I live
out on Lorrie Street."he questioned, as though she were compelled to tell
him."Thirteen fourteen," she replied
mechanically.He looked into her big, soft-blue eyes with his dark, vigorous
brown ones.A flash that was hypnotic, significant, insistent passed
between them."Oh, you mustn't," she said, her fingers going nervously to her
lips."I can't see you--I--I--"

"Oh, I mustn't, mustn't I?Look here"--he took her arm and
drew her slightly closer--"you and I might as well understand
each other right now.She looked at him, her eyes wide, filled with wonder, with fear,
with a growing terror."I don't know," she gasped, her lips dry.He fixed her grimly, firmly with his eyes."I'll talk to you later," he said,
and put his lips masterfully to hers.She was horrified, stunned, like a bird in the grasp of a cat; but
through it all something tremendously vital and insistent was speaking
to her."We won't do any more of
this here, but, remember, you belong to me," he said, as he turned and
walked nonchalantly down the hall.Jennie, in sheer panic, ran to her
mistress's room and locked the door behind her.CHAPTER XVII


The shock of this sudden encounter was so great to Jennie that she
was hours in recovering herself.At first she did not understand
clearly just what had happened.Out of clear sky, as it were, this
astonishing thing had taken place.she asked herself, and yet within her own consciousness
there was an answer.Though she could not explain her own emotions,
she belonged to him temperamentally and he belonged to her.There is a fate in love and a fate in fight.This strong,
intellectual bear of a man, son of a wealthy manufacturer, stationed,
so far as material conditions were concerned, in a world immensely
superior to that in which Jennie moved, was, nevertheless,
instinctively, magnetically, and chemically drawn to this poor
serving-maid.She was his natural affinity, though he did not know
it--the one woman who answered somehow the biggest need of his
nature.Lester Kane had known all sorts of women, rich and poor, the
highly bred maidens of his own class, the daughters of the
proletariat, but he had never yet found one who seemed to combine for
him the traits of an ideal woman--sympathy, kindliness of
judgment, youth, and beauty.Yet this ideal remained fixedly seated in
the back of his brain--when the right woman appeared he intended
to take her.He had the notion that, for purposes of marriage, he
ought perhaps to find this woman on his own plane.For purposes of
temporary happiness he might take her from anywhere, leaving marriage,
of course, out of the question.He had no idea of making anything like
a serious proposal to a servant-girl.He had
never seen a servant quite like her.And she was lady-like and lovely
without appearing to know it.Why
shouldn't he try to seize her?Let us be just to Lester Kane; let us
try to understand him and his position.Not every mind is to be
estimated by the weight of a single folly; not every personality is to
be judged by the drag of a single passion.We live in an age in which
the impact of materialized forces is well-nigh irresistible; the
spiritual nature is overwhelmed by the shock.The tremendous and
complicated development of our material civilization, the
multiplicity, and variety of our social forms, the depth, subtlety,
and sophistry of our imaginative impressions, gathered, remultiplied,
and disseminated by such agencies as the railroad, the express and the
post-office, the telephone, the telegraph, the newspaper, and, in
short, the whole machinery of social intercourse--these elements
of existence combine to produce what may be termed a kaleidoscopic
glitter, a dazzling and confusing phantasmagoria of life that wearies
and stultifies the mental and moral nature.It induces a sort of
intellectual fatigue through which we see the ranks of the victims of
insomnia, melancholia, and insanity constantly recruited.Our modern
brain-pan does not seem capable as yet of receiving, sorting, and
storing the vast army of facts and impressions which present
themselves daily.We are
weighed upon by too many things.It is as if the wisdom of the
infinite were struggling to beat itself into finite and cup-big
minds.Lester Kane was the natural product of these untoward conditions.His was a naturally observing mind, Rabelaisian in its strength and
tendencies, but confused by the multiplicity of things, the vastness
of the panorama of life, the glitter of its details, the unsubstantial
nature of its forms, the uncertainty of their justification.Born a
Catholic, he was no longer a believer in the divine inspiration of
Catholicism; raised a member of the social elect, he had ceased to
accept the fetish that birth and station presuppose any innate
superiority; brought up as the heir to a comfortable fortune and
expected to marry in his own sphere, he was by no means sure that he
wanted marriage on any terms.Of course the conjugal state was an
institution.True, but other nations believed in
polygamy.There were other questions that bothered him--such
questions as the belief in a single deity or ruler of the universe,
and whether a republican, monarchial, or aristocratic form of
government were best.In short, the whole body of things material,
social, and spiritual had come under the knife of his mental surgery
and been left but half dissected.Not a
single idea of his, unless it were the need of being honest, was
finally settled.In all other things he wavered, questioned,
procrastinated, leaving to time and to the powers back of the universe
the solution of the problems that vexed him.Yes, Lester Kane was the
natural product of a combination of elements--religious,
commercial, social--modified by that pervading atmosphere of
liberty in our national life which is productive of almost uncounted
freedom of thought and action.Thirty-six years of age, and apparently
a man of vigorous, aggressive, and sound personality, he was,
nevertheless, an essentially animal-man, pleasantly veneered by
education and environment.Like the hundreds of thousands of Irishmen
who in his father's day had worked on the railroad tracks, dug in the
mines, picked and shoveled in the ditches, and carried up bricks and
mortar on the endless structures of a new land, he was strong, hairy,
axiomatic, and witty."Do you want me to come back here next year?"he had asked of
Brother Ambrose, when, in his seventeenth year, that ecclesiastical
member was about to chastise him for some school-boy misdemeanor."Your father will have to
look after that," he replied."Well, my father won't look after it," Lester returned."If you
touch me with that whip I'll take things into my own hands.I'm not
committing any punishable offenses, and I'm not going to be knocked
around any more."Words, unfortunately, did not avail in this case, but a good,
vigorous Irish-American wrestle did, in which the whip was broken and
the discipline of the school so far impaired that he was compelled to
take his clothes and leave.After that he looked his father in the eye
and told him that he was not going to school any more."I'm perfectly willing to jump in and work," he explained."There's
nothing in a classical education for me.Let me go into the office,
and I guess I'll pick up enough to carry me through."Old Archibald Kane, keen, single-minded, of unsullied commercial
honor, admired his son's determination, and did not attempt to coerce
him."Come down to the office," he said; "perhaps there is something you
can do."Entering upon a business life at the age of eighteen, Lester had
worked faithfully, rising in his father's estimation, until now he had
come to be, in a way, his personal representative.Whenever there was
a contract to be entered upon, an important move to be decided, or a
representative of the manufactory to be sent anywhere to consummate a
deal, Lester was the agent selected.His father trusted him
implicitly, and so diplomatic and earnest was he in the fulfilment of
his duties that this trust had never been impaired."Business is business," was a favorite axiom with him and the very
tone in which he pronounced the words was a reflex of his character
and personality.There were molten forces in him, flames which burst forth now and
then in spite of the fact that he was sure that he had them under
control.One of these impulses was a taste for liquor, of which he was
perfectly sure he had the upper hand.He drank but very little, he
thought, and only, in a social way, among friends; never to excess.Another weakness lay in his sensual nature; but here again he believed
that he was the master.If he chose to have irregular relations with
women, he was capable of deciding where the danger point lay.If men
were only guided by a sense of the brevity inherent in all such
relationships there would not be so many troublesome consequences
growing out of them.Finally, he flattered himself that he had a grasp
upon a right method of living, a method which was nothing more than a
quiet acceptance of social conditions as they were, tempered by a
little personal judgment as to the right and wrong of individual
conduct.Not to fuss and fume, not to cry out about anything, not to
be mawkishly sentimental; to be vigorous and sustain your personality
intact--such was his theory of life, and he was satisfied that it
was a good one.As to Jennie, his original object in approaching her had been
purely selfish.But now that he had asserted his masculine
prerogatives, and she had yielded, at least in part, he began to
realize that she was no common girl, no toy of the passing hour.There is a time in some men's lives when they unconsciously begin
to view feminine youth and beauty not so much in relation to the ideal
of happiness, but rather with regard to the social conventions by
which they are environed.they ask themselves, in speculating concerning the
possibility of taking a maiden to wife, "that I shall be compelled to
swallow the whole social code, make a covenant with society, sign a
pledge of abstinence, and give to another a life interest in all my
affairs, when I know too well that I am but taking to my arms a
variable creature like myself, whose wishes are apt to become
insistent and burdensome in proportion to the decrease of her beauty
and interest?"These are the men, who, unwilling to risk the manifold
contingencies of an authorized connection, are led to consider the
advantages of a less-binding union, a temporary companionship.They
seek to seize the happiness of life without paying the cost of their
indulgence.Later on, they think, the more definite and conventional
relationship may be established without reproach or the necessity of
radical readjustment.Lester Kane was past the youthful love period, and he knew it.The
innocence and unsophistication of younger ideals had gone.He wanted
the comfort of feminine companionship, but he was more and more
disinclined to give up his personal liberty in order to obtain it.He
would not wear the social shackles if it were possible to satisfy the
needs of his heart and nature and still remain free and unfettered.Of
course he must find the right woman, and in Jennie he believed that he
had discovered her.She appealed to him on every side; he had never
known anybody quite like her.Marriage was not only impossible but
unnecessary.He had only to say "Come" and she must obey; it was her
destiny.Lester thought the matter over calmly, dispassionately.He strolled
out to the shabby street where she lived; he looked at the humble roof
that sheltered her.Her poverty, her narrow and straitened environment
touched his heart.Ought he not to treat her generously, fairly,
honorably?Then the remembrance of her marvelous beauty swept over him
and changed his mood.No, he must possess her if he
could--to-day, quickly, as soon as possible.It was in that frame
of mind that he returned to Mrs.Bracebridge's home from his visit to
Lorrie Street.CHAPTER XVIII


Jennie was now going through the agony of one who has a varied and
complicated problem to confront.Her baby, her father, her brothers,
and sisters all rose up to confront her.What was this thing that she
was doing?Was she allowing herself to slip into another wretched,
unsanctified relationship?How was she to explain to her family about
this man?He would not marry her, that was sure, if he knew all about
her.He would not marry her, anyhow, a man of his station and
position.Yet here she was parleying with him.She pondered over the problem until evening, deciding first that it
was best to run away, but remembering painfully that she had told him
where she lived.Then she resolved that she would summon up her
courage and refuse him--tell him she couldn't, wouldn't have
anything to do with him.This last solution of the difficulty seemed
simple enough--in his absence.And she would find work where he
could not follow her up so easily.It all seemed simple enough as she
put on her things in the evening to go home.Her aggressive lover, however, was not without his own conclusion
in this matter.Since leaving Jennie he had thought concisely and to
the point.He came to the decision that he must act at once.She might
tell her family, she might tell Mrs.Bracebridge, she might leave the
city.He wanted to know more of the conditions which surrounded her,
and there was only one way to do that--talk to her.He must
persuade her to come and live with him.That soft, yielding note in her character
which had originally attracted him seemed to presage that he could win
her without much difficulty, if he wished to try.He decided to do so,
anyhow, for truly he desired her greatly.At half-past five he returned to the Bracebridge home to see if she
were still there.At six he had an opportunity to say to her,
unobserved, "I am going to walk home with you.Wait for me at the next
corner, will you?""Yes," she said, a sense of compulsion to do his bidding seizing
her.She explained to herself afterward that she ought to talk to him,
that she must tell him finally of her decision not to see him again,
and this was as good an opportunity as any.At half-past six he left
the house on a pretext--a forgotten engagement--and a little
after seven he was waiting for her in a closed carriage near the
appointed spot.He was calm, absolutely satisfied as to the result,
and curiously elated beneath a sturdy, shock-proof exterior.It was as
if he breathed some fragrant perfume, soft, grateful, entrancing.A few minutes after eight he saw Jennie coming along.The flare of
the gas-lamp was not strong, but it gave sufficient light for his eyes
to make her out.A wave of sympathy passed over him, for there was a
great appeal in her personality.He stepped out as she neared the
corner and confronted her."Come," he said, "and get in this carriage
with me.Once more that sense of dominance on his part, that power of
compulsion.She yielded, feeling all the time that she should not; he
called out to the cabman, "Anywhere for a little while."When she was
seated beside him he began at once."Listen to me, Jennie, I want you."I have to talk to you," she replied, trying to stick to her
original line of defense.he inquired, seeking to fathom her expression in the
half light."I can't go on this way," she murmured nervously.I shouldn't have done what I did
this morning."You didn't do what you did this morning," he remarked,
paradoxically, seizing on that one particular expression.And as for seeing me any more, I'm going to see you.""You don't know me, but I like you.I'm crazy about you, that's
all.she replied in an agonized voice, "I can't do
anything like that, Mr.I couldn't, even if I wanted to.But I don't want to do anything wrong.He listened to this troubled, feverish outburst with sympathy, with
even a little pity."What do you mean by you can't?""Oh, I can't tell you," she replied.But I mustn't see you any more."But you like me," he retorted.But you mustn't come near me
any more.He turned his proposition over in his mind with the solemnity of a
judge.He knew that this girl liked him--loved him really, brief
as their contact had been.And he was drawn to her, perhaps not
irrevocably, but with exceeding strength.What prevented her from
yielding, especially since she wanted to?"See here, Jennie," he replied.I don't know
what you mean by 'can't' if you want to.I'd like to have you
with me.Oh,
please don't ask me any more.The man had a keen sense of justice and fair play.Above all things
he wanted to be decent in his treatment of people.In this case he
intended to be tender and considerate, and yet he must win her."Listen to me," he said finally, still holding her hand."I may not
want you to do anything immediately.I
like you, and I can do a lot of things for you.Why not let us be good
friends now?Then we can talk the rest of this over later.""But I mustn't do anything wrong," she insisted."Oh no, no, no," she half sobbed, swept by some force beyond her
control."Well, then, why stand out against me?I love you, I tell
you--I'm crazy about you.And I would have come again and again if necessary.I
tell you I'm crazy about you.Now tell me you'll
come with me.""No, no, no," she pleaded.I
don't want to do anything wrong."Tell me, Jennie," he said, changing the subject."Don't say'sir' to me, sweet!"I'm not'mister'
to you any more.You belong to me, little girl, me.""Listen to me, Jennie," he repeated, using his favorite expression.I
haven't had a chance to know you.You've
got to come to me eventually.And I'm not going to have you working as
a lady's maid.You can't stay in that place except for a little while.And I'm going to leave you some
money, do you hear?At the word money she quailed and withdrew her hand."The families of the poor," he thought."Well, you take this from me," he insisted, drawing a purse from
his coat."And I'll see you very soon again.No, you mustn't
ask me."He insisted further, but she was firm, and finally he put the money
away."One thing is sure, Jennie, you're not going to escape me," he said
soberly."You'll have to come to me eventually.I'm not going to leave you
alone.""Oh, if you knew the trouble you're causing me.""I'm not causing you any real trouble, am I?"he exclaimed eagerly, the bare thought of
this prize escaping him heightening his passion.And he drew her close in spite of all her protests."There," he said when, after the struggle, that mystic something
between them spoke again, and she relaxed.Tears were in her eyes, but
he did not see them."I can't," she repeated, with a sob."You're not crying, little girl,
are you?""I'll not say anything more to-night.I'm leaving to-morrow, but I'll see you
again.I'll do anything
in reason to make it easy for you, but I can't, do you hear?""Here's where you get out," he said, as the carriage drew up near
the corner.He could see the evening lamp gleaming behind the Gerhardt
cottage curtains."Good-by," he said as she stepped out."Remember," he said, "this is just the beginning."Jennie stepped into the house weary, discouraged, ashamed.There was no denying that she had compromised herself
irretrievably.CHAPTER XIX


The inconclusive nature of this interview, exciting as it was, did
not leave any doubt in either Lester Kane's or Jennie's mind;
certainly this was not the end of the affair.Kane knew that he was
deeply fascinated.She was sweeter than he had
had any idea of.Her hesitancy, her repeated protests, her gentle "no,
no, no" moved him as music might.Depend upon it, this girl was for
him, and he would get her.What did he
care about what his family or the world might think?It was curious that Kane held the well-founded idea that in time
Jennie would yield to him physically, as she had already done
spiritually.Something about her--a
warm womanhood, a guileless expression of countenance--intimated
a sympathy toward sex relationship which had nothing to do with hard,
brutal immorality.She was the kind of a woman who was made for a
man--one man.All her attitude toward sex was bound up with love,
tenderness, service.When the one man arrived she would love him and
she would go to him.She would yield to him because he was the one man.On Jennie's part there was a great sense of complication and of
possible disaster.If he followed her of course he would learn all.She had not told him about Brander, because she was still under the
vague illusion that, in the end, she might escape.When she left him
she knew that he would come back.She knew, in spite of herself that
she wanted him to do so.Yet she felt that she must not yield, she
must go on leading her straitened, humdrum life.This was her
punishment for having made a mistake.She had made her bed, and she
must lie on it.The Kane family mansion at Cincinnati to which Lester returned
after leaving Jennie was an imposing establishment, which contrasted
strangely with the Gerhardt home.It was a great, rambling, two-story
affair, done after the manner of the French chateaux, but in red brick
and brownstone.It was set down, among flowers and trees, in an almost
park-like inclosure, and its very stones spoke of a splendid dignity
and of a refined luxury.Old Archibald Kane, the father, had amassed a
tremendous fortune, not by grabbing and brow-beating and unfair
methods, but by seeing a big need and filling it.Early in life he had
realized that America was a growing country.There was going to be a
big demand for vehicles--wagons, carriages, drays--and he
knew that some one would have to supply them.Having founded a small
wagon industry, he had built it up into a great business; he made good
wagons, and he sold them at a good profit.It was his theory that most
men were honest; he believed that at bottom they wanted honest things,
and if you gave them these they would buy of you, and come back and
buy again and again, until you were an influential and rich man.He
believed in the measure "heaped full and running over."All through
his life and now in his old age he enjoyed the respect and approval of
every one who knew him."Archibald Kane," you would hear his
competitors say, "Ah, there is a fine man.This man was the father of two sons and three daughters, all
healthy, all good-looking, all blessed with exceptional minds, but
none of them so generous and forceful as their long-living and
big-hearted sire.Robert, the eldest, a man forty years of age, was
his father's right-hand man in financial matters, having a certain
hard incisiveness which fitted him for the somewhat sordid details of
business life.He was of medium height, of a rather spare build, with
a high forehead, slightly inclined to baldness, bright, liquid-blue
eyes, an eagle nose, and thin, firm, even lips.He was a man of few
words, rather slow to action and of deep thought.He sat close to his
father as vice-president of the big company which occupied two whole
blocks in an outlying section of the city.He was a strong man--a
coming man, as his father well knew.Lester, the second boy, was his father's favorite.He was not by
any means the financier that Robert was, but he had a larger vision of
the subtleties that underlie life.He was softer, more human, more
good-natured about everything.And, strangely enough, old Archibald
admired and trusted him.Perhaps he
turned to Robert when it was a question of some intricate financial
problem, but Lester was the most loved as a son.Then there was Amy, thirty-two years of age, married, handsome, the
mother of one child--a boy; Imogene, twenty-eight, also married,
but as yet without children, and Louise, twenty-five, single, the
best-looking of the girls, but also the coldest and most critical.She
was the most eager of all for social distinction, the most vigorous of
all in her love of family prestige, the most desirous that the Kane
family should outshine every other.She was proud to think that the
family was so well placed socially, and carried herself with an air
and a hauteur which was sometimes amusing, sometimes irritating to
Lester!He liked her--in a way she was his favorite
sister--but he thought she might take herself with a little less
seriousness and not do the family standing any harm.Kane, the mother, was a quiet, refined woman, sixty years of
age, who, having come up from comparative poverty with her husband,
cared but little for social life.But she loved her children and her
husband, and was naively proud of their position and attainments.It
was enough for her to shine only in their reflected glory.A good
woman, a good wife, and a good mother.Lester arrived at Cincinnati early in the evening, and drove at
once to his home.An old Irish servitor met him at the door.Lester," he began, joyously, "sure I'm glad to see you
back.Yes, yes, it's been fine weather we're
having.Yes, yes, the family's all well.Sure your sister Amy is just
after leavin' the house with the boy.Your mother's up-stairs in her
room.Lester smiled cheerily and went up to his mother's room.In this,
which was done in white and gold and overlooked the garden to the
south and east, sat Mrs.Kane, a subdued, graceful, quiet woman, with
smoothly laid gray hair.She looked up when the door opened, laid down
the volume that she had been reading, and rose to greet him."There you are, Mother," he said, putting his arms around her and
kissing her."Oh, I'm just about the same, Lester.I was up with the Bracebridges for a few days again.I had
to stop off in Cleveland to see Parsons.She doesn't change any that I can see.She's just
as interested in entertaining as she ever was.""She's a bright girl," remarked his mother, recalling Mrs."She hasn't lost any of that, I can tell you," replied Lester
significantly.Kane smiled and went on to speak of various family
happenings.Old Zwingle, the yard
watchman at the factory, who had been with Mr.Kane for over forty
years, had died.Lester listened
dutifully, albeit a trifle absently.Lester, as he walked down the hall, encountered Louise."Smart" was
the word for her.She was dressed in a beaded black silk dress,
fitting close to her form, with a burst of rubies at her throat which
contrasted effectively with her dark complexion and black hair."Oh, there you are, Lester," she exclaimed.I'm going out, and I'm all fixed, even to
the powder on my nose.Lester had gripped her firmly
and kissed her soundly."I didn't brush much of it off," he said."You can always dust more
on with that puff of yours."He passed on to his own room to dress for
dinner.Dressing for dinner was a custom that had been adopted by the
Kane family in the last few years.Guests had become so common that in
a way it was a necessity, and Louise, in particular, made a point of
it.To-night Robert was coming, and a Mr.Burnett, old
friends of his father and mother, and so, of course, the meal would be
a formal one.Lester knew that his father was around somewhere, but he
did not trouble to look him up now.He was thinking of his last two
days in Cleveland and wondering when he would see Jennie again.CHAPTER XX


As Lester came down-stairs after making his toilet he found his
father in the library reading."Hello, Lester," he said, looking up from his paper over the top of
his glasses and extending his hand."Cleveland," replied his son, shaking hands heartily, and
smiling."Robert tells me you've been to New York.""How did you find my old friend Arnold?""I suppose not," said Archibald Kane genially, as if the report
were a compliment to his own hardy condition."He's been a temperate
man.He led the way back to the sitting-room where they chatted over
business and home news until the chime of the clock in the hall warned
the guests up-stairs that dinner had been served.Lester sat down in great comfort amid the splendors of the great
Louis Quinze dining-room.He liked this homey home
atmosphere--his mother and father and his sisters--the old
family friends.Louise announced that the Leverings were going to give a dance on
Tuesday, and inquired whether he intended to go."You know I don't dance," he returned dryly.If Robert is willing to dance occasionally I think you
might.""Robert's got it on me in lightness," Lester replied, airily."Be that as it may," said Lester."Don't try to stir up a fight, Louise," observed Robert,
sagely.After dinner they adjourned to the library, and Robert talked with
his brother a little on business.There were some contracts coming up
for revision.He wanted to see what suggestions Lester had to make.Louise was going to a party, and the carriage was now announced."Letty Pace asked about you the other night," Louise called back
from the door."She's a nice girl, Lester," put in his father, who was standing
near the open fire."I only wish you would marry her and settle down.asked Lester jocularly--"a conspiracy?You
know I'm not strong on the matrimonial business.""And I well know it," replied his mother semi-seriously.He really could not stand for this sort
of thing any more, he told himself.And as he thought his mind
wandered back to Jennie and her peculiar "Oh no, no!"That was a type of womanhood worth
while.Not sophisticated, not self-seeking, not watched over and set
like a man-trap in the path of men, but a sweet little
girl--sweet as a flower, who was without anybody, apparently, to
watch over her.That night in his room he composed a letter, which he
dated a week later, because he did not want to appear too urgent and
because he could not again leave Cincinnati for at least two
weeks."MY DEAR JENNIE, Although it has been a week, and I have said
nothing, I have not forgotten you--believe me.Was the impression
I gave of myself very bad?I will make it better from now on, for I
love you, little girl--I really do.There is a flower on my table
which reminds me of you very much--white, delicate, beautiful.Your personality, lingering with me, is just that.You are the essence
of everything beautiful to me.It is in your power to strew flowers in
my path if you will."But what I want to say here is that I shall be in Cleveland on the
18th, and I shall expect to see you.I arrive Thursday night, and I
want you to meet me in the ladies' parlor of the Dornton at noon
Friday."You see, I respect your suggestion that I should not call.These separations are dangerous to good
friendship.But I can't take "no" for an answer, not now."She's a remarkable girl in
her way," he thought.CHAPTER XXI


The arrival of this letter, coming after a week of silence and
after she had had a chance to think, moved Jennie deeply.How did she truly feel about this
man?If she did so, what
should she say?Heretofore all her movements, even the one in which
she had sought to sacrifice herself for the sake of Bass in Columbus,
had not seemed to involve any one but herself.Now, there seemed to be
others to consider--her family, above all, her child.The little
Vesta was now eighteen months of age; she was an interesting child;
her large, blue eyes and light hair giving promise of a comeliness
which would closely approximate that of her mother, while her mential
traits indicated a clear and intelligent mind.Gerhardt had
become very fond of her.Gerhardt had unbended so gradually that his
interest was not even yet clearly discernible, but he had a distinct
feeling of kindliness toward her.And this readjustment of her
father's attitude had aroused in Jennie an ardent desire to so conduct
herself that no pain should ever come to him again.Any new folly on
her part would not only be base ingratitude to her father, but would
tend to injure the prospects of her little one.Her life was a
failure, she fancied, but Vesta's was a thing apart; she must do
nothing to spoil it.She wondered whether it would not be better to
write Lester and explain everything.She had told him that she did not
wish to do wrong.Suppose she went on to inform him that she had a
child, and beg him to leave her in peace.Did she really want him to take her at her word?The need of making this confession was a painful thing to Jennie.It caused her to hesitate, to start a letter in which she tried to
explain, and then to tear it up.Finally, fate intervened in the
sudden home-coming of her father, who had been seriously injured by an
accident at the glass-works in Youngstown where he worked.It was on a Wednesday afternoon, in the latter part of August, when
a letter came from Gerhardt.But instead of the customary fatherly
communication, written in German and inclosing the regular weekly
remittance of five dollars, there was only a brief note, written by
another hand, and explaining that the day before Gerhardt had received
a severe burn on both hands, due to the accidental overturning of a
dipper of molten glass.The letter added that he would be home the
next morning.exclaimed William, his mouth wide
open.said Veronica, tears welling up in her eyes.Gerhardt sat down, clasped her hands in her lap, and stared at
the floor.The possibility
that Gerhardt was disabled for life opened long vistas of difficulties
which she had not the courage to contemplate.Bass came home at half-past six and Jennie at eight.The former
heard the news with an astonished face."Did the letter say
how bad he was hurt?""Well, I wouldn't worry about it," said Bass easily.I wouldn't worry like that if I
were you."The truth was, he wouldn't, because his nature was wholly
different.His brain was
not large enough to grasp the significance and weigh the results of
things."I
can't help it, though.To think that just when we were getting along
fairly well this new calamity should be added.It seems sometimes as
if we were under a curse.When Jennie came her mother turned to her instinctively; here was
her one stay.asked Jennie as she opened the door and
observed her mother's face.Gerhardt looked at her, and then turned half away."Pa's had his hands burned," put in Bass solemnly."He'll be home
to-morrow."Jennie looked at her mother, and her eyes dimmed with tears.Instinctively she ran to her and put her arms around her."Now, don't you cry, ma," she said, barely able to control herself.I know how you feel, but we'll get along.Then her own lips lost their evenness, and she struggled long
before she could pluck up courage to contemplate this new disaster.And now without volition upon her part there leaped into her
consciousness a new and subtly persistent thought.What about Lester's
offer of assistance now?Somehow
it came back to her--his affection, his personality, his desire
to help her, his sympathy, so like that which Brander had shown when
Bass was in jail.She thought
this over as she looked at her mother sitting there so silent,
haggard, and distraught."What a pity," she thought, "that her mother
must always suffer!Wasn't it a shame that she could never have any
real happiness?""I wouldn't feel so badly," she said, after a time."Maybe pa isn't
burned so badly as we think.Did the letter say he'd be home in the
morning?"They talked more quietly from now on, and gradually, as the details
were exhausted, a kind of dumb peace settled down upon the
household."One of us ought to go to the train to meet him in the morning,"
said Jennie to Bass."No," said Bass gloomily, "you mustn't.He was sour at this new fling of fate, and he looked his feelings;
he stalked off gloomily to his room and shut himself in.Jennie and
her mother saw the others off to bed, and then sat out in the kitchen
talking."I don't see what's to become of us now," said Mrs.Gerhardt at
last, completely overcome by the financial complications which this
new calamity had brought about.She looked so weak and helpless that
Jennie could hardly contain herself."Don't worry, mamma dear," she said, softly, a peculiar resolve
coming into her heart.There was comfort and ease
in it scattered by others with a lavish hand.Surely, surely
misfortune could not press so sharply but that they could live!She sat down with her mother, the difficulties of the future
seeming to approach with audible and ghastly steps."What do you suppose will become of us now?"repeated her mother,
who saw how her fanciful conception of this Cleveland home had
crumbled before her eyes."Why," said Jennie, who saw clearly and knew what could be done,
"it will be all right.She realized, as she sat there, that fate had shifted the burden of
the situation to her.She must sacrifice herself; there was no other
way.Bass met his father at the railway station in the morning.He
looked very pale, and seemed to have suffered a great deal.His cheeks
were slightly sunken and his bony profile appeared rather gaunt.His
hands were heavily bandaged, and altogether he presented such a
picture of distress that many stopped to look at him on the way home
from the station."By chops," he said to Bass, "that was a burn I got.I thought once
I couldn't stand the pain any longer.He related just how the accident had occurred, and said that he did
not know whether he would ever be able to use his hands again.The
thumb on his right hand and the first two fingers on the left had been
burned to the bone.The latter had been amputated at the first
joint--the thumb he might save, but his hands would be in danger
of being stiff.he added, "just at the time when I needed the money
most.Gerhardt opened the door, the
old mill-worker, conscious of her voiceless sympathy, began to cry.Even Bass lost control of himself for a
moment or two, but quickly recovered.The other children wept, until
Bass called a halt on all of them."Don't cry now," he said cheeringly.It
isn't so bad as all that.Bass's words had a soothing effect, temporarily, and, now that her
husband was home, Mrs.Though his
hands were bandaged, the mere fact that he could walk and was not
otherwise injured was some consolation.He might recover the use of
his hands and be able to undertake light work again.Anyway, they
would hope for the best.When Jennie came home that night she wanted to run to her father
and lay the treasury of her services and affection at his feet, but
she trembled lest he might be as cold to her as formerly.Never had he completely recovered from
the shame which his daughter had brought upon him.Although he wanted
to be kindly, his feelings were so tangled that he hardly knew what to
say or do."Papa," said Jennie, approaching him timidly.Gerhardt looked confused and tried to say something natural, but it
was unavailing.The thought of his helplessness, the knowledge of her
sorrow and of his own responsiveness to her affection--it was all
too much for him; he broke down again and cried helplessly."Forgive me, papa," she pleaded, "I'm so sorry.He did not attempt to look at her, but in the swirl of feeling that
their meeting created he thought that he could forgive, and he
did."I have prayed," he said brokenly.When he recovered himself he felt ashamed of his emotion, but a new
relationship of sympathy and of understanding had been established.From that time, although there was always a great reserve between
them, Gerhardt tried not to ignore her completely, and she endeavored
to show him the simple affection of a daughter, just as in the old
days.But while the household was again at peace, there were other cares
and burdens to be faced.How were they to get along now with five
dollars taken from the weekly budget, and with the cost of Gerhardt's
presence added?Bass might have contributed more of his weekly
earnings, but he did not feel called upon to do it.And so the small
sum of nine dollars weekly must meet as best it could the current
expenses of rent, food, and coal, to say nothing of incidentals, which
now began to press very heavily.Gerhardt had to go to a doctor to
have his hands dressed daily.Either more money must come from some source or the family must beg
for credit and suffer the old tortures of want.The situation
crystallized the half-formed resolve in Jennie's mind.Had he not tried to force money
on her?She finally decided that it was her duty to avail herself of
this proffered assistance.She sat down and wrote him a brief note.She would meet him as he had requested, but he would please not come
to the house.She mailed the letter, and then waited, with mingled
feelings of trepidation and thrilling expectancy, the arrival of the
fateful day.CHAPTER XXII


The fatal Friday came, and Jennie stood face to face with this new
and overwhelming complication in her modest scheme of existence.There
was really no alternative, she thought.If she could make her family happy, if she could
give Vesta a good education, if she could conceal the true nature of
this older story and keep Vesta in the background perhaps,
perhaps--well, rich men had married poor girls before this, and
Lester was very kind, he certainly liked her.At seven o'clock she
went to Mrs.Bracebridge's; at noon she excused herself on the pretext
of some work for her mother and left the house for the hotel.Lester, leaving Cincinnati a few days earlier than he expected, had
failed to receive her reply; he arrived at Cleveland feeling sadly out
of tune with the world.He had a lingering hope that a letter from
Jennie might be awaiting him at the hotel, but there was no word from
her.He was a man not easily wrought up, but to-night he felt
depressed, and so went gloomily up to his room and changed his linen.After supper he proceeded to drown his dissatisfaction in a game of
billiards with some friends, from whom he did not part until he had
taken very much more than his usual amount of alcoholic stimulant.The
next morning he arose with a vague idea of abandoning the whole
affair, but as the hours elapsed and the time of his appointment drew
near he decided that it might not be unwise to give her one last
chance.Accordingly, when it still lacked a quarter of
an hour of the time, he went down into the parlor.Great was his
delight when he beheld her sitting in a chair and waiting--the
outcome of her acquiescence.He walked briskly up, a satisfied,
gratified smile on his face."So you did come after all," he said, gazing at her with the look
of one who has lost and recovered a prize."What do you mean by not
writing me?I thought from the way you neglected me that you had made
up your mind not to come at all."What's the
trouble, Jennie?Nothing gone wrong out at your house, has there?"Yet it opened the door to what she wanted to say."He burned his hands at the glass-works.It looks as though he would not be able to use them any
more."She paused, looking the distress she felt, and he saw plainly that
she was facing a crisis.I've been wanting to get a better understanding of your family
affairs ever since I left."He led the way into the dining-room and
selected a secluded table.He tried to divert her mind by asking her
to order the luncheon, but she was too worried and too shy to do so
and he had to make out the menu by himself.Then he turned to her with
a cheering air."Now, Jennie," he said, "I want you to tell me all
about your family.I got a little something of it last time, but I
want to get it straight.Your father, you said, was a glass-blower by
trade.Now he can't work any more at that, that's obvious.""He's a clerk in a cigar store.""I think it's twelve dollars," she replied thoughtfully."Martha and Veronica don't do anything yet.He gets three
dollars and a half."He stopped, figuring up mentally just what they had to live on.He turned a fork in his hands back and forth; he was thinking
earnestly."To tell you the honest truth, I fancied it was something like
that, Jennie," he said."I've been thinking about you a lot.There's only one answer to your problem, and it isn't such a bad
one, if you'll only believe me."He paused for an inquiry, but she
made none."I thought I wouldn't," she said simply."I knew what you thought," he replied.I'm
going to 'tend to that family of yours.And I'll do it right now while
I think of it."He drew out his purse and extracted several ten and twenty-dollar
bills--two hundred and fifty dollars in all."I want you to take
this," he said.I will see that your family
is provided for from now on.She put it out in answer to the summons of his eyes, and he shut
her fingers on the money, pressing them gently at the same time."I
want you to have it, sweet.I'm not going to
see you suffer, nor any one belonging to you."Her eyes looked a dumb thankfulness, and she bit her lips."I don't know how to thank you," she said."You don't need to," he replied."The thanks are all the other
way--believe me."He paused and looked at her, the beauty of her face holding him.She looked at the table, wondering what would come next."How would you like to leave what you're doing and stay at home?""That would give you your freedom day times.""I couldn't do that," she replied."But there's so little in what
you're doing.I would be glad to
give you fifty times that sum if I thought there was any way in which
you could use it."He idly thrummed the cloth with his fingers.From the way she said it he judged there must be some bond of
sympathy between her and her mother which would permit of a confidence
such as this.He was by no means a hard man, and the thought touched
him."There's only one thing to be done, as far as I can see," he went
on very gently."You're not suited for the kind of work you're doing.Give it up and come with me down
to New York; I'll take good care of you.As
far as your family is concerned, you won't have to worry about them
any more.You can take a nice home for them and furnish it in any
style you please.He paused, and Jennie's thoughts reverted quickly to her mother,
her dear mother.Gerhardt had been talking of
this very thing--a nice home.If they could just have a larger
house, with good furniture and a yard filled with trees, how happy she
would be.In such a home she would be free of the care of rent, the
discomfort of poor furniture, the wretchedness of poverty; she would
be so happy.She hesitated there while his keen eye followed her in
spirit, and he saw what a power he had set in motion.It had been a
happy inspiration--the suggestion of a decent home for the
family.He waited a few minutes longer, and then said:

"Well, wouldn't you better let me do that?""It would be very nice," she said, "but it can't be done now.Papa would want to know all about where I was
going."Why couldn't you pretend that you are going down to New York with
Mrs."There couldn't be any objection to
that, could there?""Not if they didn't find out," she said, her eyes opening in
amazement.Plenty of mistresses take their maids on long
trips.Why not simply tell them you're invited to go--have to
go--and then go?"She thought it over, and the plan did seem feasible.Then she
looked at this man and realized that relationship with him meant
possible motherhood for her again.The tragedy of giving birth to a
child--ah, she could not go through that a second time, at least
under the same conditions.She could not bring herself to tell him
about Vesta, but she must voice this insurmountable objection."I--" she said, formulating the first word of her sentence,
and then stopping.He loved her shy ways, her sweet, hesitating lips.He reached over and laid his strong
brown one on top of it."I couldn't have a baby," she said, finally, and looked down.He gazed at her, and the charm of her frankness, her innate decency
under conditions so anomalous, her simple unaffected recognition of
the primal facts of life lifted her to a plane in his esteem which she
had not occupied until that moment."You're a great girl, Jennie," he said.You don't need to have a
child unless you want to, and I don't want you to."He saw the question written in her wondering, shamed face.You think I know,
don't you?"But anyway, I wouldn't let any trouble come to you.There wouldn't
be any satisfaction in that proposition for me at this time.But there won't be--don't worry."Not for worlds could she have met his
eyes."Look here, Jennie," he said, after a time."You care for me, don't
you?You don't think I'd sit here and plead with you if I didn't care
for you?I'm crazy about you, and that's the literal truth.I want you to do it
quickly.I know how difficult this family business is, but you can
arrange it.We'll pretend a courtship, anything you
like--only come now.""You don't mean right away, do you?"Bracebridge asked you you'd go fast enough, and no one would
think anything about it."It's always so much harder to work out a falsehood," she replied
thoughtfully."I know it, but you can come."Won't you wait a little while?""Not a day, sweet, that I can help."Yes," she replied sorrowfully, and yet with a strange thrill of
affection.CHAPTER XXIII


The business of arranging for this sudden departure was really not
so difficult as it first appeared.Jennie proposed to tell her mother
the whole truth, and there was nothing to say to her father except
that she was going with Mrs.He
might question her, but he really could not doubt Before going home
that afternoon she accompanied Lester to a department store, where she
was fitted out with a trunk, a suit-case, and a traveling suit and
hat."When we get to New York I am
going to get you some real things," he told her."I am going to show
you what you can be made to look like."He had all the purchased
articles packed in the trunk and sent to his hotel.Then he arranged
to have Jennie come there and dress Monday for the trip which began in
the afternoon.Gerhardt, who was in the kitchen, received
her with her usual affectionate greeting."No," she said, "I'm not tired."Oh, I have to tell you something, mamma.She
paused, looking inquiringly at her mother, and then away.So many things had
happened in the past that she was always on the alert for some new
calamity."You haven't lost your place, have you?""No," replied Jennie, with an effort to maintain her mental poise,
"but I'm going to leave it.""Why, when did you decide to do
that?""Yes, I do, mamma.I've got something I want to tell you.There isn't any way we can make things come
out right.I have found some one who wants to help us.He says he
loves me, and he wants me to go to New York with him Monday.You wouldn't do
anything like that after all that's happened."I've thought it all out," went on Jennie, firmly.He
wants me to go with him, and I'd better go.He will take a new house
for us when we come back and help us to get along.No one will ever
have me as a wife--you know that."I thought I'd better not tell him
about her.She oughtn't to be brought into it if I can help it.""I'm afraid you're storing up trouble for yourself, Jennie," said
her mother."Don't you think he is sure to find it out some time?""I thought maybe that she could be kept here," suggested Jennie,
"until she's old enough to go to school.Then maybe I could send her
somewhere.""She might," assented her mother; "but don't you think it would be
better to tell him now?He won't think any the worse of you.""I don't want
her to be brought into it.""Oh, it's been almost two months now.""And you never said anything about him," protested Mrs."I didn't know that he cared for me this way," said Jennie
defensively."Why didn't you wait and let him come out here first?"You can't go and not have
your father find out.""I thought I'd say I was going with Mrs.Papa can't
object to my going with her."Gerhardt, with her
imaginative nature, endeavored to formulate some picture of this new
and wonderful personality that had come into Jennie's life.He was
wealthy; he wanted to take Jennie; he wanted to give them a good home."And he gave me this," put in Jennie, who, with some instinctive
psychic faculty, had been following her mother's mood.She opened her
dress at the neck, and took out the two hundred and fifty dollars; she
placed the money in her mother's hands.Here was the relief for all her
woes--food, clothes, rent, coal--all done up in one small
package of green and yellow bills.If there were plenty of money in
the house Gerhardt need not worry about his burned hands; George and
Martha and Veronica could be clothed in comfort and made happy.Jennie could dress better; there would be a future education for
Vesta."Do you think he might ever want to marry you?""I don't know," replied Jennie "he might."Well," said her mother after a long pause, "if you're going to
tell your father you'd better do it right away.He'll think it's
strange as it is."Her mother had acquiesced from
sheer force of circumstances.She was sorry, but somehow it seemed to
be for the best."I'll help you out with it," her mother had
concluded, with a little sigh.The difficulty of telling this lie was very great for Mrs.Gerhardt, but she went through the falsehood with a seeming
nonchalance which allayed Gerhardt's suspicions.The children were
also told, and when, after the general discussion, Jennie repeated the
falsehood to her father it seemed natural enough."How long do you think you'll be gone?""About two or three weeks," she replied."That's a nice trip," he said."I came through New York in 1844.It
was a small place then compared to what it is now."Secretly he was pleased that Jennie should have this fine chance.When Monday came Jennie bade her parents good-by and left early,
going straight to the Dornton, where Lester awaited her."So you came," he said gaily, greeting her as she entered the
ladies' parlor."You are my niece," he went on."I have engaged H room for you near
mine.I'll call for the key, and you go dress.When you're ready I'll
have the trunk sent to the depot.The train leaves at one
o'clock."She went to her room and dressed, while he fidgeted about, read,
smoked, and finally knocked at her door.She replied by opening to him, fully clad."You look charming," he said with a smile.She looked down, for she was nervous and distraught.The whole
process of planning, lying, nerving herself to carry out her part had
been hard on her.He took her in his arms and kissed her, and they strolled down
the hall.He was astonished to see how well she looked in even these
simple clothes--the best she had ever had.They reached the depot after a short carriage ride.The
accommodations had been arranged for before hand, and Kane had allowed
just enough time to make the train.When they settled themselves in a
Pullman state-room it was with a keen sense of satisfaction on his
part.He had succeeded in
what he had started out to do.As the train rolled out of the depot and the long reaches of the
fields succeeded Jennie studied them wistfully.There were the
forests, leafless and bare; the wide, brown fields, wet with the rains
of winter; the low farm-houses sitting amid flat stretches of prairie,
their low roofs making them look as if they were hugging the ground.The train roared past little hamlets, with cottages of white and
yellow and drab, their roofs blackened by frost and rain.Jennie noted
one in particular which seemed to recall the old neighborhood where
they used to live at Columbus; she put her handkerchief to her eyes
and began silently to cry."I hope you're not crying, are you, Jennie?"said

Lester, looking up suddenly from the letter he had been reading."Come, come," he went on as he saw a faint tremor shaking her.You'll never get along if
you act that way."She made no reply, and the depth of her silent grief filled him
with strange sympathies."Don't cry," he continued soothingly; "everything will be all
right.Jennie made a great effort to recover herself, and began to dry her
eyes."You don't want to give way like that," he continued."It doesn't
do you any good.I know how you feel about leaving home, but tears
won't help it any.It isn't as if you were going away for good, you
know.You care for me, don't
you, sweet?"Yes," she said, and managed to smile back at him.Lester returned to his correspondence and Jennie fell to thinking
of Vesta.It troubled her to realize that she was keeping this secret
from one who was already very dear to her.She knew that she ought to
tell Lester about the child, but she shrank from the painful
necessity.Perhaps later on she might find the courage to do it."I'll have to tell him something," she thought with a sudden
upwelling of feeling as regarded the seriousness of this duty."If I
don't do it soon and I should go and live with him and he should find
it out he would never forgive me.He might turn me out, and then where
would I go?She turned to contemplate him, a premonitory wave of terror
sweeping over her, but she only saw that imposing and comfort-loving
soul quietly reading his letters, his smoothly shaved red cheek and
comfortable head and body looking anything but militant or like an
avenging Nemesis.She was just withdrawing her gaze when he looked
up."Well, have you washed all your sins away?"The touch of fact in it made it
slightly piquant.He turned to some other topic, while she looked out of the window,
the realization that one impulse to tell him had proved unavailing
dwelling in her mind."I'll have to do it shortly," she thought, and
consoled herself with the idea that she would surely find courage
before long.Their arrival in New York the next day raised the important
question in Lester's mind as to where he should stop.New York was a
very large place, and he was not in much danger of encountering people
who would know him, but he thought it just as well not to take
chances.Accordingly he had the cabman drive them to one of the more
exclusive apartment hotels, where he engaged a suite of rooms; and
they settled themselves for a stay of two or three weeks.This atmosphere into which Jennie was now plunged was so wonderful,
so illuminating, that she could scarcely believe this was the same
world that she had inhabited before.Kane was no lover of vulgar
display.The appointments with which he surrounded himself were always
simple and elegant.He knew at a glance what Jennie needed, and bought
for her with discrimination and care.And Jennie, a woman, took a keen
pleasure in the handsome gowns and pretty fripperies that he lavished
upon her.Could this be really Jennie Gerhardt, the washerwoman's
daughter, she asked herself, as she gazed in her mirror at the figure
of a girl clad in blue velvet, with yellow French lace at her throat
and upon her arms?Could these be her feet, clad in soft shapely shoes
at ten dollars a pair, these her hands adorned with flashing jewels?And Lester had promised
that her mother would share in it.Tears sprang to her eyes at the
thought.It was Lester's pleasure in these days to see what he could do to
make her look like some one truly worthy of im.He exercised his most
careful judgment, and the result surprised even himself.People turned
in the halls, in the dining-rooms, and on the street to gaze at
Jennie."A stunning woman that man has with him," was a frequent
comment.Despite her altered state Jennie did not lose her judgment of life
or her sense of perspective or proportion.She felt as though life
were tentatively loaning her something which would be taken away after
a time.There was no pretty vanity in her bosom.Lester realized this
as he watched her."You're a big woman, in your way," he said.Life hasn't given you much of a deal up to
now."He wondered how he could justify this new relationship to his
family, should they chance to hear about it.If he should decide to
take a home in Chicago or St.Louis (there was such a thought running
in his mind) could he maintain it secretly?He was
half persuaded that he really, truly loved her.As the time drew near for their return he began to counsel her as
to her future course of action."You ought to find some way of
introducing me, as an acquaintance, to your father," he said.Then if you tell him you're going
to marry me he'll think nothing of it."Jennie thought of Vesta, and
trembled inwardly.But perhaps her father could be induced to remain
silent.Lester had made the wise suggestion that she should retain the
clothes she had worn in Cleveland in order that she might wear them
home when she reached there."There won't be any trouble about this
other stuff," he said."I'll have it cared for until we make some
other arrangement."It was all very simple and easy; he was a master
strategist.Jennie had written her mother almost daily since she had been East.She had inclosed little separate notes to be read by Mrs.In one she explained Lester's desire to call, and urged her
mother to prepare the way by telling her father that she had met some
one who liked her.She spoke of the difficulty concerning Vesta, and
her mother at once began to plan a campaign o have Gerhardt hold his
peace.Jennie must be given an opportunity
to better herself.Of
course she could not go back to her work, but Mrs.Bracebridge had given Jennie a few weeks' vacation in order
that she might look for something better, something at which he could
make more money.CHAPTER XXIV


The problem of the Gerhardt family and its relationship to himself
comparatively settled, Kane betook himself to Cincinnati and to his
business duties.He was heartily interested in the immense plant,
which occupied two whole blocks in the outskirts of the city, and its
conduct and development was as much a problem and a pleasure to him as
to either his father or his brother.He liked to feel that he was a
vital part of this great and growing industry.When he saw freight
cars going by on the railroads labelled "The Kane Manufacturing
Company--Cincinnati" or chanced to notice displays of the
company's products in the windows of carriage sales companies in the
different cities he was conscious of a warm glow of satisfaction.It
was something to be a factor in an institution so stable, so
distinguished, so honestly worth while.This was all very well, but
now Kane was entering upon a new phase of his personal
existence--in a word, there was Jennie.He was conscious as he
rode toward his home city that he was entering on a relationship which
might involve disagreeable consequences.He was a little afraid of his
father's attitude; above all, there was his brother Robert.Robert was cold and conventional in character; an excellent
business man; irreproachable in both his public and in his private
life.Never overstepping the strict boundaries of legal righteousness,
he was neither warm-hearted nor generous--in fact, he would turn
any trick which could be speciously, or at best necessitously,
recommended to his conscience.How he reasoned Lester did not
know--he could not follow the ramifications of a logic which
could combine hard business tactics with moral rigidity, but somehow
his brother managed to do it."He's got a Scotch Presbyterian
conscience mixed with an Asiatic perception of the main chance."Lester once told somebody, and he had the situation accurately
measured.Nevertheless he could not rout his brother from his
positions nor defy him, for he had the public conscience with him.He
was in line with convention practically, and perhaps
sophisticatedly.The two brothers were outwardly friendly; inwardly they were far
apart.Robert liked Lester well enough personally, but he did not
trust his financial judgment, and, temperamentally, they did not agree
as to how life and its affairs should be conducted.Lester had a
secret contempt for his brother's chill, persistent chase of the
almighty dollar.Robert was sure that Lester's easy-going ways were
reprehensible, and bound to create trouble sooner or later.In the
business they did not quarrel much--there was not so much chance
with the old gentleman still in charge--but there were certain
minor differences constantly cropping up which showed which way the
wind blew.Lester was for building up trade through friendly
relationship, concessions, personal contact, and favors.Robert was
for pulling everything tight, cutting down the cost of production, and
offering such financial inducements as would throttle competition.The old manufacturer always did his best to pour oil on these
troubled waters, but he foresaw an eventual clash.One or the other
would have to get out or perhaps both."If only you two boys could
agree!"Another thing which disturbed Lester was his father's attitude on
the subject of marriage--Lester's marriage, to be specific.Archibald Kane never ceased to insist on the fact that Lester ought to
get married, and that he was making a big mistake in putting it off.All the other children, save Louise, were safely married.It was doing him injury morally, socially, commercially,
that he was sure of."The world expects it of a man in your position," his father had
argued from time to time."It makes for social solidity and prestige.You ought to pick out a good woman and raise a family.Where will you
be when you get to my time of life if you haven't any children, any
home?""Well, if the right woman came along," said Lester, "I suppose I'd
marry her."No, not anybody, of course, but there are lots of good women.You
can surely find some one if you try.I wouldn't drift on this way, Lester;
it can't come to any good.""There, father, let it go now.I'll come
around some time, no doubt.I've got to be thirsty when I'm led to
water."The old gentleman gave over, time and again, but it was a sore
point with him.He wanted his son to settle down and be a real man of
affairs.The fact that such a situation as this might militate against any
permanent arrangement with Jennie was obvious even to Lester at this
time.Of course he
would not give Jennie up, whatever the possible consequences.But he
must be cautious; he must take no unnecessary risks.What a scandal if it were ever found out!Could he
install her in a nice home somewhere near the city?Could he take her along on his
numerous business journeys?This first one to New York had been
successful.He turned the question over in his
mind.Louis, or Pittsburg,
or Chicago would be best after all.He went to these places
frequently, and particularly to Chicago.He decided finally that it
should be Chicago if he could arrange it.He could always make excuses
to run up there, and it was only a night's ride.The very size and activity of the city made concealment easy.After two weeks' stay at Cincinnati Lester wrote Jennie that he was
coming to Cleveland soon, and she answered that she thought it would
be all right for him to call and see her.She had felt it unwise to stay about the house, and so had
secured a position in a store at four dollars a week.He smiled as he
thought of her working, and yet the decency and energy of it appealed
to him."She's the best I've come across
yet."He ran up to Cleveland the following Saturday, and, calling at her
place of business, he made an appointment to see her that evening.He
was anxious that his introduction, as her beau, should be gotten over
with as quickly as possible.When he did call the shabbiness of the
house and the manifest poverty of the family rather disgusted him, but
somehow Jennie seemed as sweet to him as ever.Gerhardt came in the
front-room, after he had been there a few minutes, and shook hands
with him, as did also Mrs.Gerhardt, but Lester paid little attention
to them.The old German appeared to him to be merely
commonplace--the sort of man who was hired by hundreds in common
capacities in his father's factory.After some desultory conversation
Lester suggested to Jennie that they should go for a drive.Jennie put
on her hat, and together they departed.As a matter of fact, they went
to an apartment which he had hired for the storage of her clothes.When she returned at eight in the evening the family considered it
nothing amiss.CHAPTER XXV


A month later Jennie was able to announce that Lester intended to
marry her.His visits had of course paved the way for this, and it
seemed natural enough.He did
not know just how this might be.Lester
seemed a fine enough man in all conscience, and really, after Brander,
why not?If a United States Senator could fall in love with Jennie,
why not a business man?"Has
she told him about Vesta?"Do you think he
wants her if he knows?That's what comes of such conduct in the first
place.Now she has to slip around like a thief.The child cannot even
have an honest name."Gerhardt went back to his newspaper reading and brooding.His life
seemed a complete failure to him and he was only waiting to get well
enough to hunt up another job as watchman.He wanted to get out of
this mess of deception and dishonesty.A week or two later Jennie confided to her mother that Lester had
written her to join him in Chicago.He was not feeling well, and could
not come to Cleveland.The two women explained to Gerhardt that Jennie
was going away to be married to Mr.Gerhardt flared up at this,
and his suspicions were again aroused.But he could do nothing but
grumble over the situation; it would lead to no good end, of that he
was sure.When the day came for Jennie's departure she had to go without
saying farewell to her father.He was out looking for work until late
in the afternoon, and before he had returned she had been obliged to
leave for the station."I will write a note to him when I get there,"
she said."Lester will take a
better house for us soon," she went on hopefully.The night train bore her to Chicago; the old life had ended and
the new one had begun.The curious fact should be recorded here that, although Lester's
generosity had relieved the stress upon the family finances, the
children and Gerhardt were actually none the wiser.Gerhardt to deceive her husband as to the purchase of necessities
and she had not as yet indulged in any of the fancies which an
enlarged purse permitted.But, after Jennie had
been in Chicago for a few days, she wrote to her mother saying that
Lester wanted them to take a new home.This letter was shown to
Gerhardt, who had been merely biding her return to make a scene.He
frowned, but somehow it seemed an evidence of regularity.If he had
not married her why should he want to help them?Perhaps Jennie was
well married after all.Perhaps she really had been lifted to a high
station in life, and was now able to help the family.Gerhardt almost
concluded to forgive her everything once and for all.The end of it was that a new house was decided upon, and Jennie
returned to Cleveland to help her mother move.Together they searched
the streets for a nice, quiet neighborhood, and finally found one.A
house of nine rooms, with a yard, which rented for thirty dollars, was
secured and suitably furnished.There were comfortable fittings for
the dining-room and sitting-room, a handsome parlor set and bedroom
sets complete for each room.The kitchen was supplied with every
convenience, and there was even a bath-room, a luxury the Gerhardts
had never enjoyed before.Altogether the house was attractive, though
plain, and Jennie was happy to know that her family could be
comfortable in it.When the time came for the actual moving Mrs.Gerhardt was fairly
beside herself with joy, for was not this the realization of her
dreams?All through the long years of her life she had been waiting,
and now it had come.A new house, new furniture, plenty of
room--things finer than she had ever even imagined--think of
it!Her eyes shone as she looked at the new beds and tables and
bureaus and whatnots."Dear, dear, isn't this nice!"Jennie smiled and tried to pretend satisfaction
without emotion, but there were tears in her eyes.She was so glad for
her mother's sake.She could have kissed Lester's feet for his
goodness to her family.Gerhardt, Martha, and
Veronica were on hand to clean and arrange things.At the sight of the
large rooms and pretty yard, bare enough in winter, but giving promise
of a delightful greenness in spring, and the array of new furniture
standing about in excelsior, the whole family fell into a fever of
delight.George rubbed his feet over
the new carpets and Bass examined the quality of the furniture
critically.Gerhardt roved to and fro
like a person in a dream.She could not believe that these bright
bedrooms, this beautiful parlor, this handsome dining-room were
actually hers.Although he tried hard not to show it,
he, too, could scarcely refrain from enthusiastic comment.The sight
of an opal-globed chandelier over the dining-room table was the
finishing touch.He looked grimly around, under his shaggy eyebrows, at the new
carpets under his feet, the long oak extension table covered with a
white cloth and set with new dishes, at the pictures on the walls, the
bright, clean kitchen.We want to be careful now
not to break anything.It's so easy to scratch things up, and then
it's all over."CHAPTER XXVI


It would be useless to chronicle the events of the three years that
followed--events and experiences by which the family grew from an
abject condition of want to a state of comparative self-reliance,
based, of course, on the obvious prosperity of Jennie and the
generosity (through her) of her distant husband.Lester was seen now
and then, a significant figure, visiting Cleveland, and sometimes
coming out to the house where he occupied with Jennie the two best
rooms of the second floor.There were hurried trips on her
part--in answer to telegraph massages--to Chicago, to St.One of his favorite pastimes was to engage
quarters at the great resorts--Hot Springs, Mt.Clemens,
Saratoga--and for a period of a week or two at a stretch enjoy
the luxury of living with Jennie as his wife.There were other times
when he would pass through Cleveland only for the privilege of seeing
her for a day.All the time he was aware that he was throwing on her
the real burden of a rather difficult situation, but he did not see
how he could remedy it at this time.He was not sure as yet that he
really wanted to.The attitude of the Gerhardt family toward this condition of
affairs was peculiar.At first, in spite of the irregularity of it, it
seemed natural enough.No one had seen
her marriage certificate, but she said so, and she seemed to carry
herself with the air of one who holds that relationship.Still, she
never went to Cincinnati, where his family lived, and none of his
relatives ever came near her.Then, too, his attitude, in spite of the
money which had first blinded them, was peculiar.He really did not
carry himself like a married man.There were
weeks in which she appeared to receive only perfunctory notes.There
were times when she would only go away for a few days to meet him.Then there were the long periods in which she absented
herself--the only worthwhile testimony toward a real
relationship, and that, in a way, unnatural.Bass, who had grown to be a young man of twenty-five, with some
business judgment and a desire to get out in the world, was
suspicious.He had come to have a pretty keen knowledge of life, and
intuitively he felt that things were not right.George, nineteen, who
had gained a slight foothold in a wall-paper factory and was looking
forward to a career in that field, was also restless.Martha, seventeen, was still in school, as were
William and Veronica.Each was offered an opportunity to study
indefinitely; but there was unrest with life.The neighbors were obviously drawing conclusions for
themselves.Gerhardt himself finally concluded
that there was something wrong, but he had let himself into this
situation, and was not in much of a position now to raise an argument.He wanted to ask her at times--proposed to make her do better if
he could--but the worst had already been done.It depended on the
man now, he knew that.Things were gradually nearing a state where a general upheaval
would have taken place had not life stepped in with one of its
fortuitous solutions.Although stout
and formerly of a fairly active disposition, she had of late years
become decidedly sedentary in her habits and grown weak, which,
coupled with a mind naturally given to worry, and weighed upon as it
had been by a number of serious and disturbing ills, seemed now to
culminate in a slow but very certain case of systemic poisoning.She
became decidedly sluggish in her motions, wearied more quickly at the
few tasks left for her to do, and finally complained to Jennie that it
was very hard for her to climb stairs."I'm not feeling well," she
said."I think I'm going to be sick."Jennie now took alarm and proposed to take her to some near-by
watering-place, but Mrs."I don't think it would
do any good," she said.She sat about or went driving with her
daughter, but the fading autumn scenery depressed her."I don't like
to get sick in the fall," she said."The leaves coming down make me
think I am never going to get well."said Jennie; but she felt frightened,
nevertheless.How much the average home depends upon the mother was seen when it
was feared the end was near.Bass, who had thought of getting married
and getting out of this atmosphere, abandoned the idea temporarily.Gerhardt, shocked and greatly depressed, hung about like one expectant
of and greatly awed by the possibility of disaster.Jennie, too
inexperienced in death to feel that she could possibly lose her
mother, felt as if somehow her living depended on her.Hoping in spite
of all opposing circumstances, she hung about, a white figure of
patience, waiting and serving.The end came one morning after a month of illness and several days
of unconsciousness, during which silence reigned in the house and all
the family went about on tiptoe.Gerhardt passed away with her
dying gaze fastened on Jennie's face for the last few minutes of
consciousness that life vouchsafed her.Jennie stared into her eyes
with a yearning horror.Gerhardt came running in from the yard, and, throwing himself down
by the bedside, wrung his bony hands in anguish.Gerhardt hastened the final breaking up of the
family.Bass was bent on getting married at once, having had a girl in
town for some time.Martha, whose views of life had broadened and
hardened, was anxious to get out also.She felt that a sort of stigma
attached to the home--to herself, in fact, so long as she
remained there.Martha looked to the public schools as a source of
income; she was going to be a teacher.Gerhardt alone scarcely knew
which way to turn.He was again at work as a night watchman.Jennie
found him crying one day alone in the kitchen, and immediately burst
into tears herself.she pleaded, "it isn't as bad as
that.You will always have a home--you know that--as long as
I have anything.He really did not want to go with her."It
isn't that," he continued.It was some little time before Bass, George and Martha finally
left, but, one by one, they got out, leaving Jennie, her father,
Veronica, and William, and one other--Jennie's child.Of course
Lester knew nothing of Vesta's parentage, and curiously enough he had
never seen the little girl.During the short periods in which he
deigned to visit the house--two or three days at most--Mrs.Gerhardt took good care that Vesta was kept in the background.There
was a play-room on the top floor, and also a bedroom there, and
concealment was easy.Lester rarely left his rooms, he even had his
meals served to him in what might have been called the living-room of
the suite.He was not at all inquisitive or anxious to meet any one of
the other members of the family.He was perfectly willing to shake
hands with them or to exchange a few perfunctory words, but
perfunctory words only.It was generally understood that the child
must not appear, and so it did not.There is an inexplicable sympathy between old age and childhood, an
affinity which is as lovely as it is pathetic.During that first year
in Lorrie Street, when no one was looking, Gerhardt often carried
Vesta about on his shoulders and pinched her soft, red cheeks.When
she got old enough to walk he it was who, with a towel fastened
securely under her arms, led her patiently around the room until she
was able to take a few steps of her own accord.When she actually
reached the point where she could walk he was the one who coaxed her
to the effort, shyly, grimly, but always lovingly.By some strange
leading of fate this stigma on his family's honor, this blotch on
conventional morality, had twined its helpless baby fingers about the
tendons of his heart.He loved this little outcast ardently,
hopefully.She was the one bright ray in a narrow, gloomy life, and
Gerhardt early took upon himself the responsibility of her education
in religious matters.Was it not he who had insisted that the infant
should be baptized?"Say 'Our Father,'" he used to demand of the lisping infant when he
had her alone with him."Ow Fowvaw," was her vowel-like interpretation of his words."'Ooh ah in aven,'" repeated the child.Gerhardt, overhearing
the little one's struggles with stubborn consonants and vowels."Because I want she should learn the Christian faith," returned
Gerhardt determinedly.If she don't
begin now she never will know them."Many of her husband's religious
idiosyncrasies were amusing to her.At the same time she liked to see
this sympathetic interest he was taking in the child's upbringing.If
he were only not so hard, so narrow at times.He made himself a
torment to himself and to every one else.On the earliest bright morning of returning spring he was wont to
take her for her first little journeys in the world."Come, now," he
would say, "we will go for a little walk."Gerhardt would fasten on one of her little hoods, for in these
days Jennie kept Vesta's wardrobe beautifully replete.Taking her by
the hand, Gerhardt would issue forth, satisfied to drag first one foot
and then the other in order to accommodate his gait to her toddling
steps.One beautiful May day, when Vesta was four years old, they started
on one of their walks.Everywhere nature was budding and bourgeoning;
the birds twittering their arrival from the south; the insects making
the best of their brief span of life.Sparrows chirped in the road;
robins strutted upon the grass; bluebirds built in the eaves of the
cottages.Gerhardt took a keen delight in pointing out the wonders of
nature to Vesta, and she was quick to respond.exclaimed Vesta, catching sight of a low,
flashing touch of red as a robin lighted upon a twig nearby.Her hand
was up, and her eyes were wide open."Yes," said Gerhardt, as happy as if he himself had but newly
discovered this marvelous creature."It is going to look for a worm now.We
will see if we cannot find its nest.I think I saw a nest in one of
these trees."He plodded peacefully on, seeking to rediscover an old abandoned
nest that he had observed on a former walk."Here it is," he said at
last, coming to a small and leafless tree, in which a winter-beaten
remnant of a home was still clinging."Here, come now, see," and he
lifted the baby up at arm's length."See," said Gerhardt, indicating the wisp of dead grasses with his
free hand, "nest.repeated Vesta, imitating his pointing finger with one of
her own."Yes," said Gerhardt, putting her down again."That was a wren's
nest.Still further they plodded, he unfolding the simple facts of life,
she wondering with the wide wonder of a child.When they had gone a
block or two he turned slowly about as if the end of the world had
been reached.And so she had come to her fifth year, growing in sweetness,
intelligence, and vivacity.Gerhardt was fascinated by the questions
she asked, the puzzles she pronounced."What is it she doesn't want to know?From rising in the morning, to dress her to laying her
down at night after she had said her prayers, she came to be the chief
solace and comfort of his days.Without Vesta, Gerhardt would have
found his life hard indeed to bear.CHAPTER XXVII


For three years now Lester had been happy in the companionship of
Jennie.Irregular as the connection might be in the eyes of the church
and of society, it had brought him peace and comfort, and he was
perfectly satisfied with the outcome of the experiment.His interest
in the social affairs of Cincinnati was now practically nil, and he
had consistently refused to consider any matrimonial proposition which
had himself as the object.He looked on his father's business
organization as offering a real chance for himself if he could get
control of it; but he saw no way of doing so.Robert's interests were
always in the way, and, if anything, the two brothers were farther
apart than ever in their ideas and aims.Lester had thought once or
twice of entering some other line of business or of allying himself
with another carriage company, but he did not feel that ha could
conscientiously do this.Lester had his salary--fifteen thousand
a year as secretary and treasurer of the company (his brother was
vice-president)--and about five thousand from some outside
investments.He had not been so lucky or so shrewd in speculation as
Robert had been; aside from the principal which yielded his five
thousand, he had nothing.Robert, on the other hand, was
unquestionably worth between three and four hundred thousand dollars,
in addition to his future interest in the business, which both
brothers shrewdly suspected would be divided somewhat in their favor.Robert and Lester would get a fourth each, they thought; their sisters
a sixth.It seemed natural that Kane senior should take this view,
seeing that the brothers were actually in control and doing the work.The old gentleman might do anything or
nothing.The probabilities were that he would be very fair and
liberal.At the same time, Robert was obviously beating Lester in the
game of life.There comes a time in every thinking man's life when he pauses and
"takes stock" of his condition; when he asks himself how it fares with
his individuality as a whole, mental, moral, physical, material.This
time comes after the first heedless flights of youth have passed, when
the initiative and more powerful efforts have been made, and he begins
to feel the uncertainty of results and final values which attaches
itself to everything.There is a deadening thought of uselessness
which creeps into many men's minds--the thought which has been
best expressed by the Preacher in Ecclesiastes.he used to say to himself, "whether I live at the White House,
or here at home, or at the Grand Pacific?"But in the very question
was the implication that there were achievements in life which he had
failed to realize in his own career.The White House represented the
rise and success of a great public character.His home and the Grand
Pacific were what had come to him without effort.He decided for the time being--it was about the period of the
death of Jennie's mother--that he would make some effort to
rehabilitate himself.He would cut out idling--these numerous
trips with Jennie had cost him considerable time.If his brother could find avenues of financial
profit, so could he.He would endeavor to assert his
authority--he would try to make himself of more importance in the
business, rather than let Robert gradually absorb everything.Should
he forsake Jennie?--that thought also, came to him.Somehow he did not see how it
could be done.It seemed cruel, useless; above all (though he disliked
to admit it) it would be uncomfortable for himself.He liked
her--loved her, perhaps, in a selfish way.He didn't see how he
could desert her very well.Just at this time he had a really serious difference with Robert.His brother wanted to sever relations with an old and well established
paint company in New York, which had manufactured paints especially
for the house, and invest in a new concern in Chicago, which was
growing and had a promising future.Lester, knowing the members of the
Eastern firm, their reliability, their long and friendly relations
with the house, was in opposition.His father at first seemed to agree
with Lester.But Robert argued out the question in his cold, logical
way, his blue eyes fixed uncompromisingly upon his brother's face."We
can't go on forever," he said, "standing by old friends, just because
father here has dealt with them, or you like them.The business must be stiffened up; we're going to have more
and stronger competition.""It's just as father feels about it," said Lester at last."I have
no deep feeling in the matter.It won't hurt me one way or the other.You say the house is going to profit eventually.I've stated the
arguments on the other side.""I'm inclined to think Robert is right," said Archibald Kane
calmly."Most of the things he has suggested so far have worked
out.""Well, we won't have any more discussion about it
then," he said.He rose and strolled out of the office.The shock of this defeat, coming at a time when he was considering
pulling himself together, depressed Lester considerably.It wasn't
much but it was a straw, and his father's remark about his brother's
business acumen was even more irritating.He was beginning to wonder
whether his father would discriminate in any way in the distribution
of the property.Had he heard anything about his entanglement with
Jennie?Had he resented the long vacations he had taken from business?It did not appear to Lester that he could be justly chargeable with
either incapacity or indifference, so far as the company was
concerned.He was still the investigator of
propositions put up to the house, the student of contracts, the
trusted adviser of his father and mother--but he was being
worsted.He thought about this, but could reach no
conclusion.Later in this same year Robert came forward with a plan for
reorganization in the executive department of the business.He
proposed that they should build an immense exhibition and storage
warehouse on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, and transfer a portion of
their completed stock there.Buyers from the West and country merchants could be more easily
reached and dealt with there.It would be a big advertisement for the
house, a magnificent evidence of its standing and prosperity.Kane
senior and Lester immediately approved of this.Robert suggested that Lester should undertake the
construction of the new buildings.It would probably be advisable for
him to reside in Chicago a part of the time.The idea appealed to Lester, even though it took him away from
Cincinnati, largely if not entirely.It was dignified and not
unrepresentative of his standing in the company.He could live in
Chicago and he could have Jennie with him.The scheme he had for
taking an apartment could now be arranged without difficulty."I'm sure we'll get good results from this all
around," he said.As construction work was soon to begin, Lester decided to move to
Chicago immediately.He sent word for Jennie to meet him, and together
they selected an apartment on the North Side, a very comfortable suite
of rooms on a side street near the lake, and he had it fitted up to
suit his taste.He figured that living in Chicago he could pose as a
bachelor.He would never need to invite his friends to his rooms.There were his offices, where he could always be found, his clubs and
the hotels.To his way of thinking the arrangement was practically
ideal.Of course Jennie's departure from Cleveland brought the affairs of
the Gerhardt family to a climax.Probably the home would be broken up,
but Gerhardt himself took the matter philosophically.He was an old
man, and it did not matter much where he lived.Bass, Martha, and
George were already taking care of themselves.Veronica and William
were still in school, but some provision could be made for boarding
them with a neighbor.The one real concern of Jennie and Gerhardt was
Vesta.It was Gerhardt's natural thought that Jennie must take the
child with her.he asked her, when the day of her
contemplated departure had been set."No; but I'm going to soon," she assured him."It's too bad," he went on.God will punish you,
I'm afraid.I'm getting old--otherwise
I would keep her.There is no one here all day now to look after her
right, as she should be.""I know," said Jennie weakly.I'm going
to have her live with me soon.I won't neglect her--you know
that.""But the child's name," he insisted.Soon
in another year she goes to school.People will want to know who she
is.Jennie understood well enough that it couldn't.The heaviest cross she had to bear was the constant
separations and the silence she was obliged to maintain about Vesta's
very existence.It did seem unfair to the child, and yet Jennie did
not see clearly how she could have acted otherwise.Vesta had good
clothes, everything she needed.Jennie
hoped to give her a good education.If only she had told the truth to
Lester in the first place.Now it was almost too late, and yet she
felt that she had acted for the best.Finally she decided to find some
good woman or family in Chicago who would take charge of Vesta for a
consideration.In a Swedish colony to the west of La Salle Avenue she
came across an old lady who seemed to embody all the virtues she
required--cleanliness, simplicity, honesty.She was a widow,
doing work by the day, but she was glad to make an arrangement by
which she should give her whole time to Vesta.The latter was to go to
kindergarten when a suitable one should be found.She was to have toys
and kindly attention, and Mrs.Olsen was to inform Jennie of any
change in the child's health.Jennie proposed to call every day, and
she thought that sometimes, when Lester was out of town, Vesta might
be brought to the apartment.She had had her with her at Cleveland,
and he had never found out anything.The arrangements completed, Jennie returned at the first
opportunity to Cleveland to take Vesta away.Gerhardt, who had been
brooding over his approaching loss, appeared most solicitous about her
future."She should grow up to be a fine girl," he said."You should
give her a good education--she is so smart."He spoke of the
advisability of sending her to a Lutheran school and church, but
Jennie was not so sure of that.Time and association with Lester had
led her to think that perhaps the public school was better than any
private institution.She had no particular objection to the church,
but she no longer depended upon its teachings as a guide in the
affairs of life.The next day it was necessary for Jennie to return to Chicago.Vesta, excited and eager, was made ready for the journey.Gerhardt had
been wandering about, restless as a lost spirit, while the process of
dressing was going on; now that the hour had actually struck he was
doing his best to control his feelings.He could see that the
five-year-old child had no conception of what it meant to him.She was
happy and self-interested, chattering about the ride and the
train."Be a good little girl," he said, lifting her up and kissing her."See that you study your catechism and say your prayers.And you won't
forget the grandpa--what?--" He tried to go on, but his
voice failed him.Jennie, whose heart ached for her father, choked back her emotion."There," she said, "if I'd thought you were going to act like
that--" She stopped."Go," said Gerhardt, manfully, "go.And he
stood solemnly by as they went out of the door.Then he turned back to
his favorite haunt, the kitchen, and stood there staring at the floor.One by one they were leaving him--Mrs.Gerhardt, Bass, Martha,
Jennie, Vesta.He clasped his hands together, after his old-time
fashion, and shook his head again and again.CHAPTER XXVIII


During the three years in which Jennie and Lester had been
associated there had grown up between them a strong feeling of mutual
sympathy and understanding.Lester truly loved her in his own way.It
was a strong, self-satisfying, determined kind of way, based solidly
on a big natural foundation, but rising to a plane of genuine
spiritual affinity.The yielding sweetness of her character both
attracted and held him.She was true, and good, and womanly to the
very center of her being; he had learned to trust her, to depend upon
her, and the feeling had but deepened with the passing of the
years.On her part Jennie had sincerely, deeply, truly learned to love
this man.At first when he had swept her off her feet, overawed her
soul, and used her necessity as a chain wherewith to bind her to him,
she was a little doubtful, a little afraid of him, although she had
always liked him.Now, however, by living with him, by knowing him
better, by watching his moods, she had come to love him.He was so
big, so vocal, so handsome.His point of view and opinions of anything
and everything were so positive.His pet motto, "Hew to the line, let
the chips fall where they may," had clung in her brain as something
immensely characteristic.Apparently he was not afraid of
anything--God, man, or devil.He used to look at her, holding her
chin between the thumb and fingers of his big brown hand, and say:
"You're sweet, all right, but you need courage and defiance.And her eyes would meet his in dumb
appeal."Never mind," he would add, "you have other things."One of the most appealing things to Lester was the simple way in
which she tried to avoid exposure of her various social and
educational shortcomings.She could not write very well, and once he
found a list of words he had used written out on a piece of paper with
the meanings opposite.He smiled, but he liked her better for it.Louis he watched her
pretending a loss of appetite because she thought that her lack of
table manners was being observed by nearby diners.She could not
always be sure of the right forks and knives, and the strange-looking
dishes bothered her; how did one eat asparagus and artichokes?"You're
hungry, aren't you?"I wouldn't bring you here if
they weren't.I'd tell
you quick enough when there was anything wrong."His brown eyes held a
friendly gleam."I do feel a little nervous at times," she
admitted.By degrees Jennie grew into an understanding of the usages and
customs of comfortable existence.All that the Gerhardt family had
ever had were the bare necessities of life.Now she was surrounded
with whatever she wanted--trunks, clothes, toilet articles, the
whole varied equipment of comfort--and while she liked it all, it
did not upset her sense of proportion and her sense of the fitness of
things.There was no element of vanity in her, only a sense of joy in
privilege and opportunity.She was grateful to Lester for all that he
had done and was doing for her.If only she could hold
him--always!The details of getting Vesta established once adjusted, Jennie
settled down into the routine of home life.Lester, busy about his
multitudinous affairs, was in and out.He had a suite of rooms
reserved for himself at the Grand Pacific, which was then the
exclusive hotel of Chicago, and this was his ostensible residence.His
luncheon and evening appointments were kept at the Union Club.An
early patron of the telephone, he had one installed in the apartment,
so that he could reach Jennie quickly and at any time.He was home two
or three nights a week, sometimes oftener.He insisted at first on
Jennie having a girl of general housework, but acquiesced in the more
sensible arrangement which she suggested later of letting some one
come in to do the cleaning.Her
natural industry and love of order prompted this feeling.Lester liked his breakfast promptly at eight in the morning.He
wanted dinner served nicely at seven.Silverware, cut glass, imported
china--all the little luxuries of life appealed to him.He kept
his trunks and wardrobe at the apartment.He was in the
habit of taking Jennie to the theater now and then, and if he chanced
to run across an acquaintance he always introduced her as Miss
Gerhardt.When he registered her as his wife it was usually under an
assumed name; where there was no danger of detection he did not mind
using his own signature.Thus far there had been no difficulty or
unpleasantness of any kind.The trouble with this situation was that it was criss-crossed with
the danger and consequent worry which the deception in regard to Vesta
had entailed, as well as with Jennie's natural anxiety about her
father and the disorganized home.Jennie feared, as Veronica hinted,
that she and William would go to live with Martha, who was installed
in a boarding-house in Cleveland, and that Gerhardt would be left
alone.He was such a pathetic figure to her, with his injured hands
and his one ability--that of being a watchman--that she was
hurt to think of his being left alone.She knew
that he would not--feeling as he did at present.Would Lester
have him--she was not sure of that.If he came Vesta would have
to be accounted for.The situation in regard to Vesta was really complicated.Owing to
the feeling that she was doing her daughter a great injustice, Jennie
was particularly sensitive in regard to her, anxious to do a thousand
things to make up for the one great duty that she could not perform.She daily paid a visit to the home of Mrs.Olsen, always taking with
her toys, candy, or whatever came into her mind as being likely to
interest and please the child.She liked to sit with Vesta and tell
her stories of fairy and giant, which kept the little girl wide-eyed.At last she went so far as to bring her to the apartment, when Lester
was away visiting his parents, and she soon found it possible, during
his several absences, to do this regularly.After that, as time went
on and she began to know his habits, she became more
bold--although bold is scarcely the word to use in connection
with Jennie.She became venturesome much as a mouse might; she would
risk Vesta's presence on the assurance of even short
absences--two or three days.She even got into the habit of
keeping a few of Vesta's toys at the apartment, so that she could have
something to play with when she came.During these several visits from her child Jennie could not but
realize the lovely thing life would be were she only an honored wife
and a happy mother.Vesta was a most observant little girl.She could
by her innocent childish questions give a hundred turns to the dagger
of self-reproach which was already planted deeply in Jennie's
heart.was one of her simplest and most
frequently repeated questions.Jennie would reply that mamma could not
have her just yet, but that very soon now, just as soon as she
possibly could, Vesta should come to stay always."No, dearest, not just when.You won't mind waiting
a little while."Yes," replied Vesta; "but then she ain't got any nice things now.And Jennie, stricken to the heart, would
take Vesta to the toy shop, and load her down with a new assortment of
playthings.Of course Lester was not in the least suspicious.His observation
of things relating to the home were rather casual.He went about his
work and his pleasures believing Jennie to be the soul of sincerity
and good-natured service, and it never occurred to him that there was
anything underhanded in her actions.Once he did come home sick in the
afternoon and found her absent--an absence which endured from two
o'clock to five.He was a little irritated and grumbled on her return,
but his annoyance was as nothing to her astonishment and fright when
she found him there.She blanched at the thought of his suspecting
something, and explained as best she could.She had gone to see her
washerwoman.She was sorry, too, that her absence had lost her an
opportunity to serve him.It showed her what a mess she was likely to
make of it all.It happened that about three weeks after the above occurrence
Lester had occasion to return to Cincinnati for a week, and during
this time Jennie again brought Vesta to the flat; for four days there
was the happiest goings on between the mother and child.Nothing would have come of this little reunion had it not been for
an oversight on Jennie's part, the far-reaching effects of which she
could only afterward regret.This was the leaving of a little toy lamb
under the large leather divan in the front room, where Lester was wont
to lie and smoke.A little bell held by a thread of blue ribbon was
fastened about its neck, and this tinkled feebly whenever it was
shaken.Vesta, with the unaccountable freakishness of children had
deliberately dropped it behind the divan, an action which Jennie did
not notice at the time.When she gathered up the various playthings
after Vesta's departure she overlooked it entirely, and there it
rested, its innocent eyes still staring upon the sunlit regions of
toyland, when Lester returned.That same evening, when he was lying on the divan, quietly enjoying
his cigar and his newspaper, he chanced to drop the former, fully
lighted.Wishing to recover it before it should do any damage, he
leaned over and looked under the divan.The cigar was not in sight, so
he rose and pulled the lounge out, a move which revealed to him the
little lamb still standing where Vesta had dropped it.He picked it
up, turning it over and over, and wondering how it had come there.It must belong to some neighbor's child in whom Jennie had
taken an interest, he thought.He would have to go and tease her about
this.Accordingly he held the toy jovially before him, and, coming out
into the dining-room, where Jennie was working at the sideboard, he
exclaimed in a mock solemn voice, "Where did this come from?"Jennie, who was totally unconscious of the existence of this
evidence of her duplicity, turned, and was instantly possessed with
the idea that he had suspected all and was about to visit his just
wrath upon her.Instantly the blood flamed in her cheeks and as
quickly left them.she stuttered, "it's a little toy I bought.""I see it is," he returned genially, her guilty tremor not escaping
his observation, but having at the same time no explicable
significance to him."It's frisking around a mighty lone
sheepfold."He touched the little bell at its throat, while Jennie stood there,
unable to speak.It tinkled feebly, and then he looked at her again.His manner was so humorous that she could tell he suspected nothing.However, it was almost impossible for her to recover her
self-possession."You look as though a lamb was a terrible shock to you.""I forgot to take it out from there, that was all," she went on
blindly."It looks as though it has been played with enough," he added more
seriously, and then seeing that the discussion was evidently painful
to her, he dropped it.The lamb had not furnished him the amusement
that he had expected.Lester went back into the front room, stretched himself out and
thought it over.What was there about a toy to
make her grow pale?Surely there was no harm in her harboring some
youngster of the neighborhood when she was alone--having it come
in and play.He thought it over, but
could come to no conclusion.Nothing more was said about the incident of the toy lamb.Time
might have wholly effaced the impression from Lester's memory had
nothing else intervened to arouse his suspicions; but a mishap of any
kind seems invariably to be linked with others which follow close upon
its heels.One evening when Lester happened to be lingering about the flat
later than usual the door bell rang, and, Jennie being busy in the
kitchen, Lester went himself to open the door.He was greeted by a
middle-aged lady, who frowned very nervously upon him, and inquired in
broken Swedish accents for Jennie."Wait a moment," said Lester; and stepping to the rear door he
called her.Jennie came, and seeing who the visitor was, she stepped nervously
out in the hall and closed the door after her.The action instantly
struck Lester as suspicious.He frowned and determined to inquire
thoroughly into the matter.Her face
was white and her fingers seemed to be nervously seeking something to
seize upon.he inquired, the irritation he had felt the
moment before giving his voice a touch of gruffness."I've got to go out for a little while," she at last managed to
reply."Very well," he assented unwillingly."But you can tell me what's
the trouble with you, can't you?"I--I," began Jennie, stammering."I--have--"

"Yes," he said grimly."I have to go on an errand," she stumbled on.I'll tell you when I come back, Lester.She looked vainly at him, her troubled countenance still marked by
preoccupation and anxiety to get away, and Lester, who had never seen
this look of intense responsibility in her before, was moved and
irritated by it."That's all right," he said, "but what's the use of all this
secrecy?Why can't you come out and tell what's the matter with you?What's the use of this whispering behind doors?He paused, checked by his own harshness, and Jennie, who was
intensely wrought up by the information she had received, as well as
the unwonted verbal castigation she was now enduring, rose to an
emotional state never reached by her before."I will, Lester, I will," she exclaimed.I'll tell you everything when I come back.She hurried to the adjoining chamber to get her wraps, and Lester,
who had even yet no clear conception of what it all meant, followed
her stubbornly to the door."See here," he exclaimed in his vigorous, brutal way, "you're not
acting right.He stood in the doorway, his whole frame exhibiting the pugnacity
and settled determination of a man who is bound to be obeyed.Jennie,
troubled and driven to bay, turned at last."It's my child, Lester," she exclaimed.I'll tell you everything when I
come back.""What the hell are you talking
about?""I couldn't help it," she returned."I was afraid--I should
have told you long ago.I meant to only--only--Oh, let me go
now, and I'll tell you all when I come back!"He stared at her in amazement; then he stepped aside, unwilling to
force her any further for the present."Well, go ahead," he said
quietly."Don't you want some one to go along with you?"She hurried forth, white-faced, and he stood there, pondering.Could this be the woman he had thought he knew?Why, she had been
deceiving him for years.He choked a little as he muttered:

"Well, I'll be damned!"CHAPTER XXIX


The reason why Jennie had been called was nothing more than one of
those infantile seizures the coming and result of which no man can
predict two hours beforehand.Vesta had been seriously taken with
membranous croup only a few hours before, and the development since
had been so rapid that the poor old Swedish mother was half frightened
to death herself, and hastily despatched a neighbor to say that Vesta
was very ill and Mrs.This message,
delivered as it was in a very nervous manner by one whose only object
was to bring her, had induced the soul-racking fear of death in Jennie
and caused her to brave the discovery of Lester in the manner
described.Jennie hurried on anxiously, her one thought being to reach
her child before the arm of death could interfere and snatch it from
her, her mind weighed upon by a legion of fears.What if it should
already be too late when she got there; what if Vesta already should
be no more.Instinctively she quickened her pace and as the street
lamps came and receded in the gloom she forgot all the sting of
Lester's words, all fear that he might turn her out and leave her
alone in a great city with a little child to care for, and remembered
only the fact that her Vesta was very ill, possibly dying, and that
she was the direct cause of the child's absence from her; that perhaps
but for the want of her care and attention Vesta might be well
to-night."If I can only get there," she kept saying to herself; and then,
with that frantic unreason which is the chief characteristic of the
instinct-driven mother: "I might have known that God would punish me
for my unnatural conduct.I might have known--I might have
known."When she reached the gate she fairly sped up the little walk and
into the house, where Vesta was lying pale, quiet, and weak, but
considerably better.Several Swedish neighbors and a middle-aged
physician were in attendance, all of whom looked at her curiously as
she dropped beside the child's bed and spoke to her.She had sinned, and sinned
grievously, against her daughter, but now she would make amends so far
as possible.Lester was very dear to her, but she would no longer
attempt to deceive him in anything, even if he left her--she felt
an agonized stab, a pain at the thought--she must still do the
one right thing.Vesta must not be an outcast any longer.Where Jennie was, there must Vesta be.Sitting by the bedside in this humble Swedish cottage, Jennie
realized the fruitlessness of her deception, the trouble and pain it
had created in her home, the months of suffering it had given her with
Lester, the agony it had heaped upon her this night--and to what
end?She sat there and
meditated, not knowing what next was to happen, while Vesta quieted
down, and then went soundly to sleep.Lester, after recovering from the first heavy import of this
discovery, asked himself some perfectly natural questions."Who was
the father of the child?How did it chance to be in
Chicago, and who was taking care of it?"He could ask, but he could
not answer; he knew absolutely nothing.Curiously, now, as he thought, his first meeting with Jennie at
Mrs.What was it about her then that
had attracted him?What made him think, after a few hours'
observation, that he could seduce her to do his will?What was
it--moral looseness, or weakness, or what?There must have been
art in the sorry affair, the practised art of the cheat, and, in
deceiving such a confiding nature as his, she had done even more than
practise deception--she had been ungrateful.Now the quality of ingratitude was a very objectionable thing to
Lester--the last and most offensive trait of a debased nature,
and to be able to discover a trace of it in Jennie was very
disturbing.It is true that she had not exhibited it in any other way
before--quite to the contrary--but nevertheless he saw
strong evidences of it now, and it made him very bitter in his feeling
toward her.How could she be guilty of any such conduct toward him?Had he not picked her up out of nothing, so to speak, and befriended
her?He moved from his chair in this silent room and began to pace
slowly to and fro, the weightiness of this subject exercising to the
full his power of decision.She was guilty of a misdeed which he felt
able to condemn.The original concealment was evil; the continued
deception more.Lastly, there was the thought that her love after all
had been divided, part for him, part for the child, a discovery which
no man in his position could contemplate with serenity.He moved
irritably as he thought of it, shoved his hands in his pockets and
walked to and fro across the floor.That a man of Lester's temperament should consider himself wronged
by Jennie merely because she had concealed a child whose existence was
due to conduct no more irregular than was involved later in the
yielding of herself to him was an example of those inexplicable
perversions of judgment to which the human mind, in its capacity of
keeper of the honor of others, seems permanently committed.Lester,
aside from his own personal conduct (for men seldom judge with that in
the balance), had faith in the ideal that a woman should reveal
herself completely to the one man with whom she is in love; and the
fact that she had not done so was a grief to him.He had asked her
once tentatively about her past.That
was the time she should have spoken of any child.His first impulse, after he had thought the thing over, was to walk
out and leave her.At the same time he was curious to hear the end of
this business.He did put on his hat and coat, however, and went out,
stopping at the first convenient saloon to get a drink.He took a car
and went down to the club, strolling about the different rooms and
chatting with several people whom he encountered.He was restless and
irritated; and finally, after three hours of meditation, he took a cab
and returned to his apartment.The distraught Jennie, sitting by her sleeping child, was at last
made to realize, by its peaceful breathing that all danger was over.There was nothing more that she could do for Vesta, and now the claims
of the home that she had deserted began to reassert themselves, the
promise to Lester and the need of being loyal to her duties unto the
very end.It was just
probable that he wished to hear the remainder of her story before
breaking with her entirely.Although anguished and frightened by the
certainty, as she deemed it, of his forsaking her, she nevertheless
felt that it was no more than she deserved--a just punishment for
all her misdoings.When Jennie arrived at the flat it was after eleven, and the hall
light was already out.She first tried the door, and then inserted her
key.No one stirred, however, and, opening the door, she entered in
the expectation of seeing Lester sternly confronting her.The burning gas had merely been an oversight on his
part.She glanced quickly about, but seeing only the empty room, she
came instantly to the other conclusion, that he had forsaken
her--and so stood there, a meditative, helpless figure.At this moment his footsteps sounded on the stairs.He came in with
his derby hat pulled low over his broad forehead, close to his sandy
eyebrows, and with his overcoat buttoned up closely about his neck.He
took off the coat without looking at Jennie and hung it on the rack.Then he deliberately took off his hat and hung that up also.When he
was through he turned to where she was watching him with wide
eyes."I want to know about this thing now from beginning to end," he
began.Jennie wavered a moment, as one who might be going to take a leap
in the dark, then opened her lips mechanically and confessed:

"It's Senator Brander's."echoed Lester, the familiar name of the dead but
still famous statesman ringing with shocking and unexpected force in
his ears."We used to do his washing for him," she rejoined simply--"my
mother and I."Lester paused, the baldness of the statements issuing from her
sobering even his rancorous mood."Senator Brander's child," he
thought to himself.So that great representative of the interests of
the common people was the undoer of her--a self-confessed
washerwoman's daughter.A fine tragedy of low life all this was.he demanded, his face the picture of a
darkling mood."It's been nearly six years now," she returned.He calculated the time that had elapsed since he had known her, and
then continued:

"How old is the child?"The need for serious thought made his tone
more peremptory but less bitter."Where have you been keeping her all this time?""She was at home until you went to Cincinnati last spring."Was she there the times I came to Cleveland?""Yes," said Jennie; "but I didn't let her come out anywhere where
you could see her.""I thought you said you told your people that you were married," he
exclaimed, wondering how this relationship of the child to the family
could have been adjusted."I did," she replied, "but I didn't want to tell you about her."I didn't know what was going to become of me when I went with you,
Lester.I didn't want to do her any harm if I could help it.I was
ashamed, afterward; when you said you didn't like children I was
afraid."He stopped, the simplicity of her answers removing a part of the
suspicion of artful duplicity which had originally weighed upon him.After all, there was not so much of that in it as mere wretchedness of
circumstance and cowardice of morals.What queer non-moral natures they must have to have brooked any such a
combination of affairs!"Didn't you know that you'd be found out in the long run?""Surely you might have seen that you couldn't raise her
that way.Why didn't you tell me in the first place?I wouldn't have
thought anything of it then."She stood there, the contradictory aspect of these questions and of
his attitude puzzling even herself.She did try to explain them after
a time, but all Lester could gain was that she had blundered along
without any artifice at all--a condition that was so manifest
that, had he been in any other position than that he was, he might
have pitied her.As it was, the revelation concerning Brander was
hanging over him, and he finally returned to that."You say your mother used to do washing for him.How did you come
to get in with him?"Jennie, who until now had borne his questions with unmoving pain,
winced at this.He was now encroaching upon the period that was by far
the most distressing memory of her life.What he had just asked seemed
to be a demand upon her to make everything clear."I was so young, Lester," she pleaded.I used to go to the hotel where he was stopping and get
his laundry, and at the end of the week I'd take it to him again."She paused, and as he took a chair, looking as if he expected to
hear the whole story, she continued: "We were so poor.He used to give
me money to give to my mother.She paused again, totally unable to go on, and he, seeing that it
would be impossible for her to explain without prompting, took up his
questioning again--eliciting by degrees the whole pitiful story.He had written to her, but before
he could come to her he died.It was followed by a period of five
minutes, in which Lester said nothing at all; he put his arm on the
mantel and stared at the wall, while Jennie waited, not knowing what
would follow--not wishing to make a single plea.Lester's face betrayed no sign of either thought or feeling.He was now quite calm, quite sober, wondering what he should do.Jennie was before him as the criminal at the bar.He, the righteous,
the moral, the pure of heart, was in the judgment seat.Now to
sentence her--to make up his mind what course of action he should
pursue.It was a disagreeable tangle, to be sure, something that a man of
his position and wealth really ought not to have anything to do with.This child, the actuality of it, put an almost unbearable face upon
the whole matter--and yet he was not quite prepared to speak.He
turned after a time, the silvery tinkle of the French clock on the
mantel striking three and causing him to become aware of Jennie, pale,
uncertain, still standing as she had stood all this while."Better go to bed," he said at last, and fell again to pondering
this difficult problem.But Jennie continued to stand there wide-eyed, expectant, ready to
hear at any moment his decision as to her fate.After a long time of musing he turned and went to the
clothes-rack near the door."Better go to bed," he said, indifferently.She turned instinctively, feeling that even in this crisis there
was some little service that she might render, but he did not see her.He went out, vouchsafing no further speech.She looked after him, and as his footsteps sounded on the stair she
felt as if she were doomed and hearing her own death-knell.She stood there a dissonance of
despair, and when the lower door clicked moved her hand out of the
agony of her suppressed hopelessness.In the light of a late dawn she was still sitting there pondering,
her state far too urgent for idle tears.CHAPTER XXX


The sullen, philosophic Lester was not so determined upon his
future course of action as he appeared to be.Stern as was his mood,
he did not see, after all, exactly what grounds he had for complaint.And yet the child's existence complicated matters considerably.He did
not like to see the evidence of Jennie's previous misdeeds walking
about in the shape of a human being; but, as a matter of fact, he
admitted to himself that long ago he might have forced Jennie's story
out of her if he had gone about it in earnest.She would not have
lied, he knew that.At the very outset he might have demanded the
history of her past.He had not done so; well, now it was too late.The one thing it did fix in his mind was that it would be useless to
ever think of marrying her.It couldn't be done, not by a man in his
position.The best solution of the problem was to make reasonable
provision for Jennie and then leave her.He went to his hotel with his
mind made up, but he did not actually say to himself that he would do
it at once.It is an easy thing for a man to theorize in a situation of this
kind, quite another to act.Our comforts, appetites and passions grow
with usage, and Jennie was not only a comfort, but an appetite, with
him.Almost four years of constant association had taught him so much
about her and himself that he was not prepared to let go easily or
quickly.He could think of it bustling
about the work of a great organization during the daytime, but when
night came it was a different matter.He could be lonely, too, he
discovered much to his surprise, and it disturbed him.One of the things that interested him in this situation was
Jennie's early theory that the intermingling of Vesta with him and her
in this new relationship would injure the child.Just how did she come
by that feeling, he wanted to know?His place in the world was better
than hers, yet it dawned on him after a time that there might have
been something in her point of view.She did not know who he was or
what he would do with her.Being
uncertain, she wished to protect her baby.Then
again, he was curious to know what the child was like.The daughter of
a man like Senator Brander might be somewhat of an infant.He was a
brilliant man and Jennie was a charming woman.He thought of this,
and, while it irritated him, it aroused his curiosity.He ought to go
back and see the child--he was really entitled to a view of
it--but he hesitated because of his own attitude in the
beginning.It seemed to him that he really ought to quit, and here he
was parleying with himself.These years of living with Jennie
had made him curiously dependent upon her.Who had ever been so close
to him before?His mother loved him, but her attitude toward him had
not so much to do with real love as with ambition.His
father--well, his father was a man, like himself.All of his
sisters were distinctly wrapped up in their own affairs; Robert and he
were temperamentally uncongenial.With Jennie he had really been
happy, he had truly lived.She was necessary to him; the longer he
stayed away from her the more he wanted her.He finally decided to
have a straight-out talk with her, to arrive at some sort of
understanding.She ought to get the child and take care of it.She
must understand that he might eventually want to quit.She ought to be
made to feel that a definite change had taken place, though no
immediate break might occur.That same evening he went out to the
apartment.Jennie heard him enter, and her heart began to flutter.Then she took her courage in both hands, and went to meet him."There's just one thing to be done about this as far as I can see,"
began Lester, with characteristic directness."Get the child and bring her here where you can take care of her.There's no use leaving her in the hands of strangers.""I will, Lester," said Jennie submissively."Very well, then, you'd better do it at once."He took an evening
newspaper out of his pocket and strolled toward one of the front
windows; then he turned to her."You and I might as well understand
each other, Jennie," he went on."I can see how this thing came about.It was a piece of foolishness on my part not to have asked you before,
and made you tell me.It was silly for you to conceal it, even if you
didn't want the child's life mixed with mine.You might have known
that it couldn't be done.That's neither here nor there, though, now.The thing that I want to point out is that one can't live and hold a
relationship such as ours without confidence.You and I had that, I
thought.I don't see my way clear to ever hold more than a tentative
relationship with you on this basis."Now, I don't propose to do anything hasty.For my part I don't see
why things can't go on about as they are--certainly for the
present--but I want you to look the facts in the face.""I know, Lester," she said, "I know."There were some trees in the
yard, where the darkness was settling.He wondered how this would
really come out, for he liked a home atmosphere.Should he leave the
apartment and go to his club?"You'd better get the dinner," he suggested, after a time, turning
toward her irritably; but he did not feel so distant as he looked.It
was a shame that life could not be more decently organized.He
strolled back to his lounge, and Jennie went about her duties.She was
thinking of Vesta, of her ungrateful attitude toward Lester, of his
final decision never to marry her.So that was how one dream had been
wrecked by folly.She spread the table, lighted the pretty silver candles, made his
favorite biscuit, put a small leg of lamb in the oven to roast, and
washed some lettuce-leaves for a salad.She had been a diligent
student of a cook-book for some time, and she had learned a good deal
from her mother.All the time she was wondering how the situation
would work out.He would leave her eventually--no doubt of that.He would go away and marry some one else."Oh, well," she thought finally, "he is not going to leave me right
away--that is something.She sighed
as she carried the things to the table.If life would only give her
Lester and Vesta together--but that hope was over.CHAPTER XXXI


There was peace and quiet for some time after this storm.Jennie
went the next day and brought Vesta away with her.The joy of the
reunion between mother and child made up for many other worries."Now
I can do by her as I ought," she thought; and three or four times
during the day she found herself humming a little song.He was trying to make
himself believe that he ought to do something toward reforming his
life--toward bringing about that eventual separation which he had
suggested.He did not like the idea of a child being in this
apartment--particularly that particular child.He fought his way
through a period of calculated neglect, and then began to return to
the apartment more regularly.In spite of all its drawbacks, it was a
place of quiet, peace, and very notable personal comfort.During the first days of Lester's return it was difficult for
Jennie to adjust matters so as to keep the playful, nervous, almost
uncontrollable child from annoying the staid, emphatic,
commercial-minded man.Jennie gave Vesta a severe talking to the first
night Lester telephoned that he was coming, telling her that he was a
very bad-tempered man who didn't like children, and that she mustn't
go near him."You mustn't talk," she said.Let mamma ask you what you want.Vesta agreed solemnly, but her childish mind hardly grasped the
full significance of the warning.Jennie, who had taken great pains to array
Vesta as attractively as possible, had gone into her bedroom to give
her own toilet a last touch.As a
matter of fact, she had followed her mother to the door of the
sitting-room, where now she could be plainly seen.Lester hung up his
hat and coat, then, turning, he caught his first glimpse.The child
looked very sweet--he admitted that at a glance.She was arrayed
in a blue-dotted, white flannel dress, with a soft roll collar and
cuffs, and the costume was completed by white stockings and shoes.Her
corn-colored ringlets hung gaily about her face.Blue eyes, rosy lips,
rosy cheeks completed the picture.Lester stared, almost inclined to
say something, but restrained himself.When Jennie came out he commented on the fact that Vesta had
arrived."Rather sweet-looking child," he said."Do you have much
trouble in making her mind?"Jennie went on to the dining-room, and Lester overheard a scrap of
their conversation.Didn't I tell you you mustn't
talk?"What might have followed if the child had been homely, misshapen,
peevish, or all three, can scarcely be conjectured.Had Jennie been
less tactful, even in the beginning, he might have obtained a
disagreeable impression.As it was, the natural beauty of the child,
combined with the mother's gentle diplomacy in keeping her in the
background, served to give him that fleeting glimpse of innocence and
youth which is always pleasant.The thought struck him that Jennie had
been the mother of a child all these years; she had been separated
from it for months at a time; she had never even hinted at its
existence, and yet her affection for Vesta was obviously great."It's
queer," he said.One morning Lester was sitting in the parlor reading his paper when
he thought he heard something stir.He turned, and was surprised to
see a large blue eye fixed upon him through the crack of a neighboring
door--the effect was most disconcerting.It was not like the
ordinary eye, which, under such embarrassing circumstances, would have
been immediately withdrawn; it kept its position with deliberate
boldness.He turned his paper solemnly and looked again.He crossed his
legs and looked again.This little episode, unimportant in itself, was yet informed with
the saving grace of comedy, a thing to which Lester was especially
responsive.Although not in the least inclined to relax his attitude
of aloofness, he found his mind, in the minutest degree, tickled by
the mysterious appearance; the corners of his mouth were animated by a
desire to turn up.He did not give way to the feeling, and stuck by
his paper, but the incident remained very clearly in his mind.The
young wayfarer had made her first really important impression upon
him.Not long after this Lester was sitting one morning at breakfast,
calmly eating his chop and conning his newspaper, when he was aroused
by another visitation--this time not quite so simple.Jennie had
given Vesta her breakfast, and set her to amuse herself alone until
Lester should leave the house.Jennie was seated at the table, pouring
out the coffee, when Vesta suddenly appeared, very business-like in
manner, and marched through the room.Lester looked up, and Jennie
colored and arose.By this time, however, Vesta had reached the kitchen, secured a
little broom, and returned, a droll determination lighting her
face."I want my little broom," she exclaimed and marched sedately past,
at which manifestation of spirit Lester again twitched internally,
this time allowing the slightest suggestion of a smile to play across
his mouth.The final effect of this intercourse was gradually to break down
the feeling of distaste Lester had for the child, and to establish in
its place a sort of tolerant recognition of her possibilities as a
human being.The developments of the next six months were of a kind to further
relax the strain of opposition which still existed in Lester's mind.Although not at all resigned to the somewhat tainted atmosphere in
which he was living, he yet found himself so comfortable that he could
not persuade himself to give it up.It was too much like a bed of
down.The condition of unquestioned
liberty, so far as all his old social relationships were concerned,
coupled with the privilege of quiet, simplicity, and affection in the
home was too inviting.He lingered on, and began to feel that perhaps
it would be just as well to let matters rest as they were.During this period his friendly relations with the little Vesta
insensibly strengthened.He discovered that there was a real flavor of
humor about Vesta's doings, and so came to watch for its development.She was forever doing something interesting, and although Jennie
watched over her with a care that was in itself a revelation to him,
nevertheless Vesta managed to elude every effort to suppress her and
came straight home with her remarks.Once, for example, she was sawing
away at a small piece of meat upon her large plate with her big knife,
when Lester remarked to Jennie that it might be advisable to get her a
little breakfast set.Jennie, who never could tell what was to follow,
reached over and put it down, while Lester with difficulty restrained
a desire to laugh.Another morning, not long after, she was watching Jennie put the
lumps of sugar in Lester's cup, when she broke in with, "I want two
lumps in mine, mamma.""No, dearest," replied Jennie, "you don't need any in yours."Uncle Lester has two," she protested."Yes," returned Jennie; "but you're only a little girl.Besides you
mustn't say anything like that at the table."Uncle Lester eats too much sugar," was her immediate rejoinder, at
which that fine gourmet smiled broadly."I don't know about that," he put in, for the first time deigning
to answer her directly."That sounds like the fox and grapes to me."Vesta smiled back at him, and now that the ice was broken she
chattered on unrestrainedly.One thing led to another, and at last
Lester felt as though, in a way, the little girl belonged to him; he
was willing even that she should share in such opportunities as his
position and wealth might make possible--provided, of course,
that he stayed with Jennie, and that they worked out some arrangement
which would not put him hopelessly out of touch with the world which
was back of him, and which he had to keep constantly in mind.CHAPTER XXXII


The following spring the show-rooms and warehouse were completed,
and Lester removed his office to the new building.Heretofore, he had
been transacting all his business affairs at the Grand Pacific and the
club.From now on he felt himself to be firmly established in
Chicago--as if that was to be his future home.A large number of
details were thrown upon him--the control of a considerable
office force, and the handling of various important transactions.It
took away from him the need of traveling, that duty going to Amy's
husband, under the direction of Robert.The latter was doing his best
to push his personal interests, not only through the influence he was
bringing to bear upon his sisters, but through his reorganization of
the factory.Several men whom Lester was personally fond of were in
danger of elimination.But Lester did not hear of this, and Kane
senior was inclined to give Robert a free hand.He was glad to see some one with a strong policy come up and take
charge.Apparently he and Robert were on
better terms than ever before.Matters might have gone on smoothly enough were it not for the fact
that Lester's private life with Jennie was not a matter which could be
permanently kept under cover.At times he was seen driving with her by
people who knew him in a social and commercial way.He was for
brazening it out on the ground that he was a single man, and at
liberty to associate with anybody he pleased.Jennie might be any
young woman of good family in whom he was interested.He did not
propose to introduce her to anybody if he could help it, and he always
made it a point to be a fast traveler in driving, in order that others
might not attempt to detain and talk to him.At the theater, as has
been said, she was simply "Miss Gerhardt."The trouble was that many of his friends were also keen observers
of life.They had no quarrel to pick with Lester's conduct.Only he
had been seen in other cities, in times past, with this same woman.She must be some one whom he was maintaining irregularly.Wealth and youthful spirits must have their fling.Rumors came
to Robert, who, however, kept his own counsel.If Lester wanted to do
this sort of thing, well and good.But there must come a time when
there would be a show-down.This came about in one form about a year and a half after Lester
and Jennie had been living in the north side apartment.It so happened
that, during a stretch of inclement weather in the fall, Lester was
seized with a mild form of grip.When he felt the first symptoms he
thought that his indisposition would be a matter of short duration,
and tried to overcome it by taking a hot bath and a liberal dose of
quinine.But the infection was stronger than he counted on; by morning
he was flat on his back, with a severe fever and a splitting
headache.His long period of association with Jennie had made him incautious.Policy would have dictated that he should betake himself to his hotel
and endure his sickness alone.As a matter of fact, he was very glad
to be in the house with her.He had to call up the office to say that
he was indisposed and would not be down for a day or so; then he
yielded himself comfortably to her patient ministrations.Jennie, of course, was delighted to have Lester with her, sick or
well.She persuaded him to see a doctor and have him prescribe.She
brought him potions of hot lemonade, and bathed his face and hands in
cold water over and over.Later, when he was recovering, she made him
appetizing cups of beef-tea or gruel.It was during this illness that the first real contretemps
occurred.Lester's sister Louise, who had been visiting friends in St.Paul, and who had written him that she might stop off to see him on
her way, decided upon an earlier return than she had originally
planned.While Lester was sick at his apartment she arrived in
Chicago.Calling up the office, and finding that he was not there and
would not be down for several days, she asked where he could be
reached."I think he is at his rooms in the Grand Pacific," said an
incautious secretary.Louise, a little
disturbed, telephoned to the Grand Pacific, and was told that Mr.Kane
had not been there for several days--did not, as a matter of
fact, occupy his rooms more than one or two days a week.Piqued by
this, she telephoned his club.It so happened that at the club there was a telephone boy who had
called up the apartment a number of times for Lester himself.He had
not been cautioned not to give its number--as a matter of fact,
it had never been asked for by any one else.When Louise stated that
she was Lester's sister, and was anxious to find him, the boy replied,
"I think he lives at 19 Schiller Place.""Whose address is that you're giving?""Well, don't be giving out addresses.The boy apologized, but Louise had hung up the receiver and was
gone.About an hour later, curious as to this third residence of her
brother, Louise arrived at Schiller Place.Ascending the
steps--it was a two-apartment house--she saw the name of
Kane on the door leading to the second floor.Ringing the bell, she
was opened to by Jennie, who was surprised to see so fashionably
attired a young woman.Kane's apartment, I believe," began Louise,
condescendingly, as she looked in at the open door behind Jennie.She
was a little surprised to meet a young woman, but her suspicions were
as yet only vaguely aroused.Jennie, had she had time to collect her thoughts, would have tried
to make some excuse, but Louise, with the audacity of her birth and
station, swept past before Jennie could say a word.Once inside Louise
looked about her inquiringly.She found herself in the sitting-room,
which gave into the bedroom where Lester was lying.Vesta happened to
be playing in one corner of the room, and stood up to eye the
new-comer.The open bedroom showed Lester quite plainly lying in bed,
a window to the left of him, his eyes closed."Oh, there you are, old fellow!"Lester, who at the sound of her voice had opened his eyes, realized
in an instant how things were.He pulled himself up on one elbow, but
words failed him."Why, hello, Louise," he finally forced himself to say.I came back sooner than I thought," she answered lamely,
a sense of something wrong irritating her."I had a hard time finding
you, too.Who's your--" she was about to say "pretty
housekeeper," but turned to find Jennie dazedly gathering up certain
articles in the adjoining room and looking dreadfully distraught.His sister swept the place with an observing eye.It took in the
home atmosphere, which was both pleasing and suggestive.There was a
dress of Jennie's lying across a chair, in a familiar way, which
caused Miss Kane to draw herself up warily.She looked at her brother,
who had a rather curious expression in his eyes--he seemed
slightly nonplussed, but cool and defiant."You shouldn't have come out here," said Lester finally, before
Louise could give vent to the rising question in her mind."You're my brother, aren't you?Why should you have any place that I
couldn't come.Well, I like that--and from you to me.""Listen, Louise," went on Lester, drawing himself up further on one
elbow."You know as much about life as I do.There is no need of our
getting into an argument.I didn't know you were coming, or I would
have made other arrangements.""Other arrangements, indeed," she sneered.She was greatly irritated to think that she had fallen into this
trap; it was really disgraceful of Lester."I wouldn't be so haughty about it," he declared, his color rising."I'm not apologizing to you for my conduct.I'm saying I would have
made other arrangements, which is a very different thing from begging
your pardon.If you don't want to be civil, you needn't.""I thought
better of you, honestly I did.I should think you would be ashamed of
yourself living here in open--" she paused without using the
word--"and our friends scattered all over the city.I thought you had more sense of decency and
consideration.""I tell you I'm not apologizing to
you.If you don't like this you know what you can do."she demanded, savagely and yet
curiously.If it were it wouldn't make any
difference.I wish you wouldn't busy yourself about my affairs."Jennie, who had been moving about the dining-room beyond the
sitting-room, heard the cutting references to herself.I won't any more," retorted Louise."I
should think, though, that you, of all men, would be above anything
like this--and that with a woman so obviously beneath you.Why, I
thought she was--" she was again going to add "your housekeeper,"
but she was interrupted by Lester, who was angry to the point of
brutality."Never mind what you thought she was," he growled."She's better
than some who do the so-called superior thinking.It's neither here nor there, I tell you.I'm doing this, and I
don't care what you think."Well, I won't, I assure you," she flung back."It's quite plain
that your family means nothing to you.But if you had any sense of
decency, Lester Kane, you would never let your sister be trapped into
coming into a place like this.I'm disgusted, that's all, and so will
the others be when they hear of it."She turned on her heel and walked scornfully out, a withering look
being reserved for Jennie, who had unfortunately stepped near the door
of the dining-room.Jennie came in a little
while later and closed the door.Lester,
his thick hair pushed back from his vigorous face, leaned back moodily
on his pillow."What a devilish trick of fortune," he thought.Now she
would go home and tell it to the family.His father would know, and
his mother.Robert, Imogene, Amy all would hear.He would have no
explanation to make--she had seen.Meanwhile Jennie, moving about her duties, also found food for
reflection.So this was her real position in another woman's eyes.Now
she could see what the world thought.This family was as aloof from
her as if it lived on another planet.To his sisters and brothers, his
father and mother, she was a bad woman, a creature far beneath him
socially, far beneath him mentally and morally, a creature of the
streets.And she had hoped somehow to rehabilitate herself in the eyes
of the world.It cut her as nothing before had ever done.The thought
tore a great, gaping wound in her sensibilities.She was really low
and vile in her--Louise's--eyes, in the world's eyes,
basically so in Lester's eyes.She went
about numb and still, but the ache of defeat and disgrace was under it
all.Oh, if she could only see some way to make herself right with the
world, to live honorably, to be decent.How could that possibly be
brought about?CHAPTER XXXIII


Outraged in her family pride, Louise lost no time in returning to
Cincinnati, where she told the story of her discovery, embellished
with many details.According to her, she was met at the door by a
"silly-looking, white-faced woman," who did not even offer to invite
her in when she announced her name, but stood there "looking just as
guilty as a person possibly could."Lester also had acted shamefully,
having outbrazened the matter to her face.When she had demanded to
know whose the child was he had refused to tell her."It isn't mine,"
was all he would say.Kane, who was the first to hear
the story.exclaimed Louise emphatically, as though the
words needed to be reiterated to give them any shadow of reality."I went there solely because I thought I could help him," continued
Louise."I thought when they said he was indisposed that he might be
seriously ill."To think he would come to
anything like that!"Kane turned the difficult problem over in her mind and, having
no previous experiences whereby to measure it, telephoned for old
Archibald, who came out from the factory and sat through the
discussion with a solemn countenance.So Lester was living openly with
a woman of whom they had never heard.He would probably be as defiant
and indifferent as his nature was strong.The standpoint of parental
authority was impossible.Lester was a centralized authority in
himself, and if any overtures for a change of conduct were to be made,
they would have to be very diplomatically executed.Archibald Kane returned to the manufactory sore and disgusted, but
determined that something ought to be done.He held a consultation
with Robert, who confessed that he had heard disturbing rumors from
time to time, but had not wanted to say anything.Kane suggested
that Robert might go to Chicago and have a talk with Lester."He ought to see that this thing, if continued, is going to do him
irreparable damage," said Mr."He cannot hope to carry it off
successfully.He ought to marry her or he ought to quit.I
want you to tell him that for me.""All well and good," said Robert, "but who's going to convince him?I'm sure I don't want the job.""I hope to," said old Archibald, "eventually; but you'd better go
up and try, anyhow."I don't believe it," replied Robert.You see
how much good talk does down here.Still, I'll go if it will relieve
your feelings any."Yes, yes," said his father distractedly, "better go."Without allowing himself to anticipate any
particular measure of success in this adventure, he rode pleasantly
into Chicago confident in the reflection that he had all the powers of
morality and justice on his side.Upon Robert's arrival, the third morning after Louise's interview,
he called up the warerooms, but Lester was not there.He then
telephoned to the house, and tactfully made an appointment.Lester was
still indisposed, but he preferred to come down to the office, and he
did.He met Robert in his cheerful, nonchalant way, and together they
talked business for a time."Well, I suppose you know what brought me up here," began Robert
tentatively."I think I could make a guess at it," Lester replied."They were all very much worried over the fact that you were
sick--mother particularly.You're not in any danger of having a
relapse, are you?""Louise said there was some sort of a peculiar menage
she ran into up here."The young woman Louise saw is just--" Robert waved his hand
expressively."I don't want to be inquisitive, Lester.I'm simply here because the family felt that I ought to come.Mother
was so very much distressed that I couldn't do less than see you for
her sake"--he paused, and Lester, touched by the fairness and
respect of his attitude, felt that mere courtesy at least made some
explanation due."I don't know that anything I can say will help matters much," he
replied thoughtfully.I have the
woman and the family has its objections.The chief difficulty about
the thing seems to be the bad luck in being found out."He stopped, and Robert turned over the substance of this worldly
reasoning in his mind.He seemed, as
usual, to be most convincingly sane."You're not contemplating marrying her, are you?""I hadn't come to that," answered Lester coolly.They looked at each other quietly for a moment, and then Robert
turned his glance to the distant scene of the city."It's useless to ask whether you are seriously in love with her, I
suppose," ventured Robert."I don't know whether I'd be able to discuss that divine afflatus
with you or not," returned Lester, with a touch of grim humor."I have
never experienced the sensation myself.All I know is that the lady is
very pleasing to me.""Well, it's all a question of your own well-being and the family's,
Lester," went on Robert, after another pause."Morality doesn't seem
to figure in it anyway--at least you and I can't discuss that
together.Your feelings on that score naturally relate to you alone.But the matter of your own personal welfare seems to me to be
substantial enough ground to base a plea on.The family's feelings and
pride are also fairly important.Father's the kind of a man who sets
more store by the honor of his family than most men.You know that as
well as I do, of course.""I know how father feels about it," returned Lester."The whole
business is as clear to me as it is to any of you, though off-hand I
don't see just what's to be done about it.These matters aren't always
of a day's growth, and they can't be settled in a day.To a certain extent I'm responsible that she is here.While I'm
not willing to go into details, there's always more in these affairs
than appears on the court calendar.""Of course I don't know what your relations with her have been,"
returned Robert, "and I'm not curious to know, but it does look like a
bit of injustice all around, don't you think--unless you intend
to marry her?"This last was put forth as a feeler."I might be willing to agree to that, too," was Lester's baffling
reply, "if anything were to be gained by it.The point is, the woman
is here, and the family is in possession of the fact.Now if there is
anything to be done I have to do it.There isn't anybody else who can
act for me in this matter."Lester lapsed into a silence, and Robert rose and paced the floor,
coming back after a time to say: "You say you haven't any idea of
marrying her--or rather you haven't come to it.It seems to me you would be making the mistake of your life,
from every point of view.I don't want to orate, but a man of your
position has so much to lose; you can't afford to do it.Aside from
family considerations, you have too much at stake.You'd be simply
throwing your life away--"

He paused, with his right hand held out before him, as was
customary when he was deeply in earnest, and Lester felt the candor
and simplicity of this appeal.He
was making an appeal to him, and this was somewhat different.The appeal passed without comment, however, and then Robert began
on a new tack, this time picturing old Archibald's fondness for Lester
and the hope he had always entertained that he would marry some
well-to-do Cincinnati girl, Catholic, if agreeable to him, but at
least worthy of his station.Kane felt the same way; surely
Lester must realize that."I know just how all of them feel about it," Lester interrupted at
last, "but I don't see that anything's to be done right now.""You mean that you don't think it would be policy for you to give
her up just at present?""I mean that she's been exceptionally good to me, and that I'm
morally under obligations to do the best I can by her.What that may
be, I can't tell.""Certainly not to turn her out bag and baggage if she has been
accustomed to live with me," replied Lester.Robert sat down again, as if he considered his recent appeal
futile."Can't family reasons persuade you to make some amicable
arrangements with her and let her go?""Not without due consideration of the matter; no.""You don't think you could hold out some hope that the thing will
end quickly--something that would give me a reasonable excuse for
softening down the pain of it to the family?""I would be perfectly willing to do anything which would take away
the edge of this thing for the family, but the truth's the truth, and
I can't see any room for equivocation between you and me.As I've said
before, these relationships are involved with things which make it
impossible to discuss them--unfair to me, unfair to the woman.No
one can see how they are to be handled, except the people that are in
them, and even they can't always see.I'd be a damned dog to stand up
here and give you my word to do anything except the best I can."Lester stopped, and now Robert rose and paced the floor again, only
to come back after a time and say, "You don't think there's anything
to be done just at present?""Very well, then, I expect I might as well be going.I don't know
that there's anything else we can talk about.""Won't you stay and take lunch with me?I think I might manage to
get down to the hotel if you'll stay.""I believe I can make that one
o'clock train for Cincinnati.They stood before each other now, Lester pale and rather flaccid,
Robert clear, wax-like, well-knit, and shrewd, and one could see the
difference time had already made.Robert was the clean, decisive man,
Lester the man of doubts.Robert was the spirit of business energy and
integrity embodied, Lester the spirit of commercial self-sufficiency,
looking at life with an uncertain eye.Together they made a striking
picture, which was none the less powerful for the thoughts that were
now running through their minds."Well," said the older brother, after a time, "I don't suppose
there is anything more I can say.I had hoped to make you feel just as
we do about this thing, but of course you are your own best judge of
this.If you don't see it now, nothing I could say would make you.It
strikes me as a very bad move on your part though."He said nothing, but his face expressed an
unchanged purpose.Robert turned for his hat, and they walked to the office door
together."I'll put the best face I can on it," said Robert, and walked
out.CHAPTER XXXIV


In this world of ours the activities of animal life seem to be
limited to a plane or circle, as if that were an inherent necessity to
the creatures of a planet which is perforce compelled to swing about
the sun.A fish, for instance, may not pass out of the circle of the
seas without courting annihilation; a bird may not enter the domain of
the fishes without paying for it dearly.From the parasites of the
flowers to the monsters of the jungle and the deep we see clearly the
circumscribed nature of their movements--the emphatic manner in
which life has limited them to a sphere; and we are content to note
the ludicrous and invariably fatal results which attend any effort on
their part to depart from their environment.In the case of man, however, the operation of this theory of
limitations has not as yet been so clearly observed.The laws
governing our social life are not so clearly understood as to permit
of a clear generalization.Still, the opinions, pleas, and judgments
of society serve as boundaries which are none the less real for being
intangible.When men or women err--that is, pass out from the
sphere in which they are accustomed to move--it is not as if the
bird had intruded itself into the water, or the wild animal into the
haunts of man.People may do
no more than elevate their eyebrows in astonishment, laugh
sarcastically, lift up their hands in protest.And yet so well defined
is the sphere of social activity that he who departs from it is
doomed.Born and bred in this environment, the individual is
practically unfitted for any other state.He is like a bird accustomed
to a certain density of atmosphere, and which cannot live comfortably
at either higher or lower level.Lester sat down in his easy-chair by the window after his brother
had gone and gazed ruminatively out over the flourishing city.Yonder
was spread out before him life with its concomitant phases of energy,
hope, prosperity, and pleasure, and here he was suddenly struck by a
wind of misfortune and blown aside for the time being--his
prospects and purposes dissipated.Could he continue as cheerily in
the paths he had hitherto pursued?Would not his relations with Jennie
be necessarily affected by this sudden tide of opposition?Was not his
own home now a thing of the past so far as his old easy-going
relationship was concerned?All the atmosphere of unstained affection
would be gone out of it now.That hearty look of approval which used
to dwell in his father's eye--would it be there any longer?Robert, his relations with the manufactory, everything that was a part
of his old life, had been affected by this sudden intrusion of
Louise."It's unfortunate," was all that he thought to himself, and
therewith turned from what he considered senseless brooding to the
consideration of what, if anything, was to be done."I'm thinking I'd take a run up to Mt.Clemens to-morrow, or
Thursday anyhow, if I feel strong enough," he said to Jennie after he
had returned."I'm not feeling as well as I might.He wanted to get off by himself and think.Jennie packed his
bag for him at the given time, and he departed, but he was in a
sullen, meditative mood.During the week that followed he had ample time to think it all
over, the result of his cogitations being that there was no need of
making a decisive move at present.A few weeks more, one way or the
other, could not make any practical difference.Neither Robert nor any
other member of the family was at all likely to seek another
conference with him.His business relations would necessarily go on as
usual, since they were coupled with the welfare of the manufactory;
certainly no attempt to coerce him would be attempted.But the
consciousness that he was at hopeless variance with his family weighed
upon him."Bad business," he meditated--"bad business."For the period of a whole year this unsatisfactory state of affairs
continued.Lester did not go home for six months; then an important
business conference demanding his presence, he appeared and carried it
off quite as though nothing important had happened.His mother kissed
him affectionately, if a little sadly; his father gave him his
customary greeting, a hearty handshake; Robert, Louise, Amy, Imogene,
concertedly, though without any verbal understanding, agreed to ignore
the one real issue.But the feeling of estrangement was there, and it
persisted.Hereafter his visits to Cincinnati were as few and far
between as he could possibly make them.CHAPTER XXXV


In the meantime Jennie had been going through a moral crisis of her
own.For the first time in her life, aside from the family attitude,
which had afflicted her greatly, she realized what the world thought
of her.She had yielded on two
occasions to the force of circumstances which might have been fought
out differently.If she did not
always have this haunting sense of fear!If she could only make up her
mind to do the right thing!She loved him, but she could leave him, and it would be better for
him.Probably her father would live with her if she went back to
Cleveland.He would honor her for at last taking a decent stand.Yet
the thought of leaving Lester was a terrible one to her--he had
been so good.As for her father, she was not sure whether he would
receive her or not.After the tragic visit of Louise she began to think of saving a
little money, laying it aside as best she could from her allowance.Lester was generous and she had been able to send home regularly
fifteen dollars a week to maintain the family--as much as they
had lived on before, without any help from the outside.She spent
twenty dollars to maintain the table, for Lester required the best of
everything--fruits, meats, desserts, liquors, and what not.The
rent was fifty-five dollars, with clothes and extras a varying sum.Lester gave her fifty dollars a week, but somehow it had all gone.She
thought how she might economize but this seemed wrong.Better go without taking anything, if she were going, was the
thought that came to her.She thought over this week after week, after the advent of Louise,
trying to nerve herself to the point where she could speak or act.Lester was consistently generous and kind, but she felt at times that
he himself might wish it.Since the
scene with Louise it seemed to her that he had been a little
different.If she could only say to him that she was not satisfied
with the way she was living, and then leave.But he himself had
plainly indicated after his discovery of Vesta that her feelings on
that score could not matter so very much to him, since he thought the
presence of the child would definitely interfere with his ever
marrying her.It was her presence he wanted on another basis.And he
was so forceful, she could not argue with him very well.She decided
if she went it would be best to write a letter and tell him why.Then
maybe when he knew how she felt he would forgive her and think nothing
more about it.The condition of the Gerhardt family was not improving.Since
Jennie had left Martha had married.After several years of teaching in
the public schools of Cleveland she had met a young architect, and
they were united after a short engagement.Martha had been always a
little ashamed of her family, and now, when this new life dawned, she
was anxious to keep the connection as slight as possible.She barely
notified the members of the family of the approaching
marriage--Jennie not at all--and to the actual ceremony she
invited only Bass and George.Gerhardt, Veronica, and William resented
the slight.She hoped that life would give her an
opportunity to pay her sister off.William, of course, did not mind
particularly.He was interested in the possibilities of becoming an
electrical engineer, a career which one of his school-teachers had
pointed out to him as being attractive and promising.Jennie heard of Martha's marriage after it was all over, a note
from Veronica giving her the main details.She was glad from one point
of view, but realized that her brothers and sisters were drifting away
from her.A little while after Martha's marriage Veronica and William went to
reside with George, a break which was brought about by the attitude of
Gerhardt himself.Ever since his wife's death and the departure of the
other children he had been subject to moods of profound gloom, from
which he was not easily aroused.Life, it seemed, was drawing to a
close for him, although he was only sixty-five years of age.The
earthly ambitions he had once cherished were gone forever.He saw
Sebastian, Martha, and George out in the world practically ignoring
him, contributing nothing at all to a home which should never have
taken a dollar from Jennie.They
objected to leaving school and going to work, apparently preferring to
live on money which Gerhardt had long since concluded was not being
come by honestly.He was now pretty well satisfied as to the true
relations of Jennie and Lester.At first he had believed them to be
married, but the way Lester had neglected Jennie for long periods, the
humbleness with which she ran at his beck and call, her fear of
telling him about Vesta--somehow it all pointed to the same
thing.Gerhardt had never had sight
of her marriage certificate.Since she was away she might have been
married, but he did not believe it.The real trouble was that Gerhardt had grown intensely morose and
crotchety, and it was becoming impossible for young people to live
with him.They resented the way in which
he took charge of the expenditures after Martha left.He accused them
of spending too much on clothes and amusements, he insisted that a
smaller house should be taken, and he regularly sequestered a part of
the money which Jennie sent, for what purpose they could hardly guess.As a matter of fact, Gerhardt was saving as much as possible in order
to repay Jennie eventually.He thought it was sinful to go on in this
way, and this was his one method, out side of his meager earnings, to
redeem himself.If his other children had acted rightly by him he felt
that he would not now be left in his old age the recipient of charity
from one, who, despite her other good qualities, was certainly not
leading a righteous life.It ended one winter month when George agreed to receive his
complaining brother and sister on condition that they should get
something to do.Gerhardt was nonplussed for a moment, but invited
them to take the furniture and go their way.His generosity shamed
them for the moment; they even tentatively invited him to come and
live with them, but this he would not do.He would ask the foreman of
the mill he watched for the privilege of sleeping in some
out-of-the-way garret.And this would
save him a little money.So in a fit of pique he did this, and there was seen the spectacle
of an old man watching through a dreary season of nights, in a lonely
trafficless neighborhood while the city pursued its gaiety elsewhere.He had a wee small corner in the topmost loft of a warehouse away from
the tear and grind of the factory proper.In the afternoon he would take a little walk, strolling toward the
business center, or out along the banks of the Cuyahoga, or the lake.As a rule his hands were below his back, his brow bent in meditation.He would even talk to himself a little--an occasional "By chops!"or "So it is" being indicative of his dreary mood.At dusk he would
return, taking his stand at the lonely gate which was his post of
duty.His meals he secured at a nearby workingmen's boarding-house,
such as he felt he must have.The nature of the old German's reflections at this time were of a
peculiarly subtle and somber character.What did it all come to after the struggle, and the
worry, and the grieving?People die; you hear
nothing more from them.Yet he continued to hold some strongly dogmatic convictions.He
believed there was a hell, and that people who sinned would go there.He believed that both had
sinned woefully.He believed that the just would be rewarded in
heaven.Sebastian
was a good boy, but he was cold, and certainly indifferent to his
father.Take Martha--she was ambitious, but obviously selfish.Somehow the children, outside of Jennie, seemed self-centered.Bass
walked off when he got married, and did nothing more for anybody.Martha insisted that she needed all she made to live on.George had
contributed for a little while, but had finally refused to help out.Veronica and William had been content to live on Jennie's money so
long as he would allow it, and yet they knew it was not right.His
very existence, was it not a commentary on the selfishness of his
children?Life was truly strange, and dark, and uncertain.Still he
did not want to go and live with any of his children.Actually they
were not worthy of him--none but Jennie, and she was not good.This woeful condition of affairs was not made known to Jennie for
some time.She had been sending her letters to Martha, but, on her
leaving, Jennie had been writing directly to Gerhardt.After
Veronica's departure Gerhardt wrote to Jennie saying that there was no
need of sending any more money.Veronica and William were going to
live with George.He himself had a good place in a factory, and would
live there a little while.He returned her a moderate sum that he had
saved--one hundred and fifteen dollars--with the word that
he would not need it.Jennie did not understand, but as the others did not write, she was
not sure but what it might be all right--her father was so
determined.But by degrees, however, a sense of what it really must
mean overtook her--a sense of something wrong, and she worried,
hesitating between leaving Lester and going to see about her father,
whether she left him or not.Yet if she did not get some work which paid well
they would have a difficult time.If she could get five
or six dollars a week they could live.This hundred and fifteen
dollars which Gerhardt had saved would tide them over the worst
difficulties perhaps.CHAPTER XXXVI


The trouble with Jennie's plan was that it did not definitely take
into consideration Lester's attitude.He did care for her in an
elemental way, but he was hedged about by the ideas of the
conventional world in which he had been reared.To say that he loved
her well enough to take her for better or worse--to legalize her
anomalous position and to face the world bravely with the fact that he
had chosen a wife who suited him--was perhaps going a little too
far, but he did really care for her, and he was not in a mood, at this
particular time, to contemplate parting with her for good.Lester was getting along to that time of life when his ideas of
womanhood were fixed and not subject to change.Thus far, on his own
plane and within the circle of his own associates, he had met no one
who appealed to him as did Jennie.She was gentle, intelligent,
gracious, a handmaiden to his every need; and he had taught her the
little customs of polite society, until she was as agreeable a
companion as he cared to have.He was comfortable, he was
satisfied--why seek further?But Jennie's restlessness increased day by day.She tried writing
out her views, and started a half dozen letters before she finally
worded one which seemed, partially at least, to express her feelings.It was a long letter for her, and it ran as follows:

"Lester dear, When you get this I won't be here, and I want you
not to think harshly of me until you have read it all.I am taking
Vesta and leaving, and I think it is really better that I should.You know when you met me we were very poor,
and my condition was such that I didn't think any good man would ever
want me.When you came along and told me you loved me I was hardly
able to think just what I ought to do.You made me love you, Lester,
in spite of myself."You know I told you that I oughtn't to do anything wrong any more
and that I wasn't good, but somehow when you were near me I couldn't
think just right, and I didn't see just how I was to get away from
you.Papa was sick at home that time, and there was hardly anything in
the house to eat.My brother George
didn't have good shoes, and mamma was so worried.I have often
thought, Lester, if mamma had not been compelled to worry so much she
might be alive to-day.I thought if you liked me and I really liked
you--I love you, Lester--maybe it wouldn't make so much
difference about me.You know you told me right away you would like to
help my family, and I felt that maybe that would be the right thing to
do."Lester, dear, I am ashamed to leave you this way; it seems so mean,
but if you knew how I have been feeling these days you would forgive
me.Oh, I love you, Lester, I do, I do.But for months past--ever
since your sister came--I felt that I was doing wrong, and that I
oughtn't to go on doing it, for I know how terribly wrong it is.It
was wrong for me ever to have anything to do with Senator Brander, but
I was such a girl then--I hardly knew what I was doing.It was
wrong of me not to tell you about Vesta when I first met you, though I
thought I was doing right when I did it.It was terribly wrong of me
to keep her here all that time concealed, Lester, but I was afraid of
you then--afraid of what you would say and do.When your sister
Louise came it all came over me somehow, clearly, and I have never
been able to think right about it since.It can't be right, Lester,
but I don't blame you."I don't ask you to marry me, Lester.I know how you feel about me
and how you feel about your family, and I don't think it would be
right.They would never want you to do it, and it isn't right that I
should ask you.At the same time I know I oughtn't to go on living
this way.Vesta is getting along where she understands everything.She
thinks you are her really truly uncle.I have thought of it all so
much.I have thought a number of times that I would try to talk to you
about it, but you frighten me when you get serious, and I don't seem
to be able to say what I want to.So I thought if I could just write
you this and then go you would understand.I know it's for the best for you and for
me.Please forgive me, Lester, please; and don't
think of me any more.But I love you--oh yes, I
do--and I will never be grateful enough for all you have done for
me.I wish you all the luck that can come to you."P. S. I expect to go to Cleveland with papa.It's best that you
shouldn't."She put this in an envelope, sealed it, and, having hidden it in
her bosom, for the time being, awaited the hour when she could
conveniently take her departure.It was several days before she could bring herself to the actual
execution of the plan, but one afternoon, Lester, having telephoned
that he would not be home for a day or two, she packed some necessary
garments for herself and Vesta in several trunks, and sent for an
expressman.She thought of telegraphing her father that she was
coming; but, seeing he had no home, she thought it would be just as
well to go and find him.George and Veronica had not taken all the
furniture.The major portion of it was in storage--so Gerhard t
had written.She might take that and furnish a little home or flat.She was ready for the end, waiting for the expressman, when the door
opened and in walked Lester.For some unforeseen reason he had changed his mind.He was not in
the least psychic or intuitional, but on this occasion his feelings
had served him a peculiar turn.He had thought of going for a day's
duck-shooting with some friends in the Kankakee Marshes south of
Chicago, but had finally changed his mind; he even decided to go out
to the house early.As he neared the house he felt a little peculiar about coming home
so early; then at the sight of the two trunks standing in the middle
of the room he stood dumfounded.What did it mean--Jennie dressed
and ready to depart?He stared in
amazement, his brown eyes keen in inquiry."Why--why--" she began, falling back."I thought I would go to Cleveland," she replied."Why--why--I meant to tell you, Lester, that I didn't
think I ought to stay here any longer this way.I thought I'd tell you, but I couldn't."What the deuce are you talking about?"There," she said, mechanically pointing to a small center-table
where the letter lay conspicuous on a large book."And you were really going to leave me, Jennie, with just a
letter?"said Lester, his voice hardening a little as he spoke."I
swear to heaven you are beyond me.He tore open the
envelope and looked at the beginning."Better send Vesta from the
room," he suggested.Then she came back and stood there pale and wide-eyed,
looking at the wall, at the trunks, and at him.He shifted his position once or twice, then dropped the
paper on the floor."Well, I'll tell you, Jennie," he said finally, looking at her
curiously and wondering just what he was going to say.Here again was
his chance to end this relationship if he wished.He couldn't feel
that he did wish it, seeing how peacefully things were running.They
had gone so far together it seemed ridiculous to quit now.He truly
loved her--there was no doubt of that.Still he did not want to
marry her--could not very well."You have this thing wrong," he went on slowly."I don't know
what comes over you at times, but you don't view the situation right.I've told you before that I can't marry you--not now, anyhow.There are too many big things involved in this, which you don't know
anything about.But my family has to be
taken into consideration, and the business.You can't see the
difficulties raised on these scores, but I can.Now I don't want you
to leave me.I can't prevent you, of
course.But I don't think you ought to want
to.Jennie, who had been counting on getting away without being seen,
was now thoroughly nonplussed.To have him begin a quiet
argument--a plea as it were.He, Lester, pleading
with her, and she loved him so.She went over to him, and he took her hand."There's really nothing to be gained by
your leaving me at present."Well, how did you expect to get along?""I thought I'd take papa, if he'd come with me--he's alone
now--and get something to do, maybe.""Well, what can you do, Jennie, different from what you ever have
done?You wouldn't expect to be a lady's maid again, would you?"I thought I might get some place as a housekeeper," she suggested.She had been counting up her possibilities, and this was the most
promising idea that had occurred to her."No, no," he grumbled, shaking his head.There's nothing in this whole move of yours except a notion.Why, you
won't be any better off morally than you are right now.It doesn't make any difference, anyhow.I might in the future, but I can't tell anything about that, and
I don't want to promise anything.You're not going to leave me though
with my consent, and if you were going I wouldn't have you dropping
back into any such thing as you're contemplating.I'll make some
provision for you.You don't really want to leave me, do you,
Jennie?"Against Lester's strong personality and vigorous protest Jennie's
own conclusions and decisions went to pieces.Just the pressure of his
hand was enough to upset her."Don't cry, Jennie," he said."This thing may work out better than
you think.You're not
going to leave me any more, are you?""Let things rest as they are," he went on.I'm putting up with some things myself that I ordinarily
wouldn't stand for."He finally saw her restored to comparative calmness, smiling sadly
through her tears."Now you put those things away," he said genially, pointing to the
trunks."Besides, I want you to promise me one thing.""No more concealment of anything, do you hear?No more thinking
things out for yourself, and acting without my knowing anything about
it.If you have anything on your mind, I want you to come out with it.I'll help you solve it, or, if I can't, at least there won't be any
concealment between us.""I know, Lester," she said earnestly, looking him straight in the
eyes."I promise I'll never conceal anything any more--truly I
won't.I've been afraid, but I won't be now."That sounds like what you ought to be," he replied.A few days later, and in consequence of this agreement, the future
of Gerhardt came up for discussion.Jennie had been worrying about him
for several days; now it occurred to her that this was something to
talk over with Lester.Accordingly, she explained one night at dinner
what had happened in Cleveland."I know he is very unhappy there all
alone," she said, "and I hate to think of it.I was going to get him
if I went back to Cleveland.Now I don't know what to do about
it.""Why don't you send him some money?""He won't take any more money from me, Lester," she explained."He
thinks I'm not good--not acting right."He has pretty good reason, hasn't he?""I hate to think of him sleeping in a factory.He's so old and
lonely.""What's the matter with the rest of the family in Cleveland?Won't
they do anything for him?"I think maybe they don't want him, he's so cross," she said
simply."I hardly know what to suggest in that case," smiled Lester."The
old gentleman oughtn't to be so fussy.""I know," she said, "but he's old now, and he has had so much
trouble."Lester ruminated for a while, toying with his fork."I'll tell you
what I've been thinking, Jennie," he said finally."There's no use
living this way any longer, if we're going to stick it out.I've been
thinking that we might take a house out in Hyde Park.It's something
of a run from the office, but I'm not much for this apartment life.You and Vesta would be better off for a yard.In that case you might
bring your father on to live with us.He couldn't do any harm
pottering about; indeed, he might help keep things straight.""Oh, that would just suit papa, if he'd come," she replied."He
loves to fix things, and he'd cut the grass and look after the
furnace.But he won't come unless he's sure I'm married.""I don't know how that could be arranged unless you could show the
old gentleman a marriage certificate.He seems to want something that
can't be produced very well.A steady job he'd have running the
furnace of a country house," he added meditatively.Jennie did not notice the grimness of the jest.She was too busy
thinking what a tangle she had made of her life.Gerhardt would not
come now, even if they had a lovely home to share with him.And yet he
ought to be with Vesta again.She remained lost in a sad abstraction, until Lester, following the
drift of her thoughts, said: "I don't see how it can be arranged.Marriage certificate blanks aren't easily procurable.It's bad
business--a criminal offense to forge one, I believe.I wouldn't
want to be mixed up in that sort of thing.""Oh, I don't want you to do anything like that, Lester.I'm just
sorry papa is so stubborn.When he gets a notion you can't change
him.""Suppose we wait until we get settled after moving," he suggested."Then you can go to Cleveland and talk to him personally.It was
so decent that he rather wished he could help her carry out her
scheme.While not very interesting, Gerhardt was not objectionable to
Lester, and if the old man wanted to do the odd jobs around a big
place, why not?CHAPTER XXXVII


The plan for a residence in Hyde Park was not long in taking shape.After several weeks had passed, and things had quieted down again,
Lester invited Jennie to go with him to South Hyde Park to look for a
house.On the first trip they found something which seemed to suit
admirably--an old-time home of eleven large rooms, set in a lawn
fully two hundred feet square and shaded by trees which had been
planted when the city was young.It was ornate, homelike, peaceful.Jennie was fascinated by the sense of space and country, although
depressed by the reflection that she was not entering her new home
under the right auspices.She had vaguely hoped that in planning to go
away she was bringing about a condition under which Lester might have
come after her and married her.She had
promised to stay, and she would have to make the best of it.She
suggested that they would never know what to do with so much room, but
he waved that aside."We will very likely have people in now and
then," he said."We can furnish it up anyhow, and see how it looks."He had the agent make out a five-year lease, with an option for
renewal, and set at once the forces to work to put the establishment
in order.The house was painted and decorated, the lawn put in order, and
everything done to give the place a trim and satisfactory appearance.There was a large, comfortable library and sitting-room, a big
dining-room, a handsome reception-hall, a parlor, a large kitchen,
serving-room, and in fact all the ground-floor essentials of a
comfortable home.On the second floor were bedrooms, baths, and the
maid's room.It was all very comfortable and harmonious, and Jennie
took an immense pride and pleasure in getting things in order.Immediately after moving in, Jennie, with Lester's permission,
wrote to her father asking him to come to her.She did not say that
she was married, but left it to be inferred.She descanted on the
beauty of the neighborhood, the size of the yard, and the manifold
conveniences of the establishment."It is so very nice," she added,
"you would like it, papa.Vesta is here and goes to school every day.Won't you come and stay with us?It's so much better than living in a
factory.Gerhardt read this letter with a solemn countenance, Was it really
true?Would they be taking a larger house if they were not permanently
united?Well, it was high time--but should he go?He had lived
alone this long time now--should he go to Chicago and live with
Jennie?Her appeal did touch him, but somehow he decided against it.That would be too generous an acknowledgment of the fact that there
had been fault on his side as well as on hers.Jennie was disappointed at Gerhardt's refusal.She talked it over
with Lester, and decided that she would go on to Cleveland and see
him.Accordingly, she made the trip, hunted up the factory, a great
rumbling furniture concern in one of the poorest sections of the city,
and inquired at the office for her father.The clerk directed her to a
distant warehouse, and Gerhardt was informed that a lady wished to see
him.He crawled out of his humble cot and came down, curious as to who
it could be.When Jennie saw him in his dusty, baggy clothes, his hair
gray, his eye brows shaggy, coming out of the dark door, a keen sense
of the pathetic moved her again.He came
toward her, his inquisitorial eye softened a little by his
consciousness of the affection that had inspired her visit."I want you to come home with me, papa," she pleaded yearningly."I
don't want you to stay here any more.I can't think of you living
alone any longer.""So," he said, nonplussed, "that brings you?""Yes," she replied; "Won't you?"I have a good bed," he explained by way of apology for his
state."I know," she replied, "but we have a good home now and Vesta is
there."Yes," she replied, lying hopelessly."I have been married a long
time.She could scarcely look him
in the face, but she managed somehow, and he believed her."Well," he said, "it is time.""Won't you come, papa?"He threw out his hands after his characteristic manner.The urgency
of her appeal touched him to the quick."Yes, I come," he said, and
turned; but she saw by his shoulders what was happening.For answer he walked back into the dark warehouse to get his
things.CHAPTER XXXVIII


Gerhardt, having become an inmate of the Hyde Park home, at once
bestirred himself about the labors which he felt instinctively
concerned him.He took charge of the furnace and the yard, outraged at
the thought that good money should be paid to any outsider when he had
nothing to do.The trees, he declared to Jennie, were in a dreadful
condition.If Lester would get him a pruning knife and a saw he would
attend to them in the spring.In Germany they knew how to care for
such things, but these Americans were so shiftless.Then he wanted
tools and nails, and in time all the closets and shelves were put in
order.He found a Lutheran Church almost two miles away, and declared
that it was better than the one in Cleveland.The pastor, of course,
was a heaven-sent son of divinity.And nothing would do but that Vesta
must go to church with him regularly.Jennie and Lester settled down into the new order of living with
some misgivings; certain difficulties were sure to arise.On the North
Side it had been easy for Jennie to shun neighbors and say nothing.Now they were occupying a house of some pretensions; their immediate
neighbors would feel it their duty to call, and Jennie would have to
play the part of an experienced hostess.She and Lester had talked
this situation over.It might as well be understood here, he said,
that they were husband and wife.Vesta was to be introduced as
Jennie's daughter by her first marriage, her husband, a Mr.Stover
(her mother's maiden name), having died immediately after the child's
birth.Lester, of course, was the stepfather.This particular
neighborhood was so far from the fashionable heart of Chicago that
Lester did not expect to run into many of his friends.He explained to
Jennie the ordinary formalities of social intercourse, so that when
the first visitor called Jennie might be prepared to receive her.Within a fortnight this first visitor arrived in the person of Mrs.Jacob Stendahl, a woman of considerable importance in this particular
section.She lived five doors from Jennie--the houses of the
neighborhood were all set in spacious lawns--and drove up in her
carriage, on her return from her shopping, one afternoon.she asked of Jeannette, the new maid."I think so, mam," answered the girl."Won't you let me have your
card?"The card was given and taken to Jennie, who looked at it
curiously.When Jennie came into the parlor Mrs.Stendahl, a tall dark,
inquisitive-looking woman, greeted her most cordially."I thought I would take the liberty of intruding on you," she said
most winningly.I live on the other side
of the street, some few doors up.Perhaps you have seen the
house--the one with the white stone gate-posts.""Oh, yes indeed," replied Jennie.Kane and I
were admiring it the first day we came out here.""I know of your husband, of course, by reputation.My husband is
connected with the Wilkes Frog and Switch Company."She knew that the latter concern must be
something important and profitable from the way in which Mrs."We have lived here quite a number of years, and I know how you
must feel coming as a total stranger to a new section of the city.I
hope you will find time to come in and see me some afternoon."Indeed I shall," answered Jennie, a little nervously, for the
ordeal was a trying one.Kane is very busy as a rule, but when he is at home I am sure he would
be most pleased to meet you and your husband.""You must both come over some evening," replied Mrs.Jennie smiled her assurances of good-will.Stendahl to the door, and shook hands with her."I'm so glad to find
you so charming," observed Mrs."Oh, thank you," said Jennie flushing a little."I'm sure I don't
deserve so much praise.""Well, now I will expect you some afternoon.Good-by," and she
waved a gracious farewell."That wasn't so bad," thought Jennie as she watched Mrs.Timothy Ballinger--all of whom left
cards, or stayed to chat a few minutes.Jennie found herself taken
quite seriously as a woman of importance, and she did her best to
support the dignity of her position.And, indeed, she did
exceptionally well.She had a
kindly smile and a manner wholly natural; she succeeded in making a
most favorable impression.She explained to her guests that she had
been living on the North Side until recently, that her husband,
Mr.Kane, had long wanted to have a home in Hyde Park, that her father
and daughter were living here, and that Lester was the child's
stepfather.She said she hoped to repay all these nice attentions and
to be a good neighbor.Lester heard about these calls in the evening, for he did not care
to meet these people.Jennie came to enjoy it in a mild way.She liked
making new friends, and she was hoping that something definite could
be worked out here which would make Lester look upon her as a good
wife and an ideal companion.Perhaps, some day, he might really want
to marry her.First impressions are not always permanent, as Jennie was soon to
discover.The neighborhood had accepted her perhaps a little too
hastily, and now rumors began to fly about.Sommerville,
calling on Mrs.Craig, one of Jennie's near neighbors, intimated that
she knew who Lester was--"oh, yes, indeed.You know, my dear,"
she went on, "his reputation is just a little--" she raised her
eyebrows and her hand at the same time."He looks like
such a staid, conservative person.""Oh, no doubt, in a way, he is," went on Mrs."His
family is of the very best.There was some young woman he went
with--so my husband tells me.I don't know whether this is the
one or not, but she was introduced as a Miss Gorwood, or some such
name as that, when they were living together as husband and wife on
the North Side."Craig with her tongue at this
astonishing news.Come to think of it, it must be
the same woman.It
seems to me that there was some earlier scandal in connection with
her--at least there was a child.Whether he married her afterward
or not, I don't know.Anyhow, I understand his family will not have
anything to do with her.""And to think he
should have married her afterward, if he really did.I'm sure you
can't tell with whom you're coming in contact these days, can
you?""Well, it may be," went on her guest, "that this isn't the same
woman after all.She told me they had been living
on the North Side.""Then I'm sure it's the same person.How curious that you should
speak of her!""It is, indeed," went on Mrs.Craig, who was speculating as to what
her attitude toward Jennie should be in the future.There were people who had
seen Jennie and Lester out driving on the North Side, who had been
introduced to her as Miss Gerhardt, who knew what the Kane family
thought.Of course her present position, the handsome house, the
wealth of Lester, the beauty of Vesta--all these things helped to
soften the situation.She was apparently too circumspect, too much the
good wife and mother, too really nice to be angry with; but she had a
past, and that had to be taken into consideration.An opening bolt of the coming storm fell upon Jennie one day when
Vesta, returning from school, suddenly asked: "Mamma, who was my
papa?""His name was Stover, dear," replied her mother, struck at once by
the thought that there might have been some criticism--that some
one must have been saying something.continued Vesta, ignoring the last inquiry, and
interested in clearing up her own identity."Anita Ballinger said I didn't have any papa, and that you weren't
ever married when you had me.She said I wasn't a really, truly girl
at all--just a nobody.Ballinger had called, and Jennie had thought her peculiarly gracious
and helpful in her offer of assistance, and now her little daughter
had said this to Vesta."You mustn't pay any attention to her, dearie," said Jennie at
last.Stover, and you were born
in Columbus.Of course they say
nasty things when they fight--sometimes things they don't really
mean.Just let her alone and don't go near her any more.Then she
won't say anything to you."It was a lame explanation, but it satisfied Vesta for the time
being."I'll slap her if she tries to slap me," she persisted."You mustn't go near her, pet, do you hear?Then she can't try to
slap you," returned her mother."Just go about your studies, and don't
mind her.She can't quarrel with you if you don't let her."Vesta went away leaving Jennie brooding over her words.It is one thing to nurse a single thrust, another to have the wound
opened from time to time by additional stabs.One day Jennie, having
gone to call on Mrs.Hanson Field, who was her immediate neighbor, met
a Mrs.Williston Baker, who was there taking tea.Baker knew of
the Kanes, of Jennie's history on the North Side, and of the attitude
of the Kane family.She was a thin, vigorous, intellectual woman,
somewhat on the order of Mrs.Bracebridge, and very careful of her
social connections.Field a woman of
the same rigid circumspectness of attitude, and when she found Jennie
calling there she was outwardly calm but inwardly irritated.Field, introducing her guests with a
smiling countenance."Indeed," she went on freezingly."I've heard a great deal about
Mrs.--" accenting the word "Mrs.--Lester Kane."Field, ignoring Jennie completely, and started
an intimate conversation in which Jennie could have no possible share.Jennie stood helplessly by, unable to formulate a thought which would
be suitable to so trying a situation.Baker soon announced her
departure, although she had intended to stay longer."I can't remain
another minute," she said; "I promised Mrs.Neil that I would stop in
to see her to-day.I'm sure I've bored you enough already as it
is."She walked to the door, not troubling to look at Jennie until she
was nearly out of the room.Then she looked in her direction, and gave
her a frigid nod."We meet such curious people now and again," she observed finally
to her hostess as she swept away.Field did not feel able to defend Jennie, for she herself was
in no notable social position, and was endeavoring, like every other
middle-class woman of means, to get along.Williston Baker, who was socially so much more important than
Jennie.She came back to where Jennie was sitting, smiling
apologetically, but she was a little bit flustered.Jennie was out of
countenance, of course.Presently she excused herself and went home.She had been cut deeply by the slight offered her, and she felt that
Mrs.Field realized that she had made a mistake in ever taking her up.There would be no additional exchange of visits there--that she
knew.The old hopeless feeling came over her that her life was a
failure.It couldn't be made right, or, if it could, it wouldn't be.Lester was not inclined to marry her and put her right.Time went on and matters remained very much as they were.To look
at this large house, with its smooth lawn and well grown trees, its
vines clambering about the pillars of the veranda and interlacing
themselves into a transparent veil of green; to see Gerhardt pottering
about the yard, Vesta coming home from school, Lester leaving in the
morning in his smart trap--one would have said that here is peace
and plenty, no shadow of unhappiness hangs over this charming
home.And as a matter of fact existence with Lester and Jennie did run
smoothly.It is true that the neighbors did not call any more, or only
a very few of them, and there was no social life to speak of; but the
deprivation was hardly noticed; there was so much in the home life to
please and interest.Vesta was learning to play the piano, and to play
quite well.Jennie was a charming figure
in blue, lavender, and olive-green house-gowns as she went about her
affairs, sewing, dusting, getting Vesta off to school, and seeing that
things generally were put to rights.Gerhardt busied himself about his
multitudinous duties, for he was not satisfied unless he had his hands
into all the domestic economies of the household.One of his
self-imposed tasks was to go about the house after Lester, or the
servants, turning out the gas-jets or electric-light bulbs which might
accidentally have been left burning.Again, Lester's expensive clothes, which he carelessly threw aside
after a few month's use, were a source of woe to the thrifty old
German.Moreover, he grieved over splendid shoes discarded because of
a few wrinkles in the leather or a slightly run down heel or sole.Gerhardt was for having them repaired, but Lester answered the old
man's querulous inquiry as to what was wrong "with them shoes" by
saying that they weren't comfortable any more.No
good can come of anything like that, It will mean want one of these
days.""He can't help it, papa," Jennie excused."That's the way he was
raised."These Americans, they know nothing of
economy.Then they would know
what a dollar can do."Lester heard something of this through Jennie, but he only smiled.Another grievance was Lester's extravagant use of matches.He had
the habit of striking a match, holding it while he talked, instead of
lighting his cigar, and then throwing it away.Sometimes he would
begin to light a cigar two or three minutes before he would actually
do so, tossing aside match after match.There was a place out in one
corner of the veranda where he liked to sit of a spring or summer
evening, smoking and throwing away half-burned matches.Jennie would
sit with him, and a vast number of matches would be lit and flung out
on the lawn.At one time, while engaged in cutting the grass, Gerhardt
found, to his horror, not a handful, but literally boxes of
half-burned match-sticks lying unconsumed and decaying under the
fallen blades.He gathered up
this damning evidence in a newspaper and carried it back into the
sitting-room where Jennie was sewing.That man,
he has no more sense of economy than a--than a--" the right
term failed him."He sits and smokes, and this is the way he uses
matches.Five cents a box they cost--five cents.How can a man
hope to do well and carry on like that, I like to know."Lester is extravagant," she
said.At least they should be
burned in the furnace.He would have used them as lighters for his own
pipe, sticking them in the fire to catch a blaze, only old newspapers
were better, and he had stacks of these--another evidence of his
lord and master's wretched, spendthrift disposition.It was a sad
world to work in.Still he fought
as valiantly as he could against waste and shameless extravagance.He would wear the same suit of
black--cut down from one of Lester's expensive investments of
years before--every Sunday for a couple of years.Lester's shoes,
by a little stretch of the imagination, could be made to seem to fit,
and these he wore.His old ties also--the black ones--they
were fine.If he could have cut down Lester's shirts he would have
done so; he did make over the underwear, with the friendly aid of the
cook's needle.Lester's socks, of course, were just right.There was
never any expense for Gerhardt's clothing.The remaining stock of Lester's discarded clothing--shoes,
shirts, collars, suits, ties, and what not--he would store away
for weeks and months, and then, in a sad and gloomy frame of mind, he
would call in a tailor, or an old-shoe man, or a ragman, and dispose
of the lot at the best price he could.He learned that all second-hand
clothes men were sharks; that there was no use in putting the least
faith in the protests of any rag dealer or old-shoe man.They all claimed to be very poor, when as a matter of fact they
were actually rolling in wealth.Gerhardt had investigated these
stories; he had followed them up; he had seen what they were doing
with the things he sold them."They offer me ten cents for a pair of
shoes, and then I see them hanging out in front of their places marked
two dollars.They could afford to give me a
dollar."It was only to her that he complained, for he could
expect no sympathy from' Lester.So far as his own meager store of
money was concerned, he gave the most of it to his beloved church,
where he was considered to be a model of propriety, honesty,
faith--in fact, the embodiment of all the virtues.And so, for all the ill winds that were beginning to blow socially,
Jennie was now leading the dream years of her existence.Lester, in
spite of the doubts which assailed him at times as to the wisdom of
his career, was invariably kind and considerate, and he seemed to
enjoy his home life.she would ask when he came in of an
evening.he would answer, and pinch her chin or cheek.She would follow him in while Jeannette, always alert, would take
his coat and hat.In the winter-time they would sit in the library
before the big grate-fire.In the spring, summer, or fall Lester
preferred to walk out on the porch, one corner of which commanded a
sweeping view of the lawn and the distant street, and light his
before-dinner cigar.Jennie would sit on the side of his chair and
stroke his head."Your hair is not getting the least bit thin, Lester;
aren't you glad?"she would say; or, "Oh, see how your brow is
wrinkled now.You didn't change your tie, mister,
this morning."Oh, I forgot," he would answer, or he would cause the wrinkles to
disappear, or laughingly predict that he would soon be getting bald if
he wasn't so now.In the drawing-room or library, before Vesta and Gerhardt, she was
not less loving, though a little more circumspect.She loved odd
puzzles like pigs in clover, the spider's hole, baby billiards, and
the like.He would work by
the hour, if necessary, to make a difficult puzzle come right.Jennie
was clever at solving these mechanical problems.Sometimes she would
have to show him the right method, and then she would be immensely
pleased with herself.At other times she would stand behind him
watching, her chin on his shoulder, her arms about his neck.He seemed
not to mind--indeed, he was happy in the wealth of affection she
bestowed.Her cleverness, her gentleness, her tact created an
atmosphere which was immensely pleasing; above all her youth and
beauty appealed to him.It made him feel young, and if there was one
thing Lester objected to, it was the thought of drying up into an
aimless old age."I want to keep young, or die young," was one of his
pet remarks; and Jennie came to understand.She was glad that she was
so much younger now for his sake.Another pleasant feature of the home life was Lester's steadily
increasing affection for Vesta.The child would sit at the big table
in the library in the evening conning her books, while Jennie would
sew, and Gerhardt would read his interminable list of German Lutheran
papers.It grieved the old man that Vesta should not be allowed to go
to a German Lutheran parochial school, but Lester would listen to
nothing of the sort."We'll not have any thick-headed German training
in this," he said to Jennie, when she suggested that Gerhardt had
complained."The public schools are good enough for any child.There were really some delightful hours among the four.Lester
liked to take the little seven-year-old school-girl between his knees
and tease her.He liked to invert the so-called facts of life, to
propound its paradoxes, and watch how the child's budding mind took
them.he would ask; and being informed that it was
"what we drink," he would stare and say, "That's so, but what is it?Don't they teach you any better than that?""Well, it is what we drink, isn't it?""The fact that we drink it doesn't explain what it is," he would
retort."You ask your teacher what water is"; and then he would leave
her with this irritating problem troubling her young soul.Food, china, her dress, anything was apt to be brought back to its
chemical constituents, and he would leave her to struggle with these
dark suggestions of something else back of the superficial appearance
of things until she was actually in awe of him.She had a way of
showing him how nice she looked before she started to school in the
morning, a habit that arose because of his constant criticism of her
appearance.He wanted her to look smart, he insisted on a big bow of
blue ribbon for her hair, he demanded that her shoes be changed from
low quarter to high boots with the changing character of the seasons'
and that her clothing be carried out on a color scheme suited to her
complexion and disposition."That child's light and gay by disposition.Don't put anything
somber on her," he once remarked.Jennie had come to realize that he must be consulted in this, and
would say, "Run to your papa and show him how you look."Vesta would come and turn briskly around before him, saying,
"See."He grew so proud of her that on Sundays and some week-days when
they drove he would always have her in between them.He insisted that
Jennie send her to dancing-school, and Gerhardt was beside himself
with rage and grief."Such
devil's fol-de-rol.To make a no-good
out of her--a creature to be ashamed of?""Oh no, papa," replied Jennie.A fine lot he knows about what is good
for a child.A card-player, a whisky-drinker!""Now, hush, papa; I won't have you talk like that," Jennie would
reply warmly."He's a good man, and you know it."When Lester was near he said nothing, and
Vesta could wind him around her finger."Oh you," she would say, pulling at his arm or rubbing his grizzled
cheek.There was no more fight in Gerhardt when Vesta did this.He
lost control of himself--something welled up and choked his
throat."Yes, I know how you do," he would exclaim.It was noticeable, however, that she did not have to stop unless
she herself willed it.Gerhardt adored the child, and she could do
anything with him; he was always her devoted servitor.CHAPTER XXXIX


During this period the dissatisfaction of the Kane family with
Lester's irregular habit of life grew steadily stronger.That it could
not help but become an open scandal, in the course of time, was
sufficiently obvious to them.People
seemed to understand in a wise way, though nothing was ever said
directly.Kane senior could scarcely imagine what possessed his son to
fly in the face of conventions in this manner.If the woman had been
some one of distinction--some sorceress of the stage, or of the
world of art, or letters, his action would have been explicable if not
commendable, but with this creature of very ordinary capabilities, as
Louise had described her, this putty-faced nobody--he could not
possibly understand it.Lester was his son, his favorite son; it was too bad that he had
not settled down in the ordinary way.Look at the women in Cincinnati
who knew him and liked him.Why in the
name of common sense had he not married her?She was good looking,
sympathetic, talented.The old man grieved bitterly, and then, by
degrees, he began to harden.It seemed a shame that Lester should
treat him so.It wasn't natural, or justifiable, or decent.Archibald
Kane brooded over it until he felt that some change ought to be
enforced, but just what it should be he could not say.Lester was his
own boss, and he would resent any criticism of his actions.Certain changes helped along an approaching denouement.Louise
married not many months after her very disturbing visit to Chicago,
and then the home property was fairly empty except for visiting
grandchildren.Lester did not attend the wedding, though he was
invited.Kane died, making a readjustment of
the family will necessary.Lester came home on this occasion, grieved
to think he had lately seen so little of his mother--that he had
caused her so much pain--but he had no explanation to make.His
father thought at the time of talking to him, but put it off because
of his obvious gloom.He went back to Chicago, and there were more
months of silence.Kane's death and Louise's marriage, the father went to
live with Robert, for his three grandchildren afforded him his
greatest pleasure in his old age.The business, except for the final
adjustment which would come after his death, was in Robert's hands.The latter was consistently agreeable to his sisters and their
husbands and to his father, in view of the eventual control he hoped
to obtain.He was not a sycophant in any sense of the word, but a
shrewd, cold business man, far shrewder than his brother gave him
credit for.He was already richer than any two of the other children
put together, but he chose to keep his counsel and to pretend modesty
of fortune.He realized the danger of envy, and preferred a Spartan
form of existence, putting all the emphasis on inconspicuous but very
ready and very hard cash.While Lester was drifting Robert was
working--working all the time.Robert's scheme for eliminating his brother from participation in
the control of the business was really not very essential, for his
father, after long brooding over the details of the Chicago situation,
had come to the definite conclusion that any large share of his
property ought not to go to Lester.Obviously, Lester was not so
strong a man as he had thought him to be.Of the two brothers, Lester
might be the bigger intellectually or
sympathetically--artistically and socially there was no
comparison--but Robert got commercial results in a silent,
effective way.If Lester was not going to pull himself together at
this stage of the game, when would he?Better leave his property to
those who would take care of it.Archibald Kane thought seriously of
having his lawyer revise his will in such a way that, unless Lester
should reform, he would be cut off with only a nominal income.But he
decided to give Lester one more chance--to make a plea, in fact,
that he should abandon his false way of living, and put himself on a
sound basis before the world.Old
Archibald wrote Lester that he would like to have a talk with him at
his convenience, and within the lapse of thirty-six hours Lester was
in Cincinnati."I thought I'd have one more talk with you, Lester, on a subject
that's rather difficult for me to bring up," began the elder Kane."Yes, I know," replied Lester, calmly."I used to think, when I was much younger that my son's matrimonial
ventures would never concern me, but I changed my views on that score
when I got a little farther along.I began to see through my business
connections how much the right sort of a marriage helps a man, and
then I got rather anxious that my boys should marry well.I used to
worry about you, Lester, and I'm worrying yet.This recent connection
you've made has caused me no end of trouble.It worried your mother up
to the very last.Don't you think you
have gone far enough with it?What
it is in Chicago I don't know, but it can't be a secret.That can't
help the house in business there.The
whole thing has gone on so long that you have injured your prospects
all around, and yet you continue."I suppose because I love her," Lester replied."You can't be serious in that," said his father."If you had loved
her, you'd have married her in the first place.Surely you wouldn't
take a woman and live with her as you have with this woman for years,
disgracing her and yourself, and still claim that you love her.You
may have a passion for her, but it isn't love.""How do you know I haven't married her?"He
wanted to see how his father would take to that idea.The old gentleman propped himself up on his
arms and looked at him."No, I'm not," replied Lester, "but I might be.I can't believe a man of your intelligence would do a thing like that,
Lester.Why, you've lived in open adultery
with her for years, and now you talk of marrying her.Why, in heaven's
name, if you were going to do anything like that, didn't you do it in
the first place?Disgrace your parents, break your mother's heart,
injure the business, become a public scandal, and then marry the cause
of it?"Don't get excited, father," said Lester quickly."We won't get
anywhere that way.She's not a bad woman, and
I wish you wouldn't talk about her as you do."I know enough," insisted old Archibald, determinedly."I know that
no good woman would act as she has done.Why, man, she's after your
money.It's as plain as the nose on your
face.""Father," said Lester, his voice lowering ominously, "why do you
talk like that?You wouldn't know her from
Adam's off ox.Louise comes down here and gives an excited report, and
you people swallow it whole.She isn't as bad as you think she is, and
I wouldn't use the language you're using about her if I were you.You're doing a good woman an injustice, and you won't, for some
reason, be fair."Is it
fair to me, to your family, to your dead mother to take a woman of the
streets and live with her?Is it--"

"Stop now, father," exclaimed Lester, putting up his hand.You're talking about the woman
that I'm living with--that I may marry.I love you, but I won't
have you saying things that aren't so.She isn't a woman of the
streets.You know, as well as you know anything, that I wouldn't take
up with a woman of that kind.We'll have to discuss this in a calmer
mood, or I won't stay here.But I won't
listen to any such language as that."In spite of his opposition, he
respected his son's point of view.He sat back in his chair and stared
at the floor."No, we've moved out to Hyde Park."Well, that's a God's blessing.""I didn't say that," replied his son.exclaimed his father, his anger bubbling again.How do you
suppose I can seriously contemplate entrusting any share of my fortune
to a man who has so little regard for what the world considers as
right and proper?Why, Lester, this carriage business, your family,
your personal reputation appear to be as nothing at all to you.I
can't understand what has happened to your pride.It seems like some
wild, impossible fancy.""It's pretty hard to explain, father, and I can't do it very well.I simply know that I'm in this affair, and that I'm bound to see it
through.I'm not prepared now to say what I'll do.Old Archibald merely shook his head disapprovingly."You've made a bad mess of this, Lester," he said finally.But I suppose you are determined to go your way.Nothing
that I have said appears to move you.""Well, I warn you, then, that, unless you show some consideration
for the dignity of your family and the honor of your position it will
make a difference in my will.I can't go on countenancing this thing,
and not be a party to it morally and every other way.You can leave her, or you can marry her.You certainly ought to do one
or the other.If you leave her, everything will be all right.You can
make any provision for her you like.I'll
gladly pay whatever you agree to.You will share with the rest of the
children, just as I had planned.If you marry her it will make a
difference.I'm doing what I think is my bounden duty.Now you think
that over and let me know."He felt that
his father probably meant what he said, but how could he leave Jennie,
and justify himself to himself?The old gentleman loved him even now--he could see
it.Lester felt troubled and distressed; this attempt at coercion
irritated him.The idea--he, Lester Kane, being made to do such a
thing to throw Jennie down.Old Archibald saw that he had let fly a telling bullet."Well," said Lester finally, "there's no use of our discussing it
any further now--that's certain, isn't it?I can't say what I'll
do.Lester was sorry for the world's
attitude and for his father's keen feeling about the affair.Kane
senior was sorry for his son, but he was determined to see the thing
through.He wasn't sure whether he had converted Lester or not, but he
was hopeful."Good-by, father," said Lester, holding out his hand."I think I'll
try and make that two-ten train.There isn't anything else you wanted
to see me about?"The old man sat there after Lester had gone, thinking deeply.What a foolhardy
persistence in evil and error!He
was the one to control a business.It was a long time
before he stirred.And still, in the bottom of his heart, his erring
son continued to appeal to him.CHAPTER XL


Lester returned to Chicago.He realized that he had offended his
father seriously, how seriously he could not say.In all his personal
relations with old Archibald he had never seen him so worked up.But
even now Lester did not feel that the breach was irreparable; he
hardly realized that it was necessary for him to act decisively if he
hoped to retain his father's affection and confidence.As for the
world at large, what did it matter how much people talked or what they
said.People turn so
quickly from weakness or the shadow of it.To get away from
failure--even the mere suspicion of it--that seems to be a
subconscious feeling with the average man and woman; we all avoid
non-success as though we fear that it may prove contagious.Lester was
soon to feel the force of this prejudice.One day Lester happened to run across Berry Dodge, the millionaire
head of Dodge, Holbrook & Kingsbury, a firm that stood in the
dry-goods world, where the Kane Company stood in the carriage world.Dodge had been one of Lester's best friends.He knew him as intimately
as he knew Henry Bracebridge, of Cleveland, and George Knowles, of
Cincinnati.He visited at his handsome home on the North Shore Drive,
and they met constantly in a business and social way.But since Lester
had moved out to Hyde Park, the old intimacy had lapsed.Now they came
face to face on Michigan Avenue near the Kane building."Why, Lester, I'm glad to see you again," said Dodge.He extended a formal hand, and seemed just a little cool."I hear
you've gone and married since I saw you.""No, nothing like that," replied Lester, easily, with the air of
one who prefers to be understood in the way of the world sense."Why so secret about it, if you have?"asked Dodge, attempting to
smile, but with a wry twist to the corners of his mouth.He was trying
to be nice, and to go through a difficult situation gracefully."We
fellows usually make a fuss about that sort of thing."Well," said Lester, feeling the edge of the social blade that was
being driven into him, "I thought I'd do it in a new way.I'm not much
for excitement in that direction, anyhow.""It is a matter of taste, isn't it?""You're living in the city, of course?"And he
deftly changed the subject before waving him a perfunctory
farewell.Lester missed at once the inquiries which a man like Dodge would
have made if he had really believed that he was married.Under
ordinary circumstances his friend would have wanted to know a great
deal about the new Mrs.There would have been all those little
familiar touches common to people living on the same social plane.Dodge would have asked Lester to bring his wife over to see them,
would have definitely promised to call.Nothing of the sort happened,
and Lester noticed the significant omission.It was the same with the Burnham Moores, the Henry Aldriches, and a
score of other people whom he knew equally well.Apparently they all
thought that he had married and settled down.They were interested to
know where he was living, and they were rather disposed to joke him
about being so very secretive on the subject, but they were not
willing to discuss the supposed Mrs.He was beginning to see
that this move of his was going to tell against him notably.One of the worst stabs--it was the cruelest because, in a way,
it was the most unintentional--he received from an old
acquaintance, Will Whitney, at the Union Club.Lester was dining there
one evening, and Whitney met him in the main reading-room as he was
crossing from the cloak-room to the cigar-stand.The latter was a
typical society figure, tall, lean, smooth-faced, immaculately garbed,
a little cynical, and to-night a little the worse for liquor.he called out, "what's this talk about a menage
of yours out in Hyde Park?How are you going
to explain all this to your wife when you get married?""I don't have to explain it," replied Lester irritably."Why should
you be so interested in my affairs?You're not living in a stone
house, are you?"that's pretty good now, isn't it?You didn't marry
that little beauty you used to travel around with on the North Side,
did you?You didn't, now,
did you?""Cut it out, Whitney," said Lester roughly."Pardon, Lester," said the other aimlessly, but sobering.Eight whisky-sours
straight in the other room there.I'll talk to you some time
when I'm all right.I'm a little loose,
that's right.Lester could not get over that cacophonous "ha!It cut him,
even though it came from a drunken man's mouth."That little beauty
you used to travel with on the North Side.You didn't marry her, did
you?"He quoted Whitney's impertinences resentfully.He had never endured anything like this
before--he, Lester Kane.Certainly he was
paying dearly for trying to do the kind thing by Jennie.CHAPTER XLI


But worse was to follow.The American public likes gossip about
well-known people, and the Kanes were wealthy and socially prominent.The report was that Lester, one of its principal heirs, had married a
servant girl.What a
piquant morsel for the newspapers!Very soon the paragraphs began to
appear.A small society paper, called the South Side Budget,
referred to him anonymously as "the son of a famous and wealthy
carriage manufacturer of Cincinnati," and outlined briefly what it
knew of the story.----" it went on, sagely, "not
so much is known, except that she once worked in a well-known
Cleveland society family as a maid and was, before that, a
working-girl in Columbus, Ohio.After such a picturesque love-affair
in high society, who shall say that romance is dead?"He did not take the paper, but some kind soul
took good care to see that a copy was marked and mailed to him.It
irritated him greatly, for he suspected at once that it was a scheme
to blackmail him.But he did not know exactly what to do about it.He
preferred, of course, that such comments should cease, but he also
thought that if he made any effort to have them stopped he might make
matters worse.Naturally, the paragraph in the
Budget attracted the attention of other newspapers.It sounded
like a good story, and one Sunday editor, more enterprising than the
others, conceived the notion of having this romance written up.A
full-page Sunday story with a scare-head such as "Sacrifices Millions
for His Servant Girl Love," pictures of Lester, Jennie, the house at
Hyde Park, the Kane manufactory at Cincinnati, the warehouse on
Michigan Avenue--certainly, such a display would make a
sensation.The Kane Company was not an advertiser in any daily or
Sunday paper.If Lester had been
forewarned he might have put a stop to the whole business by putting
an advertisement in the paper or appealing to the publisher.He did
not know, however, and so was without power to prevent the
publication.The editor made a thorough job of the business.Local
newspaper men in Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus were instructed
to report by wire whether anything of Jennie's history was known in
their city.The Bracebridge family in Cleveland was asked whether
Jennie had ever worked there.A garbled history of the Gerhardts was
obtained from Columbus.Jennie's residence on the North Side, for
several years prior to her supposed marriage, was discovered and so
the whole story was nicely pieced together.It was not the idea of the
newspaper editor to be cruel or critical, but rather complimentary.All the bitter things, such as the probable illegitimacy of Vesta, the
suspected immorality of Lester and Jennie in residing together as man
and wife, the real grounds of the well-known objections of his family
to the match, were ignored.The idea was to frame up a Romeo and
Juliet story in which Lester should appear as an ardent,
self-sacrificing lover, and Jennie as a poor and lovely working-girl,
lifted to great financial and social heights by the devotion of her
millionaire lover.An exceptional newspaper artist was engaged to make
scenes depicting the various steps of the romance and the whole thing
was handled in the most approved yellow-journal style.There was a
picture of Lester obtained from his Cincinnati photographer for a
consideration; Jennie had been surreptitiously "snapped" by a staff
artist while she was out walking.And so, apparently out of a clear sky, the story
appeared--highly complimentary, running over with sugary phrases,
but with all the dark, sad facts looming up in the background.Jennie
did not see it at first.Lester came across the page accidentally, and
tore it out.He was stunned and chagrined beyond words."To think the
damned newspaper would do that to a private citizen who was quietly
minding his own business!"He went out of the house, the
better to conceal his deep inward mortification.He avoided the more
populous parts of the town, particularly the down-town section, and
rode far out on Cottage Grove Avenue to the open prairie.He wondered,
as the trolley-car rumbled along, what his friends were
thinking--Dodge, and Burnham Moore, and Henry Aldrich, and the
others.The best he could do was to put a
brave face on it and say nothing, or else wave it off with an
indifferent motion of the hand.One thing was sure--he would
prevent further comment.He returned to the house calmer, his
self-poise restored, but he was eager for Monday to come in order that
he might get in touch with his lawyer, Mr.Watson it was soon agreed between the two men that it would be
foolish to take any legal action.It was the part of wisdom to let the
matter drop."But I won't stand for anything more," concluded
Lester."I'll attend to that," said the lawyer, consolingly."It's amazing--this damned country of ours!""A man with a little money hasn't any more privacy than a
public monument.""A man with a little money," said Mr.Watson, "is just like a cat
with a bell around its neck.Every rat knows exactly where it is and
what it is doing.""That's an apt simile," assented Lester, bitterly.Jennie knew nothing of this newspaper story for several days.Lester felt that he could not talk it over, and Gerhardt never read
the wicked Sunday newspapers.Finally, one of Jennie's neighborhood
friends, less tactful than the others, called her attention to the
fact of its appearance by announcing that she had seen it."Why, I hadn't seen it," she said."Are you
sure it was about us?"I'll send Marie over with it when
I get back."I wish you would," she said, weakly.She was wondering where they had secured her picture, what the
article said.Above all, she was dismayed to think of its effect upon
Lester.Why had he not spoken to her about
it?The neighbor's daughter brought over the paper, and Jennie's heart
stood still as she glanced at the title-page.There it all
was--uncompromising and direct.How dreadfully conspicuous the
headline--"This Millionaire Fell in Love With This Lady's Maid,"
which ran between a picture of Lester on the left and Jennie on the
right.There was an additional caption which explained how Lester, son
of the famous carriage family of Cincinnati, had sacrificed great
social opportunity and distinction to marry his heart's desire.Below
were scattered a number of other pictures--Lester addressing
Jennie in the mansion of Mrs.Bracebridge, Lester standing with her
before an imposing and conventional-looking parson, Lester driving
with her in a handsome victoria, Jennie standing beside the window of
an imposing mansion (the fact that it was a mansion being indicated by
most sumptuous-looking hangings) and gazing out on a very modest
working-man's cottage pictured in the distance.Jennie felt as though
she must die for very shame.She did not so much mind what it meant to
her, but Lester, Lester, how must he feel?Now they
would have another club with which to strike him and her.She tried to
keep calm about it, to exert emotional control, but again the tears
would rise, only this time they were tears of opposition to defeat.She did not want to be hounded this way.Why couldn't the world help her,
instead of seeking to push her down?CHAPTER XLII


The fact that Lester had seen this page was made perfectly clear to
Jennie that evening, for he brought it home himself, having concluded,
after mature deliberation, that he ought to.He had told her once that
there was to be no concealment between them, and this thing, coming so
brutally to disturb their peace, was nevertheless a case in point.He
had decided to tell her not to think anything of it--that it did
not make much difference, though to him it made all the difference in
the world.The effect of this chill history could never be undone.The
wise--and they included all his social world and many who were
not of it--could see just how he had been living.The article
which accompanied the pictures told how he had followed Jennie from
Cleveland to Chicago, how she had been coy and distant and that he had
to court her a long time to win her consent.This was to explain their
living together on the North Side.Lester realized that this was an
asinine attempt to sugar-coat the true story and it made him angry.Still he preferred to have it that way rather than in some more brutal
vein.He took the paper out of his pocket when he arrived at the
house, spreading it on the library table.Jennie, who was close by,
watched him, for she knew what was coming."Here's something that will interest you, Jennie," he said dryly,
pointing to the array of text and pictures."I've already seen it, Lester," she said wearily.Stendahl
showed it to me this afternoon."Rather high-flown description of my attitude, isn't it?I didn't
know I was such an ardent Romeo.""I'm awfully sorry, Lester," said Jennie, reading behind the dry
face of humor the serious import of this affair to him.She had long
since learned that Lester did not express his real feeling, his big
ills in words.He was inclined to jest and make light of the
inevitable, the inexorable.This light comment merely meant "this
matter cannot be helped, so we will make the best of it.""Oh, don't feel badly about it," he went on."It isn't anything
which can be adjusted now.We just
happen to be in the limelight.""I understand," said Jennie, coming over to him."I'm sorry,
though, anyway."Dinner was announced a moment later and the incident
was closed.But Lester could not dismiss the thought that matters were getting
in a bad way.His father had pointed it out to him rather plainly at
the last interview, and now this newspaper notoriety had capped the
climax.He might as well abandon his pretension to intimacy with his
old world.It would have none of him, or at least the more
conservative part of it would not.There were a few bachelors, a few
gay married men, some sophisticated women, single and married, who saw
through it all and liked him just the same, but they did not make
society.He was virtually an outcast, and nothing could save him but
to reform his ways; in other words, he must give up Jennie once and
for all.The thought was painful to
him--objectionable in every way.Jennie was growing in mental
acumen.She was beginning to see things quite as clearly as he did.She was not a cheap, ambitious, climbing creature.She was a big woman
and a good one.It would be a shame to throw her down, and besides she
was good-looking.He was forty-six and she was twenty-nine; and she
looked twenty-four or five.It is an exceptional thing to find beauty,
youth, compatibility, intelligence, your own point of
view--softened and charmingly emotionalized--in another.He
had made his bed, as his father had said.It was only a little while after this disagreeable newspaper
incident that Lester had word that his father was quite ill and
failing; it might be necessary for him to go to Cincinnati at any
moment.Pressure of work was holding him pretty close when the news
came that his father was dead.Lester, of course, was greatly shocked
and grieved, and he returned to Cincinnati in a retrospective and
sorrowful mood.His father had been a great character to him--a
fine and interesting old gentleman entirely aside from his
relationship to him as his son.He remembered him now dandling him
upon his knee as a child, telling him stories of his early life in
Ireland, and of his subsequent commercial struggle when he was a
little older, impressing the maxims of his business career and his
commercial wisdom on him as he grew to manhood.Old Archibald had been
radically honest.It was to him that Lester owed his instincts for
plain speech and direct statement of fact."Never lie," was
Archibald's constant, reiterated statement."Never try to make a thing
look different from what it is to you.It's the breath of
life--truth--it's the basis of real worth, while commercial
success--it will make a notable character of any one who will
stick to it."He admired his father intensely
for his rigid insistence on truth, and now that he was really gone he
felt sorry.He wished he might have been spared to be reconciled to
him.He half fancied that old Archibald would have liked Jennie if he
had known her.He did not imagine that he would ever have had the
opportunity to straighten things out, although he still felt that
Archibald would have liked her.When he reached Cincinnati it was snowing, a windy, blustery snow.The traffic of the city
had a muffled sound.When he stepped down from the train he was met by
Amy, who was glad to see him in spite of all their past differences.Of all the girls she was the most tolerant.Lester put his arms about
her, and kissed her."It seems like old times to see you, Amy," he said, "your coming to
meet me this way.Well,
poor father, his time had to come.Still, he lived to see everything
that he wanted to see.I guess he was pretty well satisfied with the
outcome of his efforts.""Yes," replied Amy, "and since mother died he was very lonely."They rode up to the house in kindly good feeling, chatting of old
times and places.All the members of the immediate family, and the
various relatives, were gathered in the old family mansion.Lester
exchanged the customary condolences with the others, realizing all the
while that his father had lived long enough.He had had a successful
life, and had fallen like a ripe apple from the tree.Lester looked at
him where he lay in the great parlor, in his black coffin, and a
feeling of the old-time affection swept over him.He smiled at the
clean-cut, determined, conscientious face."The old gentleman was a big man all the way through," he said to
Robert, who was present."We won't find a better figure of a man
soon.""We will not," said his brother, solemnly.After the funeral it was decided to read the will at once.Louise's
husband was anxious to return to Buffalo; Lester was compelled to be
in Chicago.A conference of the various members of the family was
called for the second day after the funeral, to be held at the offices
of Messrs.Knight, Keatley & O'Brien, counselors of the late
manufacturer.As Lester rode to the meeting he had the feeling that his father
had not acted in any way prejudicial to his interests.It had not been
so very long since they had had their last conversation; he had been
taking his time to think about things, and his father had given him
time.He always felt that he had stood well with the old gentleman,
except for his alliance with Jennie.His business judgment had been
valuable to the company.Why should there be any discrimination
against him?When they reached the offices of the law firm, Mr.O'Brien, a
short, fussy, albeit comfortable-looking little person, greeted all
the members of the family and the various heirs and assigns with a
hearty handshake.He had been personal counsel to Archibald Kane for
twenty years.He knew his whims and idiosyncrasies, and considered
himself very much in the light of a father confessor.He liked all the
children, Lester especially."Now I believe we are all here," he said, finally, extracting a
pair of large horn reading-glasses from his coat pocket and looking
sagely about.I will
just read the will without any preliminary remarks."He turned to his desk, picked up a paper lying upon it, cleared his
throat, and began.It was a peculiar document, in some respects, for it began with all
the minor bequests; first, small sums to old employees, servants, and
friends.It then took up a few institutional bequests, and finally
came to the immediate family, beginning with the girls.Imogene, as a
faithful and loving daughter was left a sixth of the stock of the
carriage company and a fourth of the remaining properties of the
deceased, which roughly aggregated (the estate--not her share)
about eight hundred thousand dollars.Amy and Louise were provided for
in exactly the same proportion.The grandchildren were given certain
little bonuses for good conduct, when they should come of age.Then it
took up the cases of Robert and Lester."Owing to certain complications which have arisen in the affairs of
my son Lester," it began, "I deem it my duty to make certain
conditions which shall govern the distribution of the remainder of my
property, to wit: One-fourth of the stock of the Kane Manufacturing
Company and one-fourth of the remainder of my various properties,
real, personal, moneys, stocks and bonds, to go to my beloved son
Robert, in recognition of the faithful performance of his duty, and
one-fourth of the stock of the Kane Manufacturing Company and the
remaining fourth of my various properties, real, personal, moneys,
stocks and bonds, to be held in trust by him for the benefit of his
brother Lester, until such time as such conditions as may hereinafter
be set forth shall have been complied with.And it is my wish and
desire that my children shall concur in his direction of the Kane
Manufacturing Company, and of such other interests as are entrusted to
him, until such time as he shall voluntarily relinquish such control,
or shall indicate another arrangement which shall be better."His cheeks changed color, but he did
not move.It appeared that he was
not even mentioned separately.The conditions "hereinafter set forth" dealt very fully with his
case, however, though they were not read aloud to the family at the
time, Mr.O'Brien stating that this was in accordance with their
father's wish.Lester learned immediately afterward that he was to
have ten thousand a year for three years, during which time he had the
choice of doing either one of two things: First, he was to leave
Jennie, if he had not already married her, and so bring his life into
moral conformity with the wishes of his father.In this event Lester's
share of the estate was to be immediately turned over to him.Secondly, he might elect to marry Jennie, if he had not already done
so, in which case the ten thousand a year, specifically set aside to
him for three years, was to be continued for life--but for his
life only.Jennie was not to have anything of it after his death.The
ten thousand in question represented the annual interest on two
hundred shares of L. S. and M. S. stock which were also to be held in
trust until his decision had been reached and their final disposition
effected.If Lester refused to marry Jennie, or to leave her, he was
to have nothing at all after the three years were up.At Lester's
death the stock on which his interest was drawn was to be divided pro
rata among the surviving members of the family.If any heir or assign
contested the will, his or her share was thereby forfeited
entirely.It was astonishing to Lester to see how thoroughly his father had
taken his case into consideration.He half suspected, on reading these
conditions, that his brother Robert had had something to do with the
framing of them, but of course he could not be sure.Robert had not
given any direct evidence of enmity.he demanded of O'Brien, a little later."Well, we all had a hand in it," replied O'Brien, a little
shamefacedly."It was a very difficult document to draw up.Kane, there was no budging your father.He has
come very near defeating his own wishes in some of these clauses.Of
course, you know, we had nothing to do with its spirit.I hated very much to have to do it."During the reading of the will Lester had sat as stolid as an
ox.He got up after a time, as did the others, assuming an air of
nonchalance.Robert, Amy, Louise and Imogene all felt shocked, but not
exactly, not unqualifiedly regretful."I think the old gentleman has been a little rough in this," said
Robert, who had been sitting next him."I certainly did not expect him
to go as far as that.So far as I am concerned some other arrangement
would have been satisfactory."Imogene, Amy, and Louise were anxious to be consolatory, but they
did not know what to say."I
don't think papa acted quite right, Lester," ventured Amy, but Lester
waved her away almost gruffly.He figured out, as he stood there, what his income would be in case
he refused to comply with his father's wishes.Two hundred shares of
L. S. and M. S., in open market, were worth a little over one thousand
each.They yielded from five to six per cent., sometimes more,
sometimes less.At this rate he would have ten thousand a year, not
more.The family gathering broke up, each going his way, and Lester
returned to his sister's house.He wanted to get out of the city
quickly, gave business as an excuse to avoid lunching with any one,
and caught the earliest train back to Chicago.So this was how much his father really cared for him!He, Lester Kane, ten thousand a year, for only three
years, and then longer only on condition that he married Jennie!"Ten
thousand a year," he thought, "and that for three years!To think he should have done that to
me!"CHAPTER XLIII


This attempt at coercion was the one thing which would definitely
set Lester in opposition to his family, at least for the time being.He had realized clearly enough of late that he had made a big mistake;
first in not having married Jennie, thus avoiding scandal; and in the
second place in not having accepted her proposition at the time when
she wanted to leave him; There were no two ways about it, he had made
a mess of this business.He could not afford to lose his fortune
entirely.He did not have enough money of his own.Jennie was unhappy,
he could see that.Did he want
to accept the shabby ten thousand a year, even if he were willing to
marry her?Finally, did he want to lose Jennie, to have her go out of
his life once and for all?He could not make up his mind; the problem
was too complicated.When Lester returned to his home, after the funeral, Jennie saw at
once that something was amiss with him, something beyond a son's
natural grief for his father's death was weighing upon his spirits.She tried to draw near to him
sympathetically, but his wounded spirit could not be healed so easily.When hurt in his pride he was savage and sullen--he could have
struck any man who irritated him.She watched him interestedly,
wishing to do something for him, but he would not give her his
confidence.He grieved, and she could only grieve with him.Days passed, and now the financial situation which had been created
by his father's death came up for careful consideration.The factory
management had to be reorganized.Robert would have to be made
president, as his father wished.Lester's own relationship to the
business would have to come up for adjudication.Unless he changed his
mind about Jennie, he was not a stockholder.As a matter of fact, he
was not anything.To continue to be secretary and treasurer, it was
necessary that he should own at least one share of the company's
stock.Would the other members of the family care to do
anything which would infringe on Robert's prerogatives under the will?They were all rather unfriendly to Lester at present, and he realized
that he was facing a ticklish situation.The solution was--to get
rid of Jennie.If he did that he would not need to be begging for
stock.If he didn't, he was flying in the face of his father's last
will and testament.He turned the matter over in his mind slowly and
deliberately.He could quite see how things were coming out.He must
abandon either Jennie or his prospects in life.Despite Robert's assertion, that so far as he was concerned another
arrangement would have been satisfactory, he was really very well
pleased with the situation; his dreams were slowly nearing completion.Robert had long had his plans perfected, not only for a thorough
reorganization of the company proper, but for an extension of the
business in the direction of a combination of carriage companies.If
he could get two or three of the larger organizations in the East and
West to join with him, selling costs could be reduced, over-production
would be avoided, and the general expenses could be materially scaled
down.Through a New York representative, he had been picking up stock
in outside carriage companies for some time and he was almost ready to
act.In the first place he would have himself elected president of the
Kane Company, and since Lester was no longer a factor, he could select
Amy's husband as vice-president, and possibly some one other than
Lester as secretary and treasurer.Under the conditions of the will,
the stock and other properties set aside temporarily for Lester, in
the hope that he would come to his senses, were to be managed and
voted by Robert.His father had meant, obviously, that he, Robert,
should help him coerce his brother.He did not want to appear mean,
but this was such an easy way.It gave him a righteous duty to
perform.Lester must come to his senses or he must let Robert run the
business to suit himself.Lester, attending to his branch duties in Chicago, foresaw the
drift of things.He realized now that he was permanently out of the
company, a branch manager at his brother's sufferance, and the thought
irritated him greatly.Nothing had been said by Robert to indicate
that such a change had taken place--things went on very much as
before--but Robert's suggestions were now obviously law.Lester
was really his brother's employee at so much a year.There came a time, after a few weeks, when he felt as if he could
not stand this any longer.Hitherto he had been a free and independent
agent.The approaching annual stockholder's meeting which hitherto had
been a one-man affair and a formality, his father doing all the
voting, would be now a combination of voters, his brother presiding,
his sisters very likely represented by their husbands, and he not
there at all.It was going to be a great come-down, but as Robert had
not said anything about offering to give or sell him any stock which
would entitle him to sit as a director or hold any official position
in the company, he decided to write and resign.That would bring
matters to a crisis.It would show his brother that he felt no desire
to be under obligations to him in any way or to retain anything which
was not his--and gladly so--by right of ability and the
desire of those with whom he was associated.If he wanted to move back
into the company by deserting Jennie he would come in a very different
capacity from that of branch manager.He dictated a simple,
straight-forward business letter, saying:

"DEAR ROBERT, I know the time is drawing near when the company
must be reorganized under your direction.Not having any stock, I am
not entitled to sit as a director, or to hold the joint position of
secretary and treasurer.I want you to accept this letter as formal
notice of my resignation from both positions, and I want to have your
directors consider what disposition should be made of this position
and my services.I am not anxious to retain the branch-managership as
a branch-managership merely; at the same time I do not want to do
anything which will embarrass you in your plans for the future.You
see by this that I am not ready to accept the proposition laid down in
father's will--at least, not at present.I would like a definite
understanding of how you feel in this matter."Yours,

"LESTER."Robert, sitting in his office at Cincinnati, considered this letter
gravely.It was like his brother to come down to "brass tacks."If
Lester were only as cautious as he was straightforward and direct,
what a man he would be!But there was no guile in the man--no
subtlety.He would never do a snaky thing--and Robert knew, in
his own soul, that to succeed greatly one must."You have to be
ruthless at times--you have to be subtle," Robert would say to
himself."Why not face the facts to yourself when you are playing for
big stakes?"He would, for one, and he did.Robert felt that although Lester was a tremendously decent fellow
and his brother, he wasn't pliable enough to suit his needs.He was
too outspoken, too inclined to take issue.If Lester yielded to his
father's wishes, and took possession of his share of the estate, he
would become, necessarily, an active partner in the affairs of the
company.Lester would be a barrier in Robert's path.He much preferred that Lester should hold
fast to Jennie, for the present at least, and so be quietly shelved by
his own act.After long consideration, Robert dictated a politic letter.He
hadn't made up his mind yet just what he wanted to do.He did not know
what his sisters' husbands would like.For his part, he would be very glad to have Lester remain as
secretary and treasurer, if it could be arranged.Perhaps it would be
better to let the matter rest for the present.What did Robert mean by beating around the bush?He
knew well enough how it could be arranged.One share of stock would be
enough for Lester to qualify.Robert was afraid of him--that was
the basic fact.Well, he would not retain any branch-managership,
depend on that.Lester accordingly wrote
back, saying that he had considered all sides, and had decided to look
after some interests of his own, for the time being.If Robert could
arrange it, he would like to have some one come on to Chicago and take
over the branch agency.In a few
days came a regretful reply, saying that Robert was awfully sorry, but
that if Lester was determined he did not want to interfere with any
plans he might have in view.Imogene's husband, Jefferson Midgely, had
long thought he would like to reside in Chicago.He could undertake
the work for the time being.Evidently Robert was making the best of a very
subtle situation.Robert knew that he, Lester, could sue and tie
things up, and also that he would be very loath to do so.The
newspapers would get hold of the whole story.This matter of his
relationship to Jennie was in the air, anyhow.He could best solve the
problem by leaving her.CHAPTER XLIV


For a man of Lester's years--he was now forty-six--to be
tossed out in the world without a definite connection, even though he
did have a present income (including this new ten thousand) of fifteen
thousand a year, was a disturbing and discouraging thing.He realized
now that, unless he made some very fortunate and profitable
arrangements in the near future, his career was virtually at an end.That would give him the ten thousand
for the rest of his life, but it would also end his chance of getting
his legitimate share of the Kane estate.Again, he might sell out the
seventy-five thousand dollars' worth of moderate interest-bearing
stocks, which now yielded him about five thousand, and try a practical
investment of some kind--say a rival carriage company.But did he
want to jump in, at this stage of the game, and begin a running fight
on his father's old organization?Moreover, it would be a hard row to
hoe.There was the keenest rivalry for business as it was, with the
Kane Company very much in the lead.Lester's only available capital
was his seventy-five thousand dollars.Did he want to begin in a
picayune, obscure way?It took money to get a foothold in the carriage
business as things were now.The trouble with Lester was that, while blessed with a fine
imagination and considerable insight, he lacked the ruthless,
narrow-minded insistence on his individual superiority which is a
necessary element in almost every great business success.To be a
forceful figure in the business world means, as a rule, that you must
be an individual of one idea, and that idea the God-given one that
life has destined you for a tremendous future in the particular field
you have chosen.It means that one thing, a cake of soap, a new
can-opener, a safety razor, or speed-accelerator, must seize on your
imagination with tremendous force, burn as a raging flame, and make
itself the be-all and end-all of your existence.As a rule, a man
needs poverty to help him to this enthusiasm, and youth.The thing he
has discovered, and with which he is going to busy himself, must be
the door to a thousand opportunities and a thousand joys.Happiness
must be beyond or the fire will not burn as brightly as it
might--the urge will not be great enough to make a great
success.Lester did not possess this indispensable quality of enthusiasm.Life had already shown him the greater part of its so-called joys.He
saw through the illusions that are so often and so noisily labeled
pleasure.Money, of course, was essential, and he had already had
money--enough to keep him comfortably.Certainly he could not
comfortably contemplate the thought of sitting by and watching other
people work for the rest of his days.In the end he decided that he would bestir himself and look into
things.He was, as he said to himself, in no hurry; he was not going
to make a mistake.He would first give the trade, the people who were
identified with v he manufacture and sale of carriages, time to
realize that he was out of the Kane Company, for the time being,
anyhow, and open to other connections.So he announced that he was
leaving the Kane Company and going to Europe, ostensibly for a rest.He had never been abroad, and Jennie, too, would enjoy it.Vesta could
be left at home with Gerhardt and a maid, and he and Jennie would
travel around a bit, seeing what Europe had to show.He wanted to
visit Venice and Baden-Baden, and the great watering-places that had
been recommended to him.Cairo and Luxor and the Parthenon had always
appealed to his imagination.After he had had his outing he could come
back and seriously gather up the threads of his intentions.The spring after his father died, he put his plan into execution.He had wound up the work of the warerooms and with a pleasant
deliberation had studied out a tour.He made Jennie his confidante,
and now, having gathered together their traveling comforts they took a
steamer from New York to Liverpool.After a few weeks in the British
Isles they went to Egypt.From there they came back, through Greece
and Italy, into Austria and Switzerland, and then later, through
France and Paris, to Germany and Berlin.Lester was diverted by the
novelty of the experience and yet he had an uncomfortable feeling that
he was wasting his time.Great business enterprises were not built by
travelers, and he was not looking for health.Jennie, on the other hand, was transported by what she saw, and
enjoyed the new life to the full.Before Luxor and Karnak--places
which Jennie had never dreamed existed--she learned of an older
civilization, powerful, complex, complete.Millions of people had
lived and died here, believing in other gods, other forms of
government, other conditions of existence.For the first time in her
life Jennie gained a clear idea of how vast the world is.Now from
this point of view--of decayed Greece, of fallen Rome, of
forgotten Egypt, she saw how pointless are our minor difficulties, our
minor beliefs.Her father's Lutheranism--it did not seem so
significant any more; and the social economy of Columbus,
Ohio--rather pointless, perhaps.Her mother had worried so of
what people--her neighbors--thought, but here were dead
worlds of people, some bad, some good.Lester explained that their
differences in standards of morals were due sometimes to climate,
sometimes to religious beliefs, and sometimes to the rise of peculiar
personalities like Mohammed.Lester liked to point out how small
conventions bulked in this, the larger world, and vaguely she began to
see.Admitting that she had been bad--locally it was important,
perhaps, but in the sum of civilization, in the sum of big forces,
what did it all amount to?They would be dead after a little while,
she and Lester and all these people.Did anything matter except
goodness--goodness of heart?CHAPTER XLV


It was while traveling abroad that Lester came across, first at the
Carlton in London and later at Shepheards in Cairo, the one girl,
before Jennie, whom it might have been said he truly
admired--Letty Pace.He had not seen her for a long time, and she
had been Mrs.Malcolm Gerald for nearly four years, and a charming
widow for nearly two years more.Malcolm Gerald had been a wealthy
man, having amassed a fortune in banking and stock-brokering in
Cincinnati, and he had left Mrs.She was
the mother of one child, a little girl, who was safely in charge of a
nurse and maid at all times, and she was invariably the picturesque
center of a group of admirers recruited from every capital of the
civilized world.Letty Gerald was a talented woman, beautiful,
graceful, artistic, a writer of verse, an omnivorous reader, a student
of art, and a sincere and ardent admirer of Lester Kane.In her day she had truly loved him, for she had been a wise
observer of men and affairs, and Lester had always appealed to her as
a real man.He was so sane, she thought, so calm.He was always
intolerant of sham, and she liked him for it.He was inclined to wave
aside the petty little frivolities of common society conversation, and
to talk of simple and homely things.Many and many a time, in years
past, they had deserted a dance to sit out on a balcony somewhere, and
talk while Lester smoked.He had argued philosophy with her, discussed
books, described political and social conditions in other
cities--in a word, he had treated her like a sensible human
being, and she had hoped and hoped and hoped that he would propose to
her.More than once she had looked at his big, solid head with its
short growth of hardy brown hair, and wished that she could stroke it.It was a hard blow to her when he finally moved away to Chicago; at
that time she knew nothing of Jennie, but she felt instinctively that
her chance of winning him was gone.Then Malcolm Gerald, always an ardent admirer, proposed for
something like the sixty-fifth time, and she took him.She did not
love him, but she was getting along, and she had to marry some one.He
was forty-four when he married her, and he lived only four
years--just long enough to realize that he had married a
charming, tolerant, broad-minded woman.Gerald was a rich widow, sympathetic, attractive, delightful in
her knowledge of the world, and with nothing to do except to live and
to spend her money.She was not inclined to do either indifferently.She had long since
had her ideal of a man established by Lester.These whipper-snappers
of counts, earls, lords, barons, whom she met in one social world and
another (for her friendship and connections had broadened notably with
the years), did not interest her a particle.She was terribly weary of
the superficial veneer of the titled fortune-hunter whom she met
abroad.A good judge of character, a student of men and manners, a
natural reasoner along sociologic and psychologic lines, she saw
through them and through the civilization which they represented."I
could have been happy in a cottage with a man I once knew out in
Cincinnati," she told one of her titled women friends who had been an
American before her marriage."He was the biggest, cleanest, sanest
fellow.If he had proposed to me I would have married him if I had had
to work for a living myself."He was comfortably rich, but that did not make
any difference to me."It would have made a difference in the long run," said the
other."You misjudge me," replied Mrs."I waited for him for a
number of years, and I know."Lester had always retained pleasant impressions and kindly memories
of Letty Pace, or Mrs.He had been fond of her
in a way, very fond.He had asked himself
that question time and again.She would have made him an ideal wife,
his father would have been pleased, everybody would have been
delighted.Instead he had drifted and drifted, and then he had met
Jennie; and somehow, after that, he did not want her any more.Now
after six years of separation he met her again.She was vaguely aware he had had some sort of an
affair--she had heard that he had subsequently married the woman
and was living on the South Side.She did not know of the loss of his
fortune.She ran across him first in the Carlton one June evening.The
windows were open, and the flowers were blooming everywhere, odorous
with that sense of new life in the air which runs through the world
when spring comes back.For the moment she was a little beside
herself.Something choked in her throat; but she collected herself and
extended a graceful arm and hand.It seems truly like a breath
of spring to see you again.Kane, but
I'm delighted to see your husband.I'm ashamed to say how many years
it is, Lester, since I saw you last!I feel quite old when I think of
it.Why, Lester, think; it's been all of six or seven years!And I've
been married and had a child, and poor Mr.Gerald has died, and oh,
dear, I don't know what all hasn't happened to me.""You don't look it," commented Lester, smiling.He was pleased to
see her again, for they had been good friends.She liked him
still--that was evident, and he truly liked her.She was glad to see this old friend of Lester's.This woman, trailing a magnificent yellow lace train over pale,
mother-of-pearl satin, her round, smooth arms bare to the shoulder,
her corsage cut low and a dark red rose blowing at her waist, seemed
to her the ideal of what a woman should be.She liked looking at
lovely women quite as much as Lester; she enjoyed calling his
attention to them, and teasing him, in the mildest way, about their
charms."Wouldn't you like to run and talk to her, Lester, instead of
to me?"she would ask when some particularly striking or beautiful
woman chanced to attract her attention.Lester would examine her
choice critically, for he had come to know that her judge of feminine
charms was excellent."Oh, I'm pretty well off where I am," he would
retort, looking into her eyes; or, jestingly, "I'm not as young as I
used to be, or I'd get in tow of that.""What would you do if I really should?""Why, Lester, I wouldn't do anything.You'd come back to me,
maybe."But if you felt that you wanted to, I wouldn't
try to stop you.I wouldn't expect to be all in all to one man, unless
he wanted me to be.""Where do you get those ideas, Jennie?"he asked her once, curious
to test the breadth of her philosophy."Oh, I don't know, why?""They're so broad, so good-natured, so charitable.They're not
common, that's sure.""Why, I don't think we ought to be selfish, Lester.Some women think differently, I know, but a man and a woman ought
to want to live together, or they ought not to--don't you think?It doesn't make so much difference if a man goes off for a little
while--just so long as he doesn't stay--if he wants to come
back at all."Lester smiled, but he respected her for the sweetness of her point
of view--he had to.To-night, when she saw this woman so eager to talk to Lester, she
realized at once that they must have a great deal in common to talk
over; whereupon she did a characteristic thing."Won't you excuse me
for a little while?""I left some things uncared
for in our rooms.She went away, remaining in her room as long as she reasonably
could, and Lester and Letty fell to discussing old times in earnest.He recounted as much of his experiences as he deemed wise, and Letty
brought the history of her life up to date."Now that you're safely
married, Lester," she said daringly, "I'll confess to you that you
were the one man I always wanted to have propose to me--and you
never did.""Maybe I never dared," he said, gazing into her superb black eyes,
and thinking that perhaps she might know that he was not married.He
felt that she had grown more beautiful in every way.She seemed to him
now to be an ideal society figure-perfection itself--gracious,
natural, witty, the type of woman who mixes and mingles well, meeting
each new-comer upon the plane best suited to him or her."Anyhow, I allow you some credit."Jennie has her good points," he replied simply.Yes, I suppose I'm happy--as happy as any one
can be who sees life as it is.You know I'm not troubled with many
illusions.""Not any, I think, kind sir, if I know you.""Very likely, not any, Letty; but sometimes I wish I had a few.Really, I look on my life as a kind of
failure, you know, in spite of the fact that I'm almost as rich as
Croesus--not quite.I think he had some more than I have.""What talk from you--you, with your beauty and talent, and
money--good heavens!"Travel, talk, shoo away silly
fortune-hunters.Oh, dear, sometimes I get so tired!"In spite of Jennie, the old feeling came
back.They were as
comfortable together as old married people, or young lovers.She looked at him, and her eyes fairly spoke."We'll have to brace up and talk of
other things."Yes, I know," she replied, and turned on Jennie a radiant
smile.Jennie felt a faint sense of misgiving.She thought vaguely that
this might be one of Lester's old flames.This was the kind of woman
he should have chosen--not her.She was suited to his station in
life, and he would have been as happy--perhaps happier.Then she put away the uncomfortable thought;
pretty soon she would be getting jealous, and that would be
contemptible.Gerald continued to be most agreeable in her attitude toward
the Kanes.She invited them the next day to join her on a drive
through Rotten Row.There was a dinner later at Claridge's, and then
she was compelled to keep some engagement which was taking her to
Paris.She bade them both an affectionate farewell, and hoped that
they would soon meet again.She was envious, in a sad way, of Jennie's
good fortune.Lester had lost none of his charm for her.If anything,
he seemed nicer, more considerate, more wholesome.She wished
sincerely that he were free.And Lester--subconsciously
perhaps--was thinking the same thing.No doubt because of the fact that she was thinking of it, he had
been led over mentally all of the things which might have happened if
he had married her.They were so congenial now, philosophically,
artistically, practically.There was a natural flow of conversation
between them all the time, like two old comrades among men.She knew
everybody in his social sphere, which was equally hers, but Jennie did
not.They could talk of certain subtle characteristics of life in a
way which was not possible between him and Jennie, for the latter did
not have the vocabulary.Her ideas did not flow as fast as those of
Mrs.Jennie had actually the deeper, more comprehensive,
sympathetic, and emotional note in her nature, but she could not show
it in light conversation.Actually she was living the thing she was,
and that was perhaps the thing which drew Lester to her.Just now, and
often in situations of this kind, she seemed at a disadvantage, and
she was.It seemed to Lester for the time being as if Mrs.Gerald
would perhaps have been a better choice after all--certainly as
good, and he would not now have this distressing thought as to his
future.In the
gardens about the hotel they suddenly encountered her, or rather
Lester did, for he was alone at the time, strolling and smoking."Well, this is good luck," he exclaimed.I didn't know I was coming until last
Thursday.You know I
wondered where you might be.Then I remembered that you said you were
going to Egypt."In her bath, I fancy, at this moment.This warm weather makes
Jennie take to water.Letty was in light blue silk, with
a blue and white parasol held daintily over her shoulder, and looked
very pretty.she suddenly ejaculated, "I wonder sometimes
what I am to do with myself.I think
I'll go back to the States to live."I haven't
any one to marry now--that I want."She glanced at Lester
significantly, then looked away."Oh, you'll find some one eventually," he said, somewhat awkwardly."You can't escape for long--not with your looks and money."she inquired lightly, thinking of a ball
which was to be given at the hotel that evening.He had danced so well
a few years before."Now, Lester, you don't mean to say that you have gone and
abandoned that last charming art.Come to
think of it, I suppose that is my fault.I haven't thought of dancing
in some time."It occurred to him that he hadn't been going to functions of any
kind much for some time.The opposition his entanglement had generated
had put a stop to that."Come and dance with me to-night."I'll have to think about that," replied Lester.Dancing will probably go hard with me at my time of
life.""Oh, hush, Lester," replied Mrs.Mercy alive, you'd think you were an old
man!""Pshaw, that simply makes us more attractive," replied his old
flame.CHAPTER XLVI


That night after dinner the music was already sounding in the
ball-room of the great hotel adjacent to the palm-gardens when Mrs.Gerald found Lester smoking on one of the verandas with Jennie by his
side.The latter was in white satin and white slippers, her hair lying
a heavy, enticing mass about her forehead and ears.Lester was
brooding over the history of Egypt, its successive tides or waves of
rather weak-bodied people; the thin, narrow strip of soil along either
side of the Nile that had given these successive waves of population
sustenance; the wonder of heat and tropic life, and this hotel with
its modern conveniences and fashionable crowd set down among ancient,
soul-weary, almost despairing conditions.He and Jennie had looked
this morning on the pyramids.They had taken a trolley to the Sphinx!They had watched swarms of ragged, half-clad, curiously costumed men
and boys moving through narrow, smelly, albeit brightly colored, lanes
and alleys."It all seems such a mess to me," Jennie had said at one place.I like it, but somehow they seem tangled
up, like a lot of worms."Lester chuckled, "You're almost right.Life is always mushy and sensual under these conditions.To-night he was brooding over this, the moon shining down into the
grounds with an exuberant, sensuous luster."Well, at last I've found you!""I couldn't
get down to dinner, after all.I've made your husband agree to dance with me, Mrs.Kane," she went on
smilingly.She, like Lester and Jennie, was under the sensuous
influence of the warmth, the spring, the moonlight.There were rich
odors abroad, floating subtly from groves and gardens; from the remote
distance camel-bells were sounding and exotic cries, "Ayah!"as though a drove of strange animals were
being rounded up and driven through the crowded streets."You're welcome to him," replied Jennie pleasantly."You ought to take lessons right away then," replied Lester
genially."I'll do my best to keep you company.I'm not as light on my
feet as I was once, but I guess I can get around.""Oh, I don't want to dance that badly," smiled Jennie."But you two
go on, I'm going up-stairs in a little while, anyway.""Why don't you come sit in the ball-room?I can't do more than a
few rounds.Then we can watch the others," said Lester rising.Gerald in dark wine-colored silk, covered with
glistening black beads, her shapely arms and neck bare, and a flashing
diamond of great size set just above her forehead in her dark hair.Her lips were red, and she had an engaging smile, showing an even row
of white teeth between wide, full, friendly lips.Lester's strong,
vigorous figure was well set off by his evening clothes, he looked
distinguished."That is the woman he should have married," said Jennie to herself
as he disappeared.She fell into a reverie, going over the steps of
her past life.Sometimes it seemed to her now as if she had been
living in a dream.At other times she felt as though she were in that
dream yet.Life sounded in her ears much as this night did.But back of it were
subtleties that shaded and changed one into the other like the
shifting of dreams.Why had
Lester been so eager to follow her?She
thought of her life in Columbus, when she carried coal; to-night she
was in Egypt, at this great hotel, the chatelaine of a suite of rooms,
surrounded by every luxury, Lester still devoted to her.He had
endured so many things for her!Still she felt humble, out of place,
holding handfuls of jewels that did not belong to her.Again she
experienced that peculiar feeling which had come over her the first
time she went to New York with Lester--namely, that this fairy
existence could not endure.She would go back to simple things, to a side street, a poor
cottage, to old clothes.And then as she thought of her home in Chicago, and the attitude of
his friends, she knew it must be so.She would never be received, even
if he married her.She could look into
the charming, smiling face of this woman who was now with Lester, and
see that she considered her very nice, perhaps, but not of Lester's
class.She was saying to herself now no doubt as she danced with
Lester that he needed some one like her.He needed some one who had
been raised in the atmosphere of the things to which he had been
accustomed.He couldn't very well expect to find in her, Jennie, the
familiarity with, the appreciation of the niceties to, which he had
always been accustomed.Her mind had
awakened rapidly to details of furniture, clothing, arrangement,
decorations, manner, forms, customs, but--she was not to the
manner born.If she went away Lester would return to his old world, the world of
the attractive, well-bred, clever woman who now hung upon his arm.The
tears came into Jennie's eyes; she wished, for the moment, that she
might die.Gerald, or sitting out between the waltzes talking over old
times, old places, and old friends.As he looked at Letty he marveled
at her youth and beauty.She was more developed than formerly, but
still as slender and shapely as Diana.She had strength, too, in this
smooth body of hers, and her black eyes were liquid and lusterful."I swear, Letty," he said impulsively, "you're really more
beautiful than ever."You know I do, or I wouldn't say so."Oh, Lester, you bear, can't you allow a woman just a little
coyness?Don't you know we all love to sip our praise, and not be
compelled to swallow it in one great mouthful?"You're such a big, determined,
straightforward boy.They strolled into the garden as the music ceased, and he squeezed
her arm softly.He couldn't help it; she made him feel as if he owned
her.She said to herself, as they sat
looking at the lanterns in the gardens, that if ever he were free, and
would come to her, she would take him.She was almost ready to take
him anyhow--only he probably wouldn't.He was so straight-laced,
so considerate.He wouldn't, like so many other men she knew, do a
mean thing.He
and Jennie were going farther up the Nile in the morning--toward
Karnak and Thebes and the water-washed temples at Phylae.They
would have to start at an unearthly early hour, and he must get to
bed."Yes; we sail from Hamburg on the ninth--the
Fulda.""I may be going back in the fall," laughed Letty."Don't be
surprised if I crowd in on the same boat with you.I'm very unsettled
in my mind.""Come along, for goodness sake," replied Lester."I hope you do....
I'll see you to-morrow before we leave."He paused, and she looked at
him wistfully."Cheer up," he said, taking her hand."You never can tell what life
will do.We sometimes find ourselves right when we thought we were all
wrong."He was thinking that she was sorry to lose him, and he was sorry
that she was not in a position to have what she wanted.As for
himself, he was saying that here was one solution that probably he
would never accept; yet it was a solution.Why had he not seen this
years before?"And yet she wasn't as beautiful then as she is now, nor as wise,
nor as wealthy."But he couldn't be unfaithful to Jennie
nor wish her any bad luck.She had had enough without his willing, and
had borne it bravely.CHAPTER XLVII


The trip home did bring another week with Mrs.Gerald, for after
mature consideration she had decided to venture to America for a
while.Chicago and Cincinnati were her destinations, and she hoped to
see more of Lester.Her presence was a good deal of a surprise to
Jennie, and it started her thinking again.Gerald would marry Lester;
that was certain.As it was--well, the question was a complicated
one.Letty was Lester's natural mate, so far as birth, breeding, and
position went.And yet Jennie felt instinctively that, on the large
human side, Lester preferred her.Perhaps time would solve the
problem; in the mean time the little party of three continued to
remain excellent friends.Gerald went
her way, and Jennie and Lester took up the customary thread of their
existence.On his return from Europe Lester set to work in earnest to find a
business opening.None of the big companies made him any overtures,
principally because he was considered a strong man who was looking for
a control in anything he touched.The nature of his altered fortunes
had not been made public.All the little companies that he
investigated were having a hand-to-mouth existence, or manufacturing a
product which was not satisfactory to him.He did find one company in
a small town in northern Indiana which looked as though it might have
a future.It was controlled by a practical builder of wagons and
carriages--such as Lester's father had been in his day--who,
however, was not a good business man.He was making some small money
on an investment of fifteen thousand dollars and a plant worth, say,
twenty-five thousand.Lester felt that something could be done here if
proper methods were pursued and business acumen exercised.There would never be a great fortune in it.He was thinking of making an offer to the small manufacturer
when the first rumors of a carriage trust reached him.Robert had gone ahead rapidly with his scheme for reorganizing the
carriage trade.He showed his competitors how much greater profits
could be made through consolidation than through a mutually
destructive rivalry.So convincing were his arguments that one by one
the big carriage manufacturing companies fell into line.Within a few
months the deal had been pushed through, and Robert found himself
president of the United Carriage and Wagon Manufacturers' Association,
with a capital stock of ten million dollars, and with assets
aggregating nearly three-fourths of that sum at a forced sale.While all this was going forward Lester was completely in the dark.His trip to Europe prevented him from seeing three or four minor
notices in the newspapers of some of the efforts that were being made
to unite the various carriage and wagon manufactories.He returned to
Chicago to learn that Jefferson Midgely, Imogene's husband, was still
in full charge of the branch and living in Evanston, but because of
his quarrel with his family he was in no position to get the news
direct.Accident brought it fast enough, however, and that rather
irritatingly.The individual who conveyed this information was none other than
Mr.Henry Bracebridge, of Cleveland, into whom he ran at the Union
Club one evening after he had been in the city a month."I hear you're out of the old company," Bracebridge remarked,
smiling blandly."Yes," said Lester, "I'm out.""Oh, I have a deal of my own under consideration, I'm thinking
something of handling an independent concern.""Surely you won't run counter to your brother?He has a pretty good
thing in that combination of his."I hadn't heard of it," said Lester."I've just got
back from Europe.""Well, you want to wake up, Lester," replied Bracebridge."He's got
the biggest thing in your line.The
Lyman-Winthrop Company, the Myer-Brooks Company, the Woods
Company--in fact, five or six of the big companies are all in.Your brother was elected president of the new concern.I dare say he
cleaned up a couple of millions out of the deal."Bracebridge could see that he had given him a vital stab."Well, so long, old man," he exclaimed."When you're in Cleveland
look us up.You know how fond my wife is of you."He strolled away to the smoking-room, but the news took all the
zest out of his private venture.Where would he be with a shabby
little wagon company and his brother president of a carriage trust?Robert could put him out of business in a year.Why, he
himself had dreamed of such a combination as this.It is one thing to have youth, courage, and a fighting spirit to
meet the blows with which fortune often afflicts the talented.It is
quite another to see middle age coming on, your principal fortune
possibly gone, and avenue after avenue of opportunity being sealed to
you on various sides.Jennie's obvious social insufficiency, the
quality of newspaper reputation which had now become attached to her,
his father's opposition and death, the loss of his fortune, the loss
of his connection with the company, his brother's attitude, this
trust, all combined in a way to dishearten and discourage him.He
tried to keep a brave face--and he had succeeded thus far, he
thought, admirably, but this last blow appeared for the time being a
little too much.He went home, the same evening that he heard the
news, sorely disheartened.She realized it, as a matter
of fact, all during the evening that he was away.She felt blue and
despondent herself.When he came home she saw what it
was--something had happened to him.Her first impulse was to say,
"What is the matter, Lester?"but her next and sounder one was to
ignore it until he was ready to speak, if ever.She tried not to let
him see that she saw, coming as near as she might affectionately
without disturbing him."Vesta is so delighted with herself to-day," she volunteered by way
of diversion."That's good," he replied solemnly.She showed me some of her
new dances to-night.You haven't any idea how sweet she looks.""I'm glad of it," he grumbled."I always wanted her to be perfect
in that.It's time she was going into some good girls' school, I
think.""And papa gets in such a rage.She teases him
about it--the little imp.She offered to teach him to dance
to-night.If he didn't love her so he'd box her ears.""I can see that," said Lester, smiling."She's not the least bit disturbed by his storming, either."He was very fond of Vesta, who was now
quite a girl.So Jennie tripped on until his mood was modified a little, and then
some inkling of what had happened came out.It was when they were
retiring for the night."Robert's formulated a pretty big thing in a
financial way since we've been away," he volunteered."Oh, he's gotten up a carriage trust.It's something which will
take in every manufactory of any importance in the country.Bracebridge was telling me that Robert was made president, and that
they have nearly eight millions in capital.""Well, then you won't want to do
much with your new company, will you?""No; there's nothing in that, just now," he said."Later on I fancy
it may be all right.I'll wait and see how this thing comes out.You
never can tell what a trust like that will do."She wished sincerely that she might do
something to comfort him, but she knew that her efforts were useless."Oh, well," she said, "there are so many interesting things in this
world.If I were you I wouldn't be in a hurry to do anything, Lester.She didn't trust herself to say anything more, and he felt that it
was useless to worry.After all, he had an ample income
that was absolutely secure for two years yet.He could have more if he
wanted it.Only his brother was moving so dazzlingly onward, while he
was standing still--perhaps "drifting" would be the better word.It did seem a pity; worst of all, he was beginning to feel a little
uncertain of himself.CHAPTER XLVIII


Lester had been doing some pretty hard thinking, but so far he had
been unable to formulate any feasible plan for his re-entrance into
active life.The successful organization of Robert's carriage trade
trust had knocked in the head any further thought on his part of
taking an interest in the small Indiana wagon manufactory.He could
not be expected to sink his sense of pride and place, and enter a
petty campaign for business success with a man who was so obviously
his financial superior.He had looked up the details of the
combination, and he found that Bracebridge had barely indicated how
wonderfully complete it was.It
would have every little manufacturer by the throat.Should he begin
now in a small way and "pike along" in the shadow of his giant
brother?He would be
running around the country trying to fight a new trust, with his own
brother as his tolerant rival and his own rightful capital arrayed
against him.If not--well, he had his
independent income and the right to come back into the Kane Company if
he wished.It was while Lester was in this mood, drifting, that he received a
visit from Samuel E. Ross, a real estate dealer, whose great, wooden
signs might be seen everywhere on the windy stretches of prairie about
the city.Lester had seen Ross once or twice at the Union Club, where
he had been pointed out as a daring and successful real estate
speculator, and he had noticed his rather conspicuous offices at La
Salle and Washington streets.Ross was a magnetic-looking person of
about fifty years of age, tall, black-bearded, black-eyed, an arched,
wide-nostriled nose, and hair that curled naturally, almost
electrically.Lester was impressed with his lithe, cat-like figure,
and his long, thin, impressive white hands.Ross had a real estate proposition to lay before Mr.Ross admitted fully that he
knew all about Mr.Norman
Yale, of the wholesale grocery firm of Yale, Simpson & Rice, he
had developed "Yalewood."Only within six weeks the last lots in the Ridgewood section of
"Yalewood" had been closed out at a total profit of forty-two per
cent.He went over a list of other deals in real estate which he had
put through, all well-known properties.He admitted frankly that there
were failures in the business; he had had one or two himself.But the
successes far outnumbered the bad speculations, as every one knew.Now
Lester was no longer connected with the Kane Company.He was probably
looking for a good investment, and Mr.Ross had a proposition to lay
before him.Lester consented to listen, and Mr.Ross blinked his
cat-like eyes and started in.The idea was that he and Lester should enter into a one-deal
partnership, covering the purchase and development of a forty-acre
tract of land lying between Fifty-fifth, Seventy-first, Halstead
streets, and Ashland Avenue, on the southwest side.There were
indications of a genuine real estate boom there--healthy,
natural, and permanent.The city was about to pave Fifty-fifth Street.There was a plan to extend the Halstead Street car line far below its
present terminus.The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, which ran near
there, would be glad to put a passenger station on the property.The
initial cost of the land would be forty thousand dollars which they
would share equally.Grading, paving, lighting, tree planting,
surveying would cost, roughly, an additional twenty-five thousand.There would be expenses for advertising--say ten per cent, of the
total investment for two years, or perhaps three--a total of
nineteen thousand five hundred or twenty thousand dollars.All told,
they would stand to invest jointly the sum of ninety-five thousand, or
possibly one hundred thousand dollars, of which Lester's share would
be fifty thousand.The character of the land, its salability, and the likelihood of a
rise in value could be judged by the property adjacent, the sales that
had been made north of Fifty-fifth Street and east of Halstead.Take,
for instance, the Mortimer plot, at Halstead and Fifty-fifth streets,
on the south-east corner.Here was a piece of land that in 1882 was
held at forty-five dollars an acre.In 1886 it had risen to five
hundred dollars an acre, as attested by its sale to a Mr.John L.
Slosson at that time.In 1889, three years later, it had been sold to
Mr.Mortimer for one thousand per acre, precisely the figure at which
this tract was now offered.It could be parceled out into lots fifty
by one hundred feet at five hundred dollars per lot.Ross went on, somewhat boastfully, to explain just how real estate
profits were made.It was useless for any outsider to rush into the
game, and imagine that he could do in a few weeks or years what
trained real estate speculators like himself had been working on for a
quarter of a century.There was something in prestige, something in
taste, something in psychic apprehension.Supposing that they went
into the deal, he, Ross, would be the presiding genius.He had a
trained staff, he controlled giant contractors, he had friends in the
tax office, in the water office, and in the various other city
departments which made or marred city improvements.If Lester would
come in with him he would make him some money--how much he would
not say exactly--fifty thousand dollars at the lowest--one
hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand in all likelihood.Would
Lester let him go into details, and explain just how the scheme could
be worked out?After a few days of quiet cogitation, Lester decided to
accede to Mr.Ross's request; he would look into this thing.CHAPTER XLIX


The peculiarity of this particular proposition was that it had the
basic elements of success.Ross had the experience and the
judgment which were quite capable of making a success of almost
anything he undertook.He was in a field which was entirely familiar.He could convince almost any able man if he could get his ear
sufficiently long to lay his facts before him.Lester was not convinced at first, although, generally speaking, he
was interested in real estate propositions.He
considered it a sound investment providing you did not get too much of
it.He had never invested in any, or scarcely any, solely because he
had not been in a realm where real estate propositions were talked of.As it was he was landless and, in a way, jobless.It was easy
to verify his statements, and he did verify them in several
particulars.There were his signs out on the prairie stretches, and
here were his ads in the daily papers.It seemed not a bad way at all
in his idleness to start and make some money.The trouble with Lester was that he had reached the time where he
was not as keen for details as he had formerly been.All his work in
recent years--in fact, from the very beginning--had been
with large propositions, the purchasing of great quantities of
supplies, the placing of large orders, the discussion of things which
were wholesale and which had very little to do with the minor details
which make up the special interests of the smaller traders of the
world.In the factory his brother Robert had figured the pennies and
nickels of labor-cost, had seen to it that all the little leaks were
shut off.Lester had been left to deal with larger things, and he had
consistently done so.When it came to this particular proposition his
interest was in the wholesale phases of it, not the petty details of
selling.He could not help seeing that Chicago was a growing city, and
that land values must rise.What was now far-out prairie property
would soon, in the course of a few years, be well built-up suburban
residence territory.Scarcely any land that could be purchased now
would fall in value.It might drag in sales or increase, but it
couldn't fall.He knew it of his own
judgment to be true.The several things on which he did not speculate sufficiently were
the life or health of Mr.Ross; the chance that some obnoxious
neighborhood growth would affect the territory he had selected as
residence territory; the fact that difficult money situations might
reduce real estate values--in fact, bring about a flurry of real
estate liquidation which would send prices crashing down and cause the
failure of strong promoters, even such promoters for instance, as Mr.For several months he studied the situation as presented by his new
guide and mentor, and then, having satisfied himself that he was
reasonably safe, decided to sell some of the holdings which were
netting him a beggarly six per cent, and invest in this new
proposition.The first cash outlay was twenty thousand dollars for the
land, which was taken over under an operative agreement between
himself and Ross; this was run indefinitely--so long as there was
any of this land left to sell.The next thing was to raise twelve
thousand five hundred dollars for improvements, which he did, and then
to furnish some twenty-five hundred dollars more for taxes and
unconsidered expenses, items which had come up in carrying out the
improvement work which had been planned.It seemed that hard and soft
earth made a difference in grading costs, that trees would not always
flourish as expected, that certain members of the city water and gas
departments had to be "seen" and "fixed" before certain other
improvements could be effected.Ross attended to all this, but the
cost of the proceedings was something which had to be discussed, and
Lester heard it all.After the land was put in shape, about a year after the original
conversation, it was necessary to wait until spring for the proper
advertising and booming of the new section; and this advertising began
to call at once for the third payment.Lester disposed of an
additional fifteen thousand dollars worth of securities in order to
follow this venture to its logical and profitable conclusion.Up to this time he was rather pleased with his venture.Ross had
certainly been thorough and business-like in his handling of the
various details.It was given a
rather attractive title--"Inwood," although, as Lester noted,
there was precious little wood anywhere around there.But Ross assured
him that people looking for a suburban residence would be attracted by
the name; seeing the vigorous efforts in tree-planting that had been
made to provide for shade in the future, they would take the will for
the deed.The first chill wind that blew upon the infant project came in the
form of a rumor that the International Packing Company, one of the big
constituent members of the packing house combination at Halstead and
Thirty-ninth streets, had determined to desert the old group and lay
out a new packing area for itself.The papers explained that the
company intended to go farther south, probably below Fifty-fifth
Street and west of Ashland Avenue.This was the territory that was
located due west of Lester's property, and the mere suspicion that the
packing company might invade the territory was sufficient to blight
the prospects of any budding real estate deal.He decided, after quick
deliberation, that the best thing to do would be to boom the property
heavily, by means of newspaper advertising, and see if it could not be
disposed of before any additional damage was likely to be done to it.He laid the matter before Lester, who agreed that this would be
advisable.They had already expended six thousand dollars in
advertising, and now the additional sum of three thousand dollars was
spent in ten days, to make it appear that In wood was an ideal
residence section, equipped with every modern convenience for the
home-lover, and destined to be one of the most exclusive and beautiful
suburbs of the city.A few lots were sold, but the
rumor that the International Packing Company might come was persistent
and deadly; from any point of view, save that of a foreign population
neighborhood, the enterprise was a failure.To say that Lester was greatly disheartened by this blow is to put
it mildly.Practically fifty thousand dollars, two-thirds of all his
earthly possessions, outside of his stipulated annual income, was tied
up here; and there were taxes to pay, repairs to maintain, actual
depreciation in value to face.He suggested to Ross that the area
might be sold at its cost value, or a loan raised on it, and the whole
enterprise abandoned; but that experienced real estate dealer was not
so sanguine.He had had one or two failures of this kind before.He
was superstitious about anything which did not go smoothly from the
beginning.If it didn't go it was a hoodoo--a black
shadow--and he wanted no more to do with it.Other real estate
men, as he knew to his cost, were of the same opinion.Some three years later the property was sold under the sheriff's
hammer.Lester, having put in fifty thousand dollars all told,
recovered a trifle more than eighteen thousand; and some of his wise
friends assured him that he was lucky in getting off so easily.CHAPTER L


While the real estate deal was in progress Mrs.She had been staying in Cincinnati for a few months,
and had learned a great deal as to the real facts of Lester's
irregular mode of life.The question whether or not he was really
married to Jennie remained an open one.The garbled details of
Jennie's early years, the fact that a Chicago paper had written him up
as a young millionaire who was sacrificing his fortune for love of
her, the certainty that Robert had practically eliminated him from any
voice in the Kane Company, all came to her ears.She hated to think
that Lester was making such a sacrifice of himself.He had let nearly
a year slip by without doing anything.In two more years his chance
would be gone.He had said to her in London that he was without many
illusions.Did he really love her, or was he just
sorry for her?Letty wanted very much to find out for sure.Gerald leased in Chicago was a most imposing
one on Drexel Boulevard."I'm going to take a house in your town this
winter, and I hope to see a lot of you," she wrote to Lester."I'm
awfully bored with life here in Cincinnati.After Europe it's
so--well, you know.You ought to know that you have a loving friend in her.Her
daughter is going to marry Jimmy Severance in the spring."Lester thought of her coming with mingled feelings of pleasure and
uncertainty.Would she
foolishly begin by attempting to invite him and Jennie?That meant that Jennie would have to
be eliminated.He would have to make a clean breast of the whole
affair to Letty.Then she could do as she pleased about their future
intimacy.Seated in Letty's comfortable boudoir one afternoon, facing
a vision of loveliness in pale yellow, he decided that he might as
well have it out with her.Just at this time he
was beginning to doubt the outcome of the real estate deal, and
consequently he was feeling a little blue, and, as a concomitant, a
little confidential.He could not as yet talk to Jennie about his
troubles."You know, Lester," said Letty, by way of helping him to his
confession--the maid had brought tea for her and some brandy and
soda for him, and departed--"that I have been hearing a lot of
things about you since I've been back in this country.Aren't you
going to tell me all about yourself?You know I have your real
interests at heart.""What have you been hearing, Letty?""Oh, about your father's will for one thing, and the fact that
you're out of the company, and some gossip about Mrs.Kane which
doesn't interest me very much.Aren't you going
to straighten things out, so that you can have what rightfully belongs
to you?It seems to me such a great sacrifice, Lester, unless, of
course, you are very much in love.Lester paused and deliberated before replying."I really don't know
how to answer that last question, Letty," he said."Sometimes I think
that I love her; sometimes I wonder whether I do or not.I'm going to
be perfectly frank with you.I was never in such a curious position in
my life before.You like me so much, and I--well, I don't say
what I think of you," he smiled."But anyhow, I can talk to you
frankly."I thought as much," she said, as he paused."And I'm not married because I have never been able to make up my
mind just what to do about it.When I first met Jennie I thought her
the most entrancing girl I had ever laid eyes on.""That speaks volumes for my charms at that time," interrupted his
vis-a-vis."Don't interrupt me if you want to hear this," he smiled."Tell me one thing," she questioned, "and then I won't."There was something about her so--"

"Love at first sight," again interpolated Letty foolishly."Are you going to let me tell this?"I can't help a twinge or two.""Well, anyhow, I lost my head.I thought she was the most perfect
thing under the sun, even if she was a little out of my world.I thought that I could just take her, and
then--well, you know.I didn't
think that would prove as serious as it did.I never cared for any
other woman but you before and--I'll be frank--I didn't know
whether I wanted to marry you.I thought I didn't want to marry any
woman.I said to myself that I could just take Jennie, and then, after
a while, when things had quieted down some, we could separate."Yes, I understand," replied his confessor."Well, you see, Letty, it hasn't worked out that way.She's a woman
of a curious temperament.She possesses a world of feeling and
emotion.She's not educated in the sense in which we understand that
word, but she has natural refinement and tact.She's the most affectionate
creature under the sun.Her devotion to her mother and father was
beyond words.Her love for her--daughter she's hers, not
mine--is perfect.She hasn't any of the graces of the smart
society woman.She can't join in any
rapid-fire conversation.Some of
her big thoughts never come to the surface at all, but you can feel
that she is thinking and that she is feeling.""You pay her a lovely tribute, Lester," said Letty."She's a good woman, Letty; but, for all
that I have said, I sometimes think that it's only sympathy that's
holding me.""Don't be too sure," she said warningly."Yes, but I've gone through with a great deal.The thing for me to
have done was to have married her in the first place.There have been
so many entanglements since, so much rowing and discussion, that I've
rather lost my bearings.I
stand to lose eight hundred thousand if I marry her--really, a
great deal more, now that the company has been organized into a trust.If I don't marry her, I lose
everything outright in about two more years.Of course, I might
pretend that I have separated from her, but I don't care to lie.I
can't work it out that way without hurting her feelings, and she's
been the soul of devotion.Right down in my heart, at this minute, I
don't know whether I want to give her up.Honestly, I don't know what
the devil to do."Lester looked, lit a cigar in a far-off, speculative fashion, and
looked out of the window.questioned Letty, staring at the
floor.She rose, after a few moments of silence, and put her hands on
his round, solid head.Her yellow, silken house-gown, faintly scented,
touched his shoulders."You certainly have
tied yourself up in a knot.But it's a Gordian knot, my dear, and it
will have to be cut.Why don't you discuss this whole thing with her,
just as you have with me, and see how she feels about it?""It seems such an unkind thing to do," he replied."You must take some action, Lester dear," she insisted.Frankly, I
can't advise you to marry her; and I'm not speaking for myself in
that, though I'll take you gladly, even if you did forsake me in the
first place.I'll be perfectly honest--whether you ever come to
me or not--I love you, and always shall love you.""I know it," said Lester, getting up.He took her hands in his, and
studied her face curiously."But you're too big a man, Lester, to settle down on ten thousand a
year," she continued."You're too much of a social figure to drift.You ought to get back into the social and financial world where you
belong.All that's happened won't injure you, if you reclaim your
interest in the company.And if you
tell her the truth she won't object, I'm sure.If she cares for you,
as you think she does, she will be glad to make this sacrifice.You can provide for her handsomely, of course.""It isn't the money that Jennie wants," said Lester, gloomily."Well, even if it isn't, she can live without you and she can live
better for having an ample income.""She will never want if I can help it," he said solemnly."You must leave her," she urged, with a new touch of decisiveness.Why don't you make
up your mind to act at once--to-day, for that matter?To tell
you the truth, I hate to do it.I'm not one to run around and discuss my affairs with other people.I've refused to talk about this to any one heretofore--my father,
my mother, any one.But somehow you have always seemed closer to me
than any one else, and, since I met you this time, I have felt as
though I ought to explain--I have really wanted to.I don't know whether you understand how that can be under the
circumstances.You're nearer to me intellectually and
emotionally than I thought you were.You want the truth,
don't you?Now explain me to myself, if you
can.""I don't want to argue with you, Lester," she said softly, laying
her hand on his arm.I understand quite
well how it has all come about.I'm sorry--" she hesitated--"for Mrs.But she isn't the woman for
you, Lester; she really isn't.It seems so
unfair for us two to discuss her in this way, but really it isn't.We
all have to stand on our merits.And I'm satisfied, if the facts in
this case were put before her, as you have put them before me, she
would see just how it all is, and agree.Why, Lester, if I were in her position I would let you go.It would
hurt me, but I'd do it.It will hurt her, but she'll do it.Now, mark
you my words, she will.I think I understand her as well as you
do--better--for I am a woman.Oh," she said, pausing, "I
wish I were in a position to talk to her.Lester looked at Letty, wondering at her eagerness.She was
beautiful, magnetic, immensely worth while.She paused, a little crestfallen but determined."This is the time to act," she repeated, her whole soul in her
eyes.She wanted this man, and she was not ashamed to let him see that
she wanted him."Well, I'll think of it," he said uneasily, then, rather hastily,
he bade her good-by and went away.CHAPTER LI


Lester had thought of his predicament earnestly enough, and he
would have been satisfied to act soon if it had not been that one of
those disrupting influences which sometimes complicate our affairs
entered into his Hyde Park domicile.Gerhardt's health began rapidly
to fail.Little by little he had been obliged to give up his various duties
about the place; finally he was obliged to take to his bed.He lay in
his room, devotedly attended by Jennie and visited constantly by
Vesta, and occasionally by Lester.There was a window not far from his
bed, which commanded a charming view of the lawn and one of the
surrounding streets, and through this he would gaze by the hour,
wondering how the world was getting on without him.He suspected that
Woods, the coachman, was not looking after the horses and harnesses as
well as he should, that the newspaper carrier was getting negligent in
his delivery of the papers, that the furnace man was wasting coal, or
was not giving them enough heat.A score of little petty worries,
which were nevertheless real enough to him.He knew how a house should
be kept.He was always rigid in his performance of his self-appointed
duties, and he was so afraid that things would not go right.Jennie
made for him a most imposing and sumptuous dressing-gown of basted
wool, covered with dark-blue silk, and bought him a pair of soft,
thick, wool slippers to match, but he did not wear them often.He
preferred to lie in bed, read his Bible and the Lutheran papers, and
ask Jennie how things were getting along."I want you should go down in the basement and see what that feller
is doing.He's not giving us any heat," he would complain."I bet I
know what he does.He sits down there and reads, and then he forgets
what the fire is doing until it is almost out.The beer is right there
where he can take it.You don't know what kind
of a man he is.Jennie would protest that the house was fairly comfortable, that
the man was a nice, quiet, respectable-looking American--that if
he did drink a little beer it would not matter.Gerhardt would
immediately become incensed."That is always the way," he declared vigorously.You are always so ready to let things go if I am not
there.How do you know he is a nice man?If you don't watch
him he will be just like the others, no good.You should go around and
see how things are for yourself.""All right, papa," she would reply in a genial effort to soothe
him, "I will.Don't you
want a cup of coffee now and some toast?""No," Gerhardt would sigh immediately, "my stomach it don't do
right.I don't know how I am going to come out of this."Makin, the leading physician of the vicinity, and a man of
considerable experience and ability, called at Jennie's request and
suggested a few simple things--hot milk, a wine tonic, rest, but
he told Jennie that she must not expect too much."You know he is
quite well along in years now.If he were twenty
years younger we might do a great deal for him.As it is he is quite
well off where he is.He may get up and be
around again, and then he may not.I
have never any care as to what may happen to me.Jennie felt sorry to think that her father might die, but she was
pleased to think that if he must it was going to be under such
comfortable circumstances.It soon became evident that this was Gerhardt's last illness, and
Jennie thought it her duty to communicate with her brothers and
sisters.She wrote Bass that his father was not well, and had a letter
from him saying that he was very busy and couldn't come on unless the
danger was an immediate one.He went on to say that George was in
Rochester, working for a wholesale wall-paper house--the
Sheff-Jefferson Company, he thought.Martha and her husband had gone
to Boston.Her address was a little suburb named Belmont, just outside
the city.William was in Omaha, working for a local electric company.Veronica was married to a man named Albert Sheridan, who was connected
with a wholesale drug company in Cleveland."She never comes to see
me," complained Bass, "but I'll let her know."They
were very sorry, and would she let them know if anything happened.George wrote that he could not think of coming to Chicago unless his
father was very ill indeed, but that he would like to be informed from
time to time how he was getting along.William, as he told Jennie some
time afterward, did not get her letter.The progress of the old German's malady toward final dissolution
preyed greatly on Jennie's mind; for, in spite of the fact that they
had been so far apart in times past, they had now grown very close
together.Gerhardt had come to realize clearly that his outcast
daughter was goodness itself--at least, so far as he was
concerned.She never quarreled with him, never crossed him in any way.Now that he was sick, she was in and out of his room a dozen times in
an evening or an afternoon, seeing whether he was "all right," asking
how he liked his breakfast, or his lunch, or his dinner.As he grew
weaker she would sit by him and read, or do her sewing in his room.One day when she was straightening his pillow he took her hand and
kissed it.He was feeling very weak--and despondent.She looked
up in astonishment, a lump in her throat."You're a good girl, Jennie," he said brokenly.I've been hard and cross, but I'm an old man."Oh, papa, please don't," she pleaded, tears welling from her eyes.I'm the one who has been all
wrong.""No, no," he said; and she sank down on her knees beside him and
cried.He put his thin, yellow hand on her hair."There, there," he
said brokenly, "I understand a lot of things I didn't.She left the room, ostensibly to wash her face and hands, and cried
her eyes out.She tried to be more attentive, but that was impossible.But
after this reconciliation he seemed happier and more contented, and
they spent a number of happy hours together, just talking.Once he
said to her, "You know I feel just like I did when I was a boy.If it
wasn't for my bones I could get up and dance on the grass."Jennie fairly smiled and sobbed in one breath."You'll get
stronger, papa," she said.She was so glad she had been able to make him
comfortable these last few years.As for Lester, he was affectionate and considerate."Well, how is it to-night?"he would ask the moment he entered the
house, and he would always drop in for a few minutes before dinner to
see how the old man was getting along."He looks pretty well," he
would tell Jennie."He's apt to live some time yet.Vesta also spent much time with her grandfather, for she had come
to love him dearly.She would bring her books, if it didn't disturb
him too much, and recite some of her lessons, or she would leave his
door open, and play for him on the piano.Lester had bought her a
handsome music-box also, which she would sometimes carry to his room
and play for him.At times he wearied of everything and everybody save
Jennie; he wanted to be alone with her.She would sit beside him quite
still and sew.She could see plainly that the end was only a little
way off.Gerhardt, true to his nature, took into consideration all the
various arrangements contingent upon his death.He wished to be buried
in the little Lutheran cemetery, which was several miles farther out
on the South Side, and he wanted the beloved minister of his church to
officiate."Just my black suit and those
Sunday shoes of mine, and that black string tie.Jennie begged him not to talk of it, but he would.One day at four
o'clock he had a sudden sinking spell, and at five he was dead.Jennie
held his hands, watching his labored breathing; once or twice he
opened his eyes to smile at her."I don't mind going," he said, in
this final hour."Don't talk of dying, papa," she pleaded.The finish which time thus put to this troubled life affected
Jennie deeply.Strong in her kindly, emotional relationships, Gerhardt
had appealed to her not only as her father, but as a friend and
counselor.She saw him now in his true perspective, a hard-working,
honest, sincere old German, who had done his best to raise a
troublesome family and lead an honest life.Truly she had been his one
great burden, and she had never really dealt truthfully with him to
the end.She wondered now if where he was he could see that she had
lied.Telegrams were sent to all the children.Bass wired that he was
coming, and arrived the next day.The others wired that they could not
come, but asked for details, which Jennie wrote.The Lutheran minister
was called in to say prayers and fix the time of the burial service.A
fat, smug undertaker was commissioned to arrange all the details.Some
few neighborhood friends called--those who had remained most
faithful--and on the second morning following his death the
services were held.Lester accompanied Jennie and Vesta and Bass to
the little red brick Lutheran church, and sat stolidly through the
rather dry services.He listened wearily to the long discourse on the
beauties and rewards of a future life and stirred irritably when
reference was made to a hell.Bass was rather bored, but considerate.He looked upon his father now much as he would on any other man.Only
Jennie wept sympathetically.She saw her father in perspective, the
long years of trouble he had had, the days in which he had had to saw
wood for a living, the days in which he had lived in a factory loft,
the little shabby house they had been compelled to live in in
Thirteenth Street, the terrible days of suffering they had spent in
Lorrie Street, in Cleveland, his grief over her, his grief over Mrs.Gerhardt, his love and care of Vesta, and finally these last days."Oh, he was a good man," she thought.They sang
a hymn, "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God," and then she sobbed.He was moved to the danger-line himself
by her grief."You'll have to do better than this," he whispered."My
God, I can't stand it.I'll have to get up and get out."Jennie
quieted a little, but the fact that the last visible ties were being
broken between her and her father was almost too much.At the grave in the Cemetery of the Redeemer, where Lester had
immediately arranged to purchase a lot, they saw the plain coffin
lowered and the earth shoveled in.Lester looked curiously at the bare
trees, the brown dead grass, and the brown soil of the prairie turned
up at this simple graveside.There was no distinction to this burial
plot.It was commonplace and shabby, a working-man's resting-place,
but so long as he wanted it, it was all right.He studied Bass's keen,
lean face, wondering what sort of a career he was cutting out for
himself.Bass looked to him like some one who would run a cigar store
successfully.He watched Jennie wiping her red eyes, and then he said
to himself again, "Well, there is something to her."The woman's
emotion was so deep, so real."There's no explaining a good woman," he
said to himself.On the way home, through the wind-swept, dusty streets, he talked
of life in general, Bass and Vesta being present."Jennie takes things
too seriously," he said.Life isn't as
bad as she makes out with her sensitive feelings.We all have our
troubles, and we all have to stand them, some more, some less.We
can't assume that any one is so much better or worse off than any one
else."I can't help it," said Jennie."I feel so sorry for some
people.""Jennie always was a little gloomy," put in Bass.He was thinking what a fine figure of a man Lester was, how
beautifully they lived, how Jennie had come up in the world.He was
thinking that there must be a lot more to her than he had originally
thought.At one time he thought Jennie
was a hopeless failure and no good."You ought to try to steel yourself to take things as they come
without going to pieces this way," said Lester finally.Jennie stared thoughtfully out of the carriage window.There was
the old house now, large and silent without Gerhardt.Just think, she
would never see him any more.They finally turned into the drive and
entered the library.Jeannette, nervous and sympathetic, served tea.She wondered curiously
where she would be when she died.CHAPTER LII


The fact that Gerhardt was dead made no particular difference to
Lester, except as it affected Jennie.He had liked the old German for
his many sterling qualities, but beyond that he thought nothing of him
one way or the other.He took Jennie to a watering-place for ten days
to help her recover her spirits, and it was soon after this that he
decided to tell her just how things stood with him; he would put the
problem plainly before her.It would be easier now, for Jennie had
been informed of the disastrous prospects of the real-estate deal.She
was also aware of his continued interest in Mrs.Lester did
not hesitate to let Jennie know that he was on very friendly terms
with her.Gerald had, at first, formally requested him to bring
Jennie to see her, but she never had called herself, and Jennie
understood quite clearly that it was not to be.Now that her father
was dead, she was beginning to wonder what was going to become of her;
she was afraid that Lester might not marry her.Certainly he showed no
signs of intending to do so.By one of those curious coincidences of thought, Robert also had
reached the conclusion that something should be done.He did not, for
one moment, imagine that he could directly work upon Lester--he
did not care to try--but he did think that some influence might
be brought to bear on Jennie.If
Lester had not married her already, she must realize full well that he
did not intend to do so.Suppose that some responsible third person
were to approach her, and explain how things were, including, of
course, the offer of an independent income?Might she not be willing
to leave Lester, and end all this trouble?After all, Lester was his
brother, and he ought not to lose his fortune.Robert had things very
much in his own hands now, and could afford to be generous.O'Brien, of Knight, Keatley & O'Brien, would be
the proper intermediary, for O'Brien was suave, good-natured, and
well-meaning, even if he was a lawyer.He might explain to Jennie very
delicately just how the family felt, and how much Lester stood to lose
if he continued to maintain his connection with her.If Lester had
married Jennie, O'Brien would find it out.A liberal provision would
be made for her--say fifty or one hundred thousand, or even one
hundred and fifty thousand dollars.O'Brien and gave
him his instructions.As one of the executors of Archibald Kane's
estate, it was really the lawyer's duty to look into the matter of
Lester's ultimate decision.On reaching the city, he called
up Lester, and found out to his satisfaction that he was out of town
for the day.He went out to the house in Hyde Park, and sent in his
card to Jennie.She came down-stairs in a few minutes quite
unconscious of the import of his message; he greeted her most
blandly.he asked, with an interlocutory jerk of his
head."I am, as you see by my card, Mr.O'Brien, of Knight, Keatley &
O'Brien," he began."We are the attorneys and executors of the late
Mr.You'll think it's
rather curious, my coming to you, but under your husband's father's
will there were certain conditions stipulated which affect you and Mr.These provisions are so important that I think
you ought to know about them--that is if Mr.I--pardon me--but the peculiar nature of them
makes me conclude that--possibly--he hasn't."He paused, a
very question-mark of a man--every feature of his face an
interrogation."I don't quite understand," said Jennie."I don't know anything
about the will.If there's anything that I ought to know, I suppose
Mr.Now, if you will allow me I'll go into the matter briefly.Then you
can judge for yourself whether you wish to hear the full particulars.Jennie seated
herself, and Mr.O'Brien pulled up a chair near to hers."I need not say to you, of course, that
there was considerable opposition on the part of Mr.Kane's father, to
this--ah--union between yourself and his son.""I know--" Jennie started to say, but checked herself.She was
puzzled, disturbed, and a little apprehensive.Kane senior died," he went on, "he indicated to
your--ah--to Mr.Lester Kane, that he felt this way.In his
will he made certain conditions governing the distribution of his
property which made it rather hard for his son,
your--ah--husband, to come into his rightful share.Ordinarily, he would have inherited one-fourth of the Kane
Manufacturing Company, worth to-day in the neighborhood of a million
dollars, perhaps more; also one-fourth of the other properties, which
now aggregate something like five hundred thousand dollars.Kane senior was really very anxious that his son should inherit
this property.But owing to the conditions which
your--ah--which Mr.Lester Kane
cannot possibly obtain his share, except by complying with
a--with a--certain wish which his father had expressed."O'Brien paused, his eyes moving back and forth side wise in
their sockets.In spite of the natural prejudice of the situation, he
was considerably impressed with Jennie's pleasing appearance.He could
see quite plainly why Lester might cling to her in the face of all
opposition.He continued to study her furtively as he sat there
waiting for her to speak.she finally asked, her nerves becoming
just a little tense under the strain of the silence."I am glad you were kind enough to ask me that," he went on."The
subject is a very difficult one for me to introduce--very
difficult.I come as an emissary of the estate, I might say as one of
the executors under the will of Mr.I know how keenly
your--ah--how keenly Mr.I know how
keenly you will probably feel about it.But it is one of those very
difficult things which cannot be helped--which must be got over
somehow.And while I hesitate very much to say so, I must tell you
that Mr.Kane senior stipulated in his will that unless,
unless"--again his eyes were moving sidewise to and fro--"he
saw fit to separate from--ah--you" he paused to get
breath--"he could not inherit this or any other sum or, at least,
only a very minor income of ten thousand a year; and that only on
condition that he should marry you.""I should add,"
he went on, "that under the will he was given three years in which to
indicate his intentions.He paused, half expecting some outburst of feeling from Jennie, but
she only looked at him fixedly, her eyes clouded with surprise,
distress, unhappiness.Lester was sacrificing his
fortune for her.His recent commercial venture was an effort to
rehabilitate himself, to put himself in an independent position.The
recent periods of preoccupation, of subtle unrest, and of
dissatisfaction over which she had grieved were now explained.He was
unhappy, he was brooding over this prospective loss, and he had never
told her.So his father had really disinherited him!O'Brien sat before her, troubled himself.He was very sorry for
her, now that he saw the expression of her face."I'm sorry," he said, when he saw that she was not going to make
any immediate reply, "that I have been the bearer of such unfortunate
news.It is a very painful situation that I find myself in at this
moment, I assure you.I bear you no ill will personally--of
course you understand that.The family really bears you no ill will
now--I hope you believe that.As I told your--ah--as I
told Mr.Kane, at the time the will was read, I considered it most
unfair, but, of course, as a mere executive under it and counsel for
his father, I could do nothing.I really think it best that you should
know how things stand, in order that you may help your--your
husband"--he paused, significantly--"if possible, to some
solution.It seems a pity to me, as it does to the various other
members of his family, that he should lose all this money."Jennie had turned her head away and was staring at the floor."He mustn't lose it," she said; "it isn't fair
that he should.""I am most delighted to hear you say that, Mrs.--Mrs.Kane,"
he went on, using for the first time her improbable title as Lester's
wife, without hesitation."I may as well be very frank with you, and
say that I feared you might take this information in quite another
spirit.Of course you know to begin with that the Kane family is very
clannish.Kane, your--ah--your husband's mother, was a
very proud and rather distant woman, and his sisters and brothers are
rather set in their notions as to what constitute proper family
connections.They look upon his relationship to you as irregular,
and--pardon me if I appear to be a little cruel--as not
generally satisfactory.As you know, there had been so much talk in
the last few years that Mr.Kane senior did not believe that the
situation could ever be nicely adjusted, so far as the family was
concerned.He felt that his son had not gone about it right in the
first place.One of the conditions of his will was that if your
husband--pardon me--if his son did not accept the
proposition in regard to separating from you and taking up his
rightful share of the estate, then to inherit anything at
all--the mere ten thousand a year I mentioned before--he
must--ah--he must pardon me, I seem a little brutal, but not
intentionally so--marry you."It was such a cruel thing to say this to her face.This whole attempt to live together illegally had proved disastrous at
every step.There was only one solution to the unfortunate
business--she could see that plainly.She must leave him, or he
must leave her.Lester living on ten
thousand dollars a year!He was thinking that Lester
both had and had not made a mistake.Why had he not married her in the
first place?"There is just one other point which I wish to make in this
connection, Mrs.Kane," he went on softly and easily."I see now that
it will not make any difference to you, but I am commissioned and in a
way constrained to make it.I hope you will take it in the manner in
which it is given.I don't know whether you are familiar with your
husband's commercial interests or not?""Well, in order to simplify matters, and to make it easier for you,
should you decide to assist your husband to a solution of this very
difficult situation--frankly, in case you might possibly decide
to leave on your own account, and maintain a separate establishment of
your own I am delighted to say that--ah--any sum,
say--ah--"

Jennie rose and walked dazedly to one of the windows, clasping her
hands as she went.In the event of your deciding to end the
connection it has been suggested that any reasonable sum you might
name, fifty, seventy-five, a hundred thousand dollars"--Mr.O'Brien was feeling very generous toward her--"would be gladly
set aside for your benefit--put in trust, as it were, so that you
would have it whenever you needed it."Please don't," said Jennie, hurt beyond the power to express
herself, unable mentally and physically to listen to another word.But please don't talk to
me any more, will you?"O'Brien, coming
to a keen realization of her sufferings.It has been very hard for me to do
this--very hard.I will come any time you suggest, or you can write me.I hope you will see fit
to say nothing to your husband of my visit--it will be advisable
that you should keep your own counsel in the matter.I value his
friendship very highly, and I am sincerely sorry."O'Brien went out into the hall to get his coat.Jennie touched
the electric button to summon the maid, and Jeannette came.Jennie
went back into the library, and Mr.O'Brien paced briskly down the
front walk.When she was really alone she put her doubled hands to her
chin, and stared at the floor, the queer design of the silken Turkish
rug resolving itself into some curious picture.She saw herself in a
small cottage somewhere, alone with Vesta; she saw Lester living in
another world, and beside him Mrs.She saw this house vacant,
and then a long stretch of time, and then--

"Oh," she sighed, choking back a desire to cry.With her hands she
brushed away a hot tear from each eye."It must be," she said to herself in thought.And then--"Oh, thank God that papa
is dead Anyhow, he did not live to see this."CHAPTER LIII


The explanation which Lester had concluded to be inevitable,
whether it led to separation or legalization of their hitherto banal
condition, followed quickly upon the appearance of Mr.O'Brien called he had gone on a journey to Hegewisch, a small
manufacturing town in Wisconsin, where he had been invited to witness
the trial of a new motor intended to operate elevators--with a
view to possible investment.When he came out to the house, interested
to tell Jennie something about it even in spite of the fact that he
was thinking of leaving her, he felt a sense of depression everywhere,
for Jennie, in spite of the serious and sensible conclusion she had
reached, was not one who could conceal her feelings easily.She was
brooding sadly over her proposed action, realizing that it was best to
leave but finding it hard to summon the courage which would let her
talk to him about it.She could not go without telling him what she
thought.She was absolutely convinced
that this one course of action--separation--was necessary
and advisable.She could not think of him as daring to make a
sacrifice of such proportions for her sake even if he wanted to.It was astonishing to her that he had let things go
along as dangerously and silently as he had.When he came in Jennie did her best to greet him with her
accustomed smile, but it was a pretty poor imitation.she asked, using her customary phrase of
inquiry.She walked with him to the library, and he
poked at the open fire with a long-handled poker before turning around
to survey the room generally.It was five o'clock of a January
afternoon.Jennie had gone to one of the windows to lower the shade.As she came back he looked at her critically."You're not quite your
usual self, are you?"he asked, sensing something out of the common in
her attitude."Why, yes, I feel all right," she replied, but there was a peculiar
uneven motion to the movement of her lips--a rippling tremor
which was unmistakable to him."I think I know better than that," he said, still gazing at her
steadily.She turned away from him a moment to get her breath and collect her
senses."There is something," she managed to
say."I know you have," he agreed, half smiling, but with a feeling that
there was much of grave import back of this.She was silent for a moment, biting her lips.She did not quite
know how to begin.Finally she broke the spell with: "There was a man
here yesterday--a Mr."He came to talk to me about you and your father's will."She paused, for his face clouded immediately."Why the devil should
he be talking to you about my father's will!""Please don't get angry, Lester," said Jennie calmly, for she
realized that she must remain absolute mistress of herself if anything
were to be accomplished toward the resolution of her problem."He
wanted to tell me what a sacrifice you are making," she went on."He
wished to show me that there was only a little time left before you
would lose your inheritance."What the devil does he mean by
putting his nose in my private affairs?"This is some
of Robert's work.Why should Knight, Keatley & O'Brien be meddling
in my affairs?This whole business is getting to be a nuisance!"He
was in a boiling rage in a moment, as was shown by his darkening skin
and sulphurous eyes.He came to himself sufficiently after a time to add:

"Well."He said that if you married me you would only get ten thousand a
year.That if you didn't and still lived with me you would get nothing
at all.If you would leave me, or I would leave you, you would get all
of a million and a half.Don't you think you had better leave me
now?"She had not intended to propound this leading question so quickly,
but it came out as a natural climax to the situation.She realized
instantly that if he were really in love with her he would answer with
an emphatic "no."If he didn't care, he would hesitate, he would
delay, he would seek to put off the evil day of reckoning."I don't see that," he retorted irritably."I don't see that
there's any need for either interference or hasty action.What I
object to is their coming here and mixing in my private affairs."Jennie was cut to the quick by his indifference, his wrath instead
of affection.To her the main point at issue was her leaving him or
his leaving her.To him this recent interference was obviously the
chief matter for discussion and consideration.The meddling of others
before he was ready to act was the terrible thing.She had hoped, in
spite of what she had seen, that possibly, because of the long time
they had lived together and the things which (in a way) they had
endured together, he might have come to care for her deeply--that
she had stirred some emotion in him which would never brook real
separation, though some seeming separation might be necessary.He had
not married her, of course, but then there had been so many things
against them.Now, in this final hour, anyhow, he might have shown
that he cared deeply, even if he had deemed it necessary to let her
go.She felt for the time being as if, for all that she had lived with
him so long, she did not understand him, and yet, in spite of this
feeling, she knew also that she did.He could
not care for any one enthusiastically and demonstratively.He could
care enough to seize her and take her to himself as he had, but he
could not care enough to keep her if something more important
appeared.She was in a quandary, hurt,
bleeding, but for once in her life, determined.Whether he wanted to
or not, she must not let him make this sacrifice.She must leave
him--if he would not leave her.It was not important enough that
she should stay."Don't you think you had better act soon?"she continued, hoping
that some word of feeling would come from him."There is only a little
time left, isn't there?"Jennie nervously pushed a book to and fro on the table, her fear
that she would not be able to keep up appearances troubling her
greatly.It was hard for her to know what to do or say.Lester was so
terrible when he became angry.Still it ought not to be so hard for
him to go, now that he had Mrs.Gerald, if he only wished to do
so--and he ought to.His fortune was so much more important to
him than anything she could be."Don't worry about that," he replied stubbornly, his wrath at his
brother, and his family, and O'Brien still holding him.I don't know what I want to do yet.I like the effrontery of
these people!But I won't talk any more about it; isn't dinner nearly
ready?"He was so injured in his pride that he scarcely took the
trouble to be civil.He was forgetting all about her and what she was
feeling.He hated his brother Robert for this affront.He would have
enjoyed wringing the necks of Messrs.Knight, Keatley & O'Brien,
singly and collectively.The question could not be dropped for good and all, and it came up
again at dinner, after Jennie had done her best to collect her
thoughts and quiet her nerves.They could not talk very freely because
of Vesta and Jeannette, but she managed to get in a word or two."I could take a little cottage somewhere," she suggested softly,
hoping to find him in a modified mood.I would not know what to do with a big house like this alone.""I wish you wouldn't discuss this business any longer, Jennie," he
persisted.I don't know that I'm going to do
anything of the sort.I don't know what I'm going to do."He was so
sour and obstinate, because of O'Brien, that she finally gave it up.Vesta was astonished to see her stepfather, usually so courteous, in
so grim a mood.Jennie felt a curious sense that she might hold him if she would,
for he was doubting; but she knew also that she should not wish.It was not fair to herself, or kind, or
decent."Oh yes, Lester, you must," she pleaded, at a later time."I won't
talk about it any more, but you must.I won't let you do anything
else."There were hours when it came up afterward--every day, in
fact--in their boudoir, in the library, in the dining-room, at
breakfast, but not always in words.She was sure that he should be made to
act.Since he was showing more kindly consideration for her, she was
all the more certain that he should act soon.Just how to go about it
she did not know, but she looked at him longingly, trying to help him
make up his mind.She would be happy, she assured herself--she
would be happy thinking that he was happy once she was away from him.He was a good man, most delightful in everything, perhaps, save his
gift of love.He really did not love her--could not perhaps,
after all that had happened, even though she loved him most earnestly.But his family had been most brutal in their opposition, and this had
affected his attitude.She could see
now how his big, strong brain might be working in a circle.He was too
decent to be absolutely brutal about this thing and leave her, too
really considerate to look sharply after his own interests as he
should, or hers--but he ought to."You must decide, Lester," she kept saying to him, from time to
time.Maybe, when this thing is all over you might want to come back
to me."I'm not ready to come to a decision," was his invariable reply."I
don't know that I want to leave you.This money is important, of
course, but money isn't everything.I can live on ten thousand a year
if necessary."Oh, but you're so much more placed in the world now, Lester," she
argued.Look how much it costs to run this house
alone.And a million and a half of dollars--why, I wouldn't let
you think of losing that."Where would you think of going if it came to that?"Do you remember that little town of
Sandwood, this side of Kenosha?I have often thought it would be a
pleasant place to live.""I don't like to think of this," he said finally in an outburst of
frankness.The conditions have all been against
this union of ours.I suppose I should have married you in the first
place.Jennie choked in her throat, but said nothing."Anyhow, this won't be the last of it, if I can help it," he
concluded.He was thinking that the storm might blow over; once he had
the money, and then--but he hated compromises and
subterfuges.It came by degrees to be understood that, toward the end of
February, she should look around at Sandwood and see what she could
find.She was to have ample means, he told her, everything that she
wanted.After a time he might come out and visit her occasionally.And
he was determined in his heart that he would make some people pay for
the trouble they had caused him.O'Brien
shortly and talk things over.He wanted for his personal satisfaction
to tell him what he thought of him.At the same time, in the background of his mind, moved the shadowy
figure of Mrs.Gerald--charming, sophisticated, well placed in
every sense of the word.He did not want to give her the broad reality
of full thought, but she was always there."Perhaps I'd better," he half concluded.When February came he was
ready to act.CHAPTER LIV


The little town of Sandwood, "this side of Kenosha," as Jennie had
expressed it, was only a short distance from Chicago, an hour and
fifteen minutes by the local train.It had a population of some three
hundred families, dwelling in small cottages, which were scattered
over a pleasant area of lake-shore property.The houses were not worth more than from three to five
thousand dollars each, but, in most cases, they were harmoniously
constructed, and the surrounding trees, green for the entire year,
gave them a pleasing summery appearance.Jennie, at the time they had
passed by there--it was an outing taken behind a pair of fast
horses--had admired the look of a little white church steeple,
set down among green trees, and the gentle rocking of the boats upon
the summer water."I should like to live in a place like this some time," she had
said to Lester, and he had made the comment that it was a little too
peaceful for him."I can imagine getting to the place where I might
like this, but not now.It came to her when
she thought that the world was trying.If she had to be alone ever and
could afford it she would like to live in a place like Sandwood.There
she would have a little garden, some chickens, perhaps, a tall pole
with a pretty bird-house on it, and flowers and trees and green grass
everywhere about.If she could have a little cottage in a place like
this which commanded a view of the lake she could sit of a summer
evening and sew.Vesta could play about or come home from school.She
might have a few friends, or not any.She was beginning to think that
she could do very well living alone if it were not for Vesta's social
needs.Books were pleasant things--she was finding that
out--books like Irving's Sketch Book, Lamb's Elia,
and Hawthorne's Twice Told Tales.Vesta was coming to be quite
a musician in her way, having a keen sense of the delicate and refined
in musical composition.She had a natural sense of harmony and a love
for those songs and instrumental compositions which reflect
sentimental and passionate moods; and she could sing and play quite
well.Her voice was, of course, quite untrained--she was only
fourteen--but it was pleasant to listen to.She was beginning to
show the combined traits of her mother and father--Jennie's
gentle, speculative turn of mind, combined with Brander's vivacity of
spirit and innate executive capacity.She could talk to her mother in
a sensible way about things, nature, books, dress, love, and from her
developing tendencies Jennie caught keen glimpses of the new worlds
which Vesta was to explore.The nature of modern school life, its
consideration of various divisions of knowledge, music, science, all
came to Jennie watching her daughter take up new themes.Vesta was
evidently going to be a woman of considerable ability--not
irritably aggressive, but self-constructive.She would be able to take
care of herself.All this pleased Jennie and gave her great hopes for
Vesta's future.The cottage which was finally secured at Sandwood was only a story
and a half in height, but it was raised upon red brick piers between
which were set green lattices and about which ran a veranda.The house
was long and narrow, its full length--some five rooms in a
row--facing the lake.There was a dining-room with windows
opening even with the floor, a large library with built-in shelves for
books, and a parlor whose three large windows afforded air and
sunshine at all times.The plot of ground in which this cottage stood was one hundred feet
square and ornamented with a few trees.The former owner had laid out
flower-beds, and arranged green hardwood tubs for the reception of
various hardy plants and vines.The house was painted white, with
green shutters and green shingles.It had been Lester's idea, since this thing must be, that Jennie
might keep the house in Hyde Park just as it was, but she did not want
to do that.At first, she did not think she would take
anything much with her, but she finally saw that it was advisable to
do as Lester suggested--to fit out the new place with a selection
of silverware, hangings, and furniture from the Hyde Park house.Daniel moved to the office."You have no idea what you will or may want," he said.A lease of the cottage was taken for two years, together with an
option for an additional five years, including the privilege of
purchase.So long as he was letting her go, Lester wanted to be
generous.He could not think of her as wanting for anything, and he
did not propose that she should.His one troublesome thought was, what
explanation was to be made to Vesta.He liked her very much and wanted
her "life kept free of complications."Why not send her off to a boarding-school until spring?"he
suggested once; but owing to the lateness of the season this was
abandoned as inadvisable.Later they agreed that business affairs made
it necessary for him to travel and for Jennie to move.Later Vesta
could be told that Jennie had left him for any reason she chose to
give.It was a trying situation, all the more bitter to Jennie because
she realized that in spite of the wisdom of it indifference to her was
involved.He really did not care enough, as much as he
cared.The relationship of man and woman which we study so passionately in
the hope of finding heaven knows what key to the mystery of existence
holds no more difficult or trying situation than this of mutual
compatibility broken or disrupted by untoward conditions which in
themselves have so little to do with the real force and beauty of the
relationship itself.These days of final dissolution in which this
household, so charmingly arranged, the scene of so many pleasant
activities, was literally going to pieces was a period of great trial
to both Jennie and Lester.On her part it was one of intense
suffering, for she was of that stable nature that rejoices to fix
itself in a serviceable and harmonious relationship, and then stay so.For her life was made up of those mystic chords of sympathy and memory
which bind up the transient elements of nature into a harmonious and
enduring scene.One of those chords--this home was her home,
united and made beautiful by her affection and consideration for each
person and every object.Now the time had come when it must cease.If she had ever had anything before in her life which had been like
this it might have been easier to part with it now, though, as she had
proved, Jennie's affections were not based in any way upon material
considerations.Her love of life and of personality were free from the
taint of selfishness.She went about among these various rooms
selecting this rug, that set of furniture, this and that ornament,
wishing all the time with all her heart and soul that it need not be.Just to think, in a little while Lester would not come any more of an
evening!She would not need to get up first of a morning and see that
coffee was made for her lord, that the table in the dining-room looked
just so.It had been a habit of hers to arrange a bouquet for the
table out of the richest blooming flowers of the conservatory, and she
had always felt in doing it that it was particularly for him.Now it
would not be necessary any more--not for him.When one is
accustomed to wait for the sound of a certain carriage-wheel of an
evening grating upon your carriage drive, when one is used to listen
at eleven, twelve, and one, waking naturally and joyfully to the echo
of a certain step on the stair, the separation, the ending of these
things, is keen with pain.These were the thoughts that were running
through Jennie's brain hour after hour and day after day.Lester on his part was suffering in another fashion.His was not
the sorrow of lacerated affection, of discarded and despised love, but
of that painful sense of unfairness which comes to one who knows that
he is making a sacrifice of the virtues--kindness, loyalty,
affection--to policy.Policy was dictating a very splendid course
of action from one point of view.Free of Jennie, providing for her
admirably, he was free to go his way, taking to himself the mass of
affairs which come naturally with great wealth.He could not help
thinking of the thousand and one little things which Jennie had been
accustomed to do for him, the hundred and one comfortable and pleasant
and delightful things she meant to him.The virtues which she
possessed were quite dear to his mind.He had gone over them time and
again.Now he was compelled to go over them finally, to see that she
was suffering without making a sign.Her manner and attitude toward
him in these last days were quite the same as they had always
been--no more, no less.She was not indulging in private
hysterics, as another woman might have done; she was not pretending a
fortitude in suffering she did not feel, showing him one face while
wishing him to see another behind it.She was calm, gentle,
considerate--thoughtful of him--where he would go and what
he would do, without irritating him by her inquiries.He was struck
quite favorably by her ability to take a large situation largely, and
he admired her.There was something to this woman, let the world think
what it might.It was a shame that her life was passed under such a
troubled star.The sound of its
voice was in his ears.It had on occasion shown him its bared teeth.The last hour came, when having made excuses to this and that
neighbor, when having spread the information that they were going
abroad, when Lester had engaged rooms at the Auditorium, and the mass
of furniture which could not be used had gone to storage, that it was
necessary to say farewell to this Hyde Park domicile.Jennie had
visited Sandwood in company with Lester several times.He had
carefully examined the character of the place.He was satisfied that
it was nice but lonely.Spring was at hand, the flowers would be
something.She was going to keep a gardener and man of all work."Very well," he said, "only I want you to be comfortable."In the mean time Lester had been arranging his personal affairs.Knight, Keatley & O'Brien through his own
attorney, Mr.Watson, that he would expect them to deliver his share
of his father's securities on a given date.He had made up his mind
that as long as he was compelled by circumstances to do this thing he
would do a number of other things equally ruthless.He would sit as a director in the United Carriage
Company--with his share of the stock it would be impossible to
keep him out.Gerald's money he would become a
controlling factor in the United Traction of Cincinnati, in which his
brother was heavily interested, and in the Western Steel Works, of
which his brother was now the leading adviser.What a different figure
he would be now from that which he had been during the past few
years!Jennie was depressed to the point of despair.When she first came here
and neighbors had begun to drop in she had imagined herself on the
threshold of a great career, that some day, possibly, Lester would
marry her.Now, blow after blow had been delivered, and the home and
dream were a ruin.Jeannette, Harry Ward, and Mrs.Frissell had been discharged, the furniture for a good part was in
storage, and for her, practically, Lester was no more.She realized
clearly that he would not come back.If he could do this thing now,
even considerately, he could do much more when he was free and away
later.Immersed in his great affairs, he would forget, of course.Had not everything--everything
illustrated that to her?Love was not enough in this world--that
was so plain.One needed education, wealth, training, the ability to
fight and scheme, She did not want to do that.The day came when the house was finally closed and the old life was
at an end.Lester traveled with Jennie to Sandwood.He spent some
little while in the house trying to get her used to the idea of
change--it was not so bad.He intimated that he would come again
soon, but he went away, and all his words were as nothing against the
fact of the actual and spiritual separation.When Jennie saw him going
down the brick walk that afternoon, his solid, conservative figure
clad in a new tweed suit, his overcoat on his arm, self-reliance and
prosperity written all over him, she thought that she would die.She
had kissed Lester good-by and had wished him joy, prosperity, peace;
then she made an excuse to go to her bedroom.Vesta came after a time,
to seek her, but now her eyes were quite dry; everything had subsided
to a dull ache.The new life was actually begun for her--a life
without Lester, without Gerhardt, without any one save Vesta.she thought, as she went
into the kitchen, for she had determined to do at least some of her
own work.If it
were not for Vesta she would have sought some regular outside
employment.Anything to keep from brooding, for in that direction lay
madness.CHAPTER LV


The social and business worlds of Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland,
and other cities saw, during the year or two which followed the
breaking of his relationship with Jennie, a curious rejuvenation in
the social and business spirit of Lester Kane.He had become rather
distant and indifferent to certain personages and affairs while he was
living with her, but now he suddenly appeared again, armed with
authority from a number of sources, looking into this and that matter
with the air of one who has the privilege of power, and showing
himself to be quite a personage from the point of view of finance and
commerce.It must be admitted that he was in
some respects a mentally altered Lester.Up to the time he had met
Jennie he was full of the assurance of the man who has never known
defeat.To have been reared in luxury as he had been, to have seen
only the pleasant side of society, which is so persistent and so
deluding where money is concerned, to have been in the run of big
affairs not because one has created them, but because one is a part of
them and because they are one's birthright, like the air one breathes,
could not help but create one of those illusions of solidarity which
is apt to befog the clearest brain.It is so hard for us to know what
we have not seen.It is so difficult for us to feel what we have not
experienced.Like this world of ours, which seems so solid and
persistent solely because we have no knowledge of the power which
creates it, Lester's world seemed solid and persistent and real enough
to him.It was only when the storms set in and the winds of adversity
blew and he found himself facing the armed forces of convention that
he realized he might be mistaken as to the value of his personality,
that his private desires and opinions were as nothing in the face of a
public conviction; that he was wrong.The race spirit, or social
avatar, the "Zeitgeist" as the Germans term it, manifested itself as
something having a system in charge, and the organization of society
began to show itself to him as something based on possibly a
spiritual, or, at least, superhuman counterpart.He could not fly in
the face of it.The
people of his time believed that some particular form of social
arrangement was necessary, and unless he complied with that he could,
as he saw, readily become a social outcast.His own father and mother
had turned on him--his brother and sisters, society, his friends.Dear heaven, what a to-do this action of his had created!Why, even
the fates seemed adverse.His real estate venture was one of the most
fortuitously unlucky things he had ever heard of.Were the gods
battling on the side of a to him unimportant social arrangement?Anyhow, he had been compelled to quit, and here he was,
vigorous, determined, somewhat battered by the experience, but still
forceful and worth while.And it was a part of the penalty that he had become measurably
soured by what had occurred.He was feeling that he had been compelled
to do the first ugly, brutal thing of his life.It was a shame to forsake her after all the devotion she had
manifested.Truly she had played a finer part than he.Worst of all,
his deed could not be excused on the grounds of necessity.He could
have lived on ten thousand a year; he could have done without the
million and more which was now his.He could have done without the
society, the pleasures of which had always been a lure.He could have,
but he had not, and he had complicated it all with the thought of
another woman.That was a question which always rose
before him.Wasn't she deliberately scheming under
his very eyes to win him away from the woman who was as good as his
wife?Was it the thing a truly big woman would do?Ought he
to marry any one seeing that he really owed a spiritual if not a legal
allegiance to Jennie?Was it worth while for any woman to marry him?He could not shut
out the fact that he was doing a cruel and unlovely thing.Material error in the first place was now being complicated with
spiritual error.He was attempting to right the first by committing
the second.He was
thinking, thinking, all the while he was readjusting his life to the
old (or perhaps better yet, new) conditions, and he was not feeling
any happier.As a matter of fact he was feeling worse--grim,
revengeful.If he married Letty he thought at times it would be to use
her fortune as a club to knock other enemies over the head, and he
hated to think he was marrying her for that.He took up his abode at
the Auditorium, visited Cincinnati in a distant and aggressive spirit,
sat in council with the board of directors, wishing that he was more
at peace with himself, more interested in life.But he did not change
his policy in regard to Jennie.Gerald had been vitally interested in Lester's
rehabilitation.She waited tactfully some little time before sending
him any word; finally she ventured to write to him at the Hyde Park
address (as if she did not know where he was), asking, "Where are
you?"By this time Lester had become slightly accustomed to the change
in his life.He was saying to himself that he needed sympathetic
companionship, the companionship of a woman, of course.Social
invitations had begun to come to him now that he was alone and that
his financial connections were so obviously restored.He had made his
appearance, accompanied only by a Japanese valet, at several country
houses, the best sign that he was once more a single man.No reference
was made by any one to the past.Gerald's note he decided that he ought to go and
see her.For months preceding his
separation from Jennie he had not gone near her.Even now he waited
until time brought a 'phoned invitation to dinner.Gerald was at her best as a hostess at her perfectly appointed
dinner-table.Alboni, the pianist, was there on this occasion,
together with Adam Rascavage, the sculptor, a visiting scientist from
England, Sir Nelson Keyes, and, curiously enough, Mr.Berry
Dodge, whom Lester had not met socially in several years.Gerald
and Lester exchanged the joyful greetings of those who understand each
other thoroughly and are happy in each other's company."Aren't you
ashamed of yourself, sir," she said to him when he made his
appearance, "to treat me so indifferently?You are going to be
punished for this."I
suppose something like ninety stripes will serve me about right."What is it they do to evil-doers in Siam?""Boil them in oil, I suppose.""Well, anyhow, that's more like."Be sure and tell me when you decide," he laughed, and passed on to
be presented to distinguished strangers by Mrs.Lester was always at his ease
intellectually, and this mental atmosphere revived him.Presently he
turned to greet Berry Dodge, who was standing at his elbow."We
haven't seen you in--oh, when?Dodge is waiting to have a
word with you."Lester noticed the change in Dodge's attitude."Some time, that's sure," he replied easily."I'm living at the
Auditorium.""I was asking after you the other day.We were thinking of running up into Canada for some
hunting.He had seen Lester's election as a
director of the C. H.& D. Obviously he was coming back into the
world.But dinner was announced and Lester sat at Mrs."Aren't you coming to pay me a dinner call some afternoon after
this?"Gerald confidentially when the conversation was
brisk at the other end of the table."I am, indeed," he replied, "and shortly.Seriously, I've been
wanting to look you up.He felt as if he must talk with her; he
was feeling bored and lonely; his long home life with Jennie had made
hotel life objectionable.He felt as though he must find a
sympathetic, intelligent ear, and where better than here?Letty was
all ears for his troubles.She would have pillowed his solid head upon
her breast in a moment if that had been possible."Well," he said, when the usual fencing preliminaries were over,
"what will you have me say in explanation?""I'm not so sure," he replied gravely."And I can't say that I'm
feeling any too joyous about the matter as a whole.""I knew how it would be with you.I can see you wading through this mentally, Lester.I have been
watching you, every step of the way, wishing you peace of mind.These
things are always so difficult, but don't you know I am still sure
it's for the best.You couldn't afford to sink back into a mere shell-fish life.You
are not organized temperamentally for that any more than I am.You may
regret what you are doing now, but you would have regretted the other
thing quite as much and more.You couldn't work your life out that
way--now, could you?""I don't know about that, Letty.I've wanted to
come and see you for a long time, but I didn't think that I ought to.The fight was outside--you know what I mean.""Yes, indeed, I do," she said soothingly.I don't know whether
this financial business binds me sufficiently or not.I'll be frank
and tell you that I can't say I love her entirely; but I'm sorry, and
that's something.""She's comfortably provided for, of course," she commented rather
than inquired.She's retiring by nature and doesn't care for show.I've taken a cottage for her at Sandwood, a little place north of here
on the lake; and there's plenty of money in trust, but, of course, she
knows she can live anywhere she pleases.""I understand exactly how she feels, Lester.She is going to suffer very keenly for a while--we all do when we
have to give up the thing we love.But we can get over it, and we do.It will go hard at first, but after a
while she will see how it is, and she won't feel any the worse toward
you.""Jennie will never reproach me, I know that," he replied."I'm the
one who will do the reproaching.The trouble is with my particular turn of mind.I can't tell, for the
life of me, how much of this disturbing feeling of mine is
habit--the condition that I'm accustomed to--and how much is
sympathy.I sometimes think I'm the the most pointless individual in
the world.You're lonely living where you are, aren't you?""Why not come and spend a few days down at West Baden?"I could come Thursday, for a few days."We can walk and talk things out
down there.She came toward him, trailing a lavender lounging robe."You're
such a solemn philosopher, sir," she observed comfortably, "working
through all the ramifications of things."I can't help it," he replied."Well, one thing I know--" and she tweaked his ear gently."You're not going to make another mistake through sympathy if I can
help it," she said daringly."You're going to stay disentangled long
enough to give yourself a chance to think out what you want to do.And I wish for one thing you'd take over the management of my
affairs.You could advise me so much better than my lawyer."He arose and walked to the window, turning to look back at her
solemnly."I know what you want," he said doggedly.She
looked at him pleadingly, defiantly."You don't know what you're doing," he grumbled; but he kept on
looking at her; she stood there, attractive as a woman of her age
could be, wise, considerate, full of friendship and affection."You ought not to want to marry me.It won't be
worth anything in the long run.""It will be worth something to me," she insisted.Finally he drew her to him, and
put his arms about her waist.he said; "I'm not worth
it."No, I'll not," she replied.I don't care
what you think you are worth.""If you keep on I venture to say you'll have me," he returned."Oh," she exclaimed, and hid her hot face against his breast."This is bad business," he thought, even as he held her within the
circle of his arms."It isn't what I ought to be doing."Still he held her, and now when she offered her lips coaxingly he
kissed her again and again.CHAPTER LVI


It is difficult to say whether Lester might not have returned to
Jennie after all but for certain influential factors.After a time,
with his control of his portion of the estate firmly settled in his
hands and the storm of original feeling forgotten, he was well aware
that diplomacy--if he ignored his natural tendency to fulfil even
implied obligations--could readily bring about an arrangement
whereby he and Jennie could be together.But he was haunted by the
sense of what might be called an important social opportunity in the
form of Mrs.He was compelled to set over against his natural
tendency toward Jennie a consciousness of what he was ignoring in the
personality and fortunes of her rival, who was one of the most
significant and interesting figures on the social horizon.For think
as he would, these two women were now persistently opposed in his
consciousness.The one polished, sympathetic,
philosophic--schooled in all the niceties of polite society, and
with the means to gratify her every wish; the other natural,
sympathetic, emotional, with no schooling in the ways of polite
society, but with a feeling for the beauty of life and the lovely
things in human relationship which made her beyond any question an
exceptional woman.Her criticism
of Lester's relationship with Jennie was not that she was not worth
while, but that conditions made it impolitic.On the other hand, union
with her was an ideal climax for his social aspirations.He would be as happy with her as he would
be with Jennie--almost--and he would have the satisfaction
of knowing that this Western social and financial world held no more
significant figure than himself.It was not wise to delay either this
latter excellent solution of his material problems, and after thinking
it over long and seriously he finally concluded that he would not.He
had already done Jennie the irreparable wrong of leaving her.What
difference did it make if he did this also?She was possessed of
everything she could possibly want outside of himself.She had herself
deemed it advisable for him to leave.By such figments of the brain,
in the face of unsettled and disturbing conditions, he was becoming
used to the idea of a new alliance.The thing which prevented an eventual resumption of relationship in
some form with Jennie was the constant presence of Mrs.Circumstances conspired to make her the logical solution of his mental
quandary at this time.Alone he could do nothing save to make visits
here and there, and he did not care to do that.He was too indifferent
mentally to gather about him as a bachelor that atmosphere which he
enjoyed and which a woman like Mrs.Their home then, wherever it
was, would be full of clever people.He would need to do little save
to appear and enjoy it.She understood quite as well as any one how he
liked to live.She enjoyed to meet the people he enjoyed meeting.There were so many things they could do together nicely.He visited
West Baden at the same time she did, as she suggested.He gave himself
over to her in Chicago for dinners, parties, drives.Her house was
quite as much his own as hers--she made him feel so.She talked
to him about her affairs, showing him exactly how they stood and why
she wished him to intervene in this and that matter.She did not wish
him to be much alone.She did not want him to think or regret.She
came to represent to him comfort, forgetfulness, rest from care.With
the others he visited at her house occasionally, and it gradually
became rumored about that he would marry her.Because of the fact that
there had been so much discussion of his previous relationship, Letty
decided that if ever this occurred it should be a quiet affair.She
wanted a simple explanation in the papers of how it had come about,
and then afterward, when things were normal again and gossip had
subsided, she would enter on a dazzling social display for his
sake."Why not let us get married in April and go abroad for the summer?"she asked once, after they had reached a silent understanding that
marriage would eventually follow.Then we can come
back in the fall, and take a house on the drive."Lester had been away from Jennie so long now that the first severe
wave of self-reproach had passed.He was still doubtful, but he
preferred to stifle his misgivings."Very well," he replied, almost
jokingly."Only don't let there be any fuss about it."she exclaimed, looking over at
him; they had been spending the evening together quietly reading and
chatting."I've thought about it a long while," he replied.She came over to him and sat on his knee, putting her arms upon his
shoulders."I can scarcely believe you said that," she said, looking at him
curiously.But my, what a
trousseau I will prepare!"He smiled a little constrainedly as she tousled his head; there was
a missing note somewhere in this gamut of happiness; perhaps it was
because he was getting old.CHAPTER LVII


In the meantime Jennie was going her way, settling herself in the
markedly different world in which henceforth she was to move.It
seemed a terrible thing at first--this life without Lester.Despite her own strong individuality, her ways had become so involved
with his that there seemed to be no possibility of disentangling them.Constantly she was with him in thought and action, just as though they
had never separated.In the mornings when she woke it was with
the sense that he must be beside her.At night as if she could not go
to bed alone.He would come after a while surely--ah, no, of
course he would not come.Again there were so many little trying things to adjust, for a
change of this nature is too radical to be passed over lightly.The
explanation she had to make to Vesta was of all the most important.This little girl, who was old enough now to see and think for herself,
was not without her surmises and misgivings.Vesta recalled that her
mother had been accused of not being married to her father when she
was born.She had seen the article about Jennie and Lester in the
Sunday paper at the time it had appeared--it had been shown to
her at school--but she had had sense enough to say nothing about
it, feeling somehow that Jennie would not like it.Lester's
disappearance was a complete surprise; but she had learned in the last
two or three years that her mother was very sensitive, and that she
could hurt her in unexpected ways.Jennie was finally compelled to
tell Vesta that Lester's fortune had been dependent on his leaving
her, solely because she was not of his station.Vesta listened soberly
and half suspected the truth.She felt terribly sorry for her mother,
and, because of Jennie's obvious distress, she was trebly gay and
courageous.She refused outright the suggestion of going to a
boarding-school and kept as close to her mother as she could.She
found interesting books to read with her, insisted that they go to see
plays together, played to her on the piano, and asked for her mother's
criticisms on her drawing and modeling.She found a few friends in the
excellent Sand wood school, and brought them home of an evening to add
lightness and gaiety to the cottage life.Jennie, through her growing
appreciation of Vesta's fine character, became more and more drawn
toward her.Lester was gone, but at least she had Vesta.That prop
would probably sustain her in the face of a waning existence.There was also her history to account for to the residents of
Sandwood.In many cases where one is content to lead a secluded life
it is not necessary to say much of one's past, but as a rule something
must be said.People have the habit of inquiring--if they are no
more than butchers and bakers.By degrees one must account for this
and that fact, and it was so here.She could not say that her husband
was dead.She had to say that she had left
him--to give the impression that it would be she, if any one, who
would permit him to return.This put her in an interesting and
sympathetic light in the neighborhood.It was the most sensible thing
to do.She then settled down to a quiet routine of existence, waiting
what denouement to her life she could not guess.Sandwood life was not without its charms for a lover of nature, and
this, with the devotion of Vesta, offered some slight solace.There
was the beauty of the lake, which, with its passing boats, was a
never-ending source of joy, and there were many charming drives in the
surrounding country.Jennie had her own horse and carryall--one
of the horses of the pair they had used in Hyde Park.Other household
pets appeared in due course of time, including a collie, that Vesta
named Rats; she had brought him from Chicago as a puppy, and he had
grown to be a sterling watch-dog, sensible and affectionate.There was
also a cat, Jimmy Woods, so called after a boy Vesta knew, and to whom
she insisted the cat bore a marked resemblance.There was a singing
thrush, guarded carefully against a roving desire for bird-food on the
part of Jimmy Woods, and a jar of goldfish.So this little household
drifted along quietly and dreamily indeed, but always with the
undercurrent of feeling which ran so still because it was so deep.There was no word from Lester for the first few weeks following his
departure; he was too busy following up the threads of his new
commercial connections and too considerate to wish to keep Jennie in a
state of mental turmoil over communications which, under the present
circumstances, could mean nothing.He preferred to let matters rest
for the time being; then a little later he would write her sanely and
calmly of how things were going.He did this after the silence of a
month, saying that he had been pretty well pressed by commercial
affairs, that he had been in and out of the city frequently (which was
the truth), and that he would probably be away from Chicago a large
part of the time in the future.He inquired after Vesta and the
condition of affairs generally at Sandwood."I may get up there one of
these days," he suggested, but he really did not mean to come, and
Jennie knew that he did not.Another month passed, and then there was a second letter from him,
not so long as the first one.Jennie had written him frankly and
fully, telling him just how things stood with her.She concealed
entirely her own feelings in the matter, saying that she liked the
life very much, and that she was glad to be at Sand wood.She
expressed the hope that now everything was coming out for the best for
him, and tried to show him that she was really glad matters had been
settled."You mustn't think of me as being unhappy," she said in one
place, "for I'm not.I am sure it ought to be just as it is, and I
wouldn't be happy if it were any other way.Lay out your life so as to
give yourself the greatest happiness, Lester," she added.Whatever you do will be just right for me.Gerald in mind, and he suspected as much, but he felt that her
generosity must be tinged greatly with self-sacrifice and secret
unhappiness.It was the one thing which made him hesitate about taking
that final step.The written word and the hidden thought--how they conflict!After six months the correspondence was more or less perfunctory on
his part, and at eight it had ceased temporarily.One morning, as she was glancing over the daily paper, she saw
among the society notes the following item:

The engagement of Mrs.Malcolm Gerald, of 4044 Drexel Boulevard,
to Lester Kane, second son of the late Archibald Kane, of Cincinnati,
was formally announced at a party given by the prospective bride on
Tuesday to a circle of her immediate friends.For a few minutes she sat perfectly
still, looking straight ahead of her.She had known that it must
come, and yet--and yet she had always hoped that it would not.Had not she
herself suggested this very thing in a roundabout way?The idea was
objectionable to her.And yet he had set aside a goodly sum to be hers
absolutely.In the hands of a trust company in La Salle Street were
railway certificates aggregating seventy-five thousand dollars, which
yielded four thousand five hundred annually, the income being paid to
her direct.Jennie felt hurt through and through by this denouement, and yet as
she sat there she realized that it was foolish to be angry.Life was
always doing this sort of a thing to her.If she went out in the world and earned her own living
what difference would it make to him?Here she was walled in this little place, leading an
obscure existence, and there was he out in the great world enjoying
life in its fullest and freest sense.Her eyes indeed were dry, but her very soul seemed to be torn in
pieces within her.She rose carefully, hid the newspaper at the bottom
of a trunk, and turned the key upon it.CHAPTER LVIII


Now that his engagement to Mrs.Gerald was an accomplished, fact,
Lester found no particular difficulty in reconciling himself to the
new order of things; undoubtedly it was all for the best.He was sorry
for Jennie--very sorry.Gerald; but there was a
practical unguent to her grief in the thought that it was best for
both Lester and the girl.And
Jennie would eventually realize that she had done a wise and kindly
thing; she would be glad in the consciousness that she had acted so
unselfishly.Gerald, because of her indifference to the
late Malcolm Gerald, and because she was realizing the dreams of her
youth in getting Lester at last--even though a little
late--she was intensely happy.She could think of nothing finer
than this daily life with him--the places they would go, the
things they would see.Lester Kane
the following winter was going to be something worth remembering.And
as for Japan--that was almost too good to be true.Lester wrote to Jennie of his coming marriage to Mrs.He
said that he had no explanation to make.It wouldn't be worth anything
if he did make it.He
thought he ought to let her (Jennie) know.He
wanted her always to feel that he had her real interests at heart.He
would do anything in his power to make life as pleasant and agreeable
for her as possible.And would she
remember him affectionately to Vesta?She ought to be sent to a
finishing school.She knew that Lester had
been drawn to Mrs.Gerald from the time he met her at the Carlton in
London.She was glad to write and tell him
so, explaining that she had seen the announcement in the papers.Lester read her letter thoughtfully; there was more between the lines
than the written words conveyed.Her fortitude was a charm to him even
in this hour.In spite of all he had done and what he was now going to
do, he realized that he still cared for Jennie in a way.She was a
noble and a charming woman.If everything else had been all right he
would not be going to marry Mrs.The ceremony was performed on April fifteenth, at the residence of
Mrs.Gerald, a Roman Catholic priest officiating.Lester was a poor
example of the faith he occasionally professed.He was an agnostic,
but because he had been reared in the church he felt that he might as
well be married in it.Some fifty guests, intimate friends, had been
invited.There were
jubilant congratulations and showers of rice and confetti.While the
guests were still eating and drinking Lester and Letty managed to
escape by a side entrance into a closed carriage, and were off.Fifteen minutes later there was pursuit pell-mell on the part of the
guests to the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific depot; but by that time
the happy couple were in their private car, and the arrival of the
rice throwers made no difference.More champagne was opened; then the
starting of the train ended all excitement, and the newly wedded pair
were at last safely off."Well, now you have me," said Lester, cheerfully pulling Letty down
beside him into a seat, "what of it?""This of it," she exclaimed, and hugged him close, kissing him
fervently.In four days they were in San Francisco, and two days later
on board a fast steamship bound for the land of the Mikado.In the meanwhile Jennie was left to brood.The original
announcement in the newspapers had said that he was to be married in
April, and she had kept close watch for additional information.Finally she learned that the wedding would take place on April
fifteenth at the residence of the prospective bride, the hour being
high noon.In spite of her feeling of resignation, Jennie followed it
all hopelessly, like a child, hungry and forlorn, looking into a
lighted window at Christmas time.On the day of the wedding she waited miserably for twelve o'clock
to strike; it seemed as though she were really present--and
looking on.She could see in her mind's eye the handsome residence,
the carriages, the guests, the feast, the merriment, the
ceremony--all.Telepathically and psychologically she received
impressions of the private car and of the joyous journey they were
going to take.The papers had stated that they would spend their
honeymoon in Japan.She could see her now--the new Mrs.Kane that ever was, lying in his arms.There was a solid lump in
her throat as she thought of this.She sighed to herself,
and clasped her hands forcefully; but it did no good.She was just as
miserable as before.When the day was over she was actually relieved; anyway, the deed
was done and nothing could change it.Vesta was sympathetically aware
of what was happening, but kept silent.She too had seen the report in
the newspaper.When the first and second day after had passed Jennie
was much calmer mentally, for now she was face to face with the
inevitable.But it was weeks before the sharp pain dulled to the old
familiar ache.Then there were months before they would be back again,
though, of course, that made no difference now.Only Japan seemed so
far off, and somehow she had liked the thought that Lester was near
her--somewhere in the city.The spring and summer passed, and now it was early in October.One
chilly day Vesta came home from school complaining of a headache.When
Jennie had given her hot milk--a favorite remedy of her
mother's--and had advised a cold towel for the back of her head,
Vesta went to her room and lay down.The following morning she had a
slight fever.This lingered while the local physician, Dr.Emory,
treated her tentatively, suspecting that it might be typhoid, of which
there were several cases in the village.This doctor told Jennie that
Vesta was probably strong enough constitutionally to shake it off, but
it might be that she would have a severe siege.Mistrusting her own
skill in so delicate a situation, Jennie sent to Chicago for a trained
nurse, and then began a period of watchfulness which was a combination
of fear, longing, hope, and courage.Now there could be no doubt; the disease was typhoid.Jennie
hesitated about communicating with Lester, who was supposed to be in
New York; the papers had said that he intended to spend the winter
there.But when the doctor, after watching the case for a week,
pronounced it severe, she thought she ought to write anyhow, for no
one could tell what would happen.Lester had been so fond of Vesta.The letter sent to him did not reach him, for at the time it
arrived he was on his way to the West Indies.Jennie was compelled to
watch alone by Vesta's sick-bed, for although sympathetic neighbors,
realizing the pathos of the situation were attentive, they could not
supply the spiritual consolation which only those who truly love us
can give.There was a period when Vesta appeared to be rallying, and
both the physician and the nurse were hopeful; but afterward she
became weaker.Emory that her heart and kidneys had
become affected.There came a time when the fact had to be faced that death was
imminent.The doctor's face was grave, the nurse was non-committal in
her opinion.Jennie hovered about, praying the only prayer that is
prayer--the fervent desire of her heart concentrated on the one
issue--that Vesta should get well.The child had come so close to
her during the last few years!She was
beginning to realize clearly what her life had been.And Jennie,
through her, had grown to a broad understanding of responsibility.She
knew now what it meant to be a good mother and to have children.If
Lester had not objected to it, and she had been truly married, she
would have been glad to have others.Again, she had always felt that
she owed Vesta so much--at least a long and happy life to make up
to her for the ignominy of her birth and rearing.Jennie had been so
happy during the past few years to see Vesta growing into beautiful,
graceful, intelligent womanhood.Emory
finally sent to Chicago for a physician friend of his, who came to
consider the case with him.He was an old man, grave, sympathetic,
understanding."The treatment has been correct," he
said."Her system does not appear to be strong enough to endure the
strain.Some physiques are more susceptible to this malady than
others."It was agreed that if within three days a change for the
better did not come the end was close at hand.No one can conceive the strain to which Jennie's spirit was
subjected by this intelligence, for it was deemed best that she should
know.She hovered about white-faced--feeling intensely, but
scarcely thinking.She seemed to vibrate consciously with Vesta's
altering states.If there was the least improvement she felt it
physically.If there was a decline her barometric temperament
registered the fact.Davis, a fine, motherly soul of fifty, stout and
sympathetic, who lived four doors from Jennie, and who understood
quite well how she was feeling.She had co-operated with the nurse and
doctor from the start to keep Jennie's mental state as nearly normal
as possible."Now, you just go to your room and lie down, Mrs.Kane," she would
say to Jennie when she found her watching helplessly at the bedside or
wandering to and fro, wondering what to do.Lord bless you, don't you
think I know?I've been the mother of seven and lost three.Jennie put her head on her big, warm shoulder one
day and cried.And she led her
to her sleeping-room.She came back after a few minutes
unrested and unrefreshed.Finally one midnight, when the nurse had
persuaded her that all would be well until morning anyhow, there came
a hurried stirring in the sick-room.Jennie was lying down for a few
minutes on her bed in the adjoining room.Davis had come in, and she and the nurse were conferring as to Vesta's
condition--standing close beside her.She came up and looked at her daughter keenly.Vesta's pale, waxen face told the story.She was breathing faintly,
her eyes closed."She's very weak," whispered the nurse.The moments passed, and after a time the clock in the hall struck
one.Miss Murfree, the nurse, moved to the medicine-table several
times, wetting a soft piece of cotton cloth with alcohol and bathing
Vesta's lips.At the striking of the half-hour there was a stir of the
weak body--a profound sigh."There, there, you poor dear," she
whispered when she began to shake.Jennie sank on her knees beside the bed and caressed Vesta's still
warm hand."Oh no, Vesta," she pleaded."There, dear, come now," soothed the voice of Mrs."Can't
you leave it all in God's hands?Can't you believe that everything is
for the best?"Jennie felt as if the earth had fallen.There
was no light anywhere in the immense darkness of her existence.CHAPTER LIX


This added blow from inconsiderate fortune was quite enough to
throw Jennie back into that state of hyper-melancholia from which she
had been drawn with difficulty during the few years of comfort and
affection which she had enjoyed with Lester in Hyde Park.It was
really weeks before she could realize that Vesta was gone.The
emaciated figure which she saw for a day or two after the end did not
seem like Vesta.Where was the joy and lightness, the quickness of
motion, the subtle radiance of health?Only this pale,
lily-hued shell--and silence.Jennie had no tears to shed; only a
deep, insistent pain to feel.If only some counselor of eternal wisdom
could have whispered to her that obvious and convincing
truth--there are no dead.Davis, and some others among the
neighbors were most sympathetic and considerate.Davis sent a
telegram to Lester saying that Vesta was dead, but, being absent,
there was no response.The house was looked after with scrupulous care
by others, for Jennie was incapable of attending to it herself.She
walked about looking at things which Vesta had owned or
liked--things which Lester or she had given her--sighing
over the fact that Vesta would not need or use them any more.She gave
instructions that the body should be taken to Chicago and buried in
the Cemetery of the Redeemer, for Lester, at the time of Gerhardt's
death, had purchased a small plot of ground there.She also expressed
her wish that the minister of the little Lutheran church in Cottage
Grove Avenue, where Gerhardt had attended, should be requested to say
a few words at the grave.There were the usual preliminary services at
the house.The local Methodist minister read a portion of the first
epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians, and a body of Vesta's classmates
sang "Nearer My God to Thee."There were flowers, a white coffin, a
world of sympathetic expressions, and then Vesta was taken away.The
coffin was properly incased for transportation, put on the train, and
finally delivered at the Lutheran cemetery in Chicago.She was dazed, almost to the point
of insensibility.Five of her neighborhood friends, at the
solicitation of Mrs.At the
grave-side when the body was finally lowered she looked at it, one
might have thought indifferently, for she was numb from suffering.She
returned to Sandwood after it was all over, saying that she would not
stay long.She wanted to come back to Chicago, where she could be near
Vesta and Gerhardt.After the funeral Jennie tried to think of her future.She fixed
her mind on the need of doing something, even though she did not need
to.She thought that she might like to try nursing, and could start at
once to obtain the training which was required.He was unmarried, and perhaps he might be willing to come and
live with her.Only she did not know where he was, and Bass was also
in ignorance of his whereabouts.She finally concluded that she would
try to get work in a store.She
could not live alone here, and she could not have her neighbors
sympathetically worrying over what was to become of her.Miserable as
she was, she would be less miserable stopping in a hotel in Chicago,
and looking for something to do, or living in a cottage somewhere near
the Cemetery of the Redeemer.It also occurred to her that she might
adopt a homeless child.There were a number of orphan asylums in the
city.Some three weeks after Vesta's death Lester returned to Chicago
with his wife, and discovered the first letter, the telegram, and an
additional note telling him that Vesta was dead.He was truly grieved,
for his affection for the girl had been real.He was very sorry for
Jennie, and he told his wife that he would have to go out and see her.Perhaps
he could suggest something which would help her.He took the train to
Sandwood, but Jennie had gone to the Hotel Tremont in Chicago.He went
there, but Jennie had gone to her daughter's grave; later he called
again and found her in.When the boy presented his card she suffered
an upwelling of feeling--a wave that was more intense than that
with which she had received him in the olden days, for now her need of
him was greater.Lester, in spite of the glamor of his new affection and the
restoration of his wealth, power, and dignities, had had time to think
deeply of what he had done.His original feeling of doubt and
dissatisfaction with himself had never wholly quieted.It did not ease
him any to know that he had left Jennie comfortably fixed, for it was
always so plain to him that money was not the point at issue with her.Without it she was like a rudderless
boat on an endless sea, and he knew it.She needed him, and he was
ashamed to think that his charity had not outweighed his sense of
self-preservation and his desire for material advantage.To-day as the
elevator carried him up to her room he was really sorry, though he
knew now that no act of his could make things right.He had been to
blame from the very beginning, first for taking her, then for failing
to stick by a bad bargain.The best
thing he could do was to be fair, to counsel with her, to give her the
best of his sympathy and advice."Hello, Jennie," he said familiarly as she opened the door to him
in her hotel room, his glance taking in the ravages which death and
suffering had wrought.She was thinner, her face quite drawn and
colorless, her eyes larger by contrast."I'm awfully sorry about
Vesta," he said a little awkwardly."I never dreamed anything like
that could happen."It was the first word of comfort which had meant anything to her
since Vesta died--since Lester had left her, in fact.It touched
her that he had come to sympathize; for the moment she could not
speak.Tears welled over her eyelids and down upon her cheeks."Don't cry, Jennie," he said, putting his arm around her and
holding her head to his shoulder.I've been sorry for a
good many things that can't be helped now."Beside papa," she said, sobbing."Too bad," he murmured, and held her in silence.She finally gained
control of herself sufficiently to step away from him; then wiping her
eyes with her handkerchief, she asked him to sit down."I'm so sorry," he went on, "that this should have happened while I
was away.I would have been with you if I had been here.I suppose you
won't want to live out at Sand wood now?""I can't, Lester," she replied.I didn't want to be a bother to those people
out there.I thought I'd get a little house somewhere and adopt a baby
maybe, or get something to do."That isn't a bad idea," he said, "that of adopting a baby.It
would be a lot of company for you.You know how to go about getting
one?""You just ask at one of these asylums, don't you?""I think there's something more than that," he replied
thoughtfully."There are some formalities--I don't know what they
are.They try to keep control of the child in some way.You had better
consult with Watson and get him to help you.Pick out your baby, and
then let him do the rest.Lester saw that she needed companionship badly."He's in Rochester, but he couldn't come.Bass said he was
married," she added."There isn't any other member of the family you could persuade to
come and live with you?""I might get William, but I don't know where he is.""Why not try that new section west of Jackson Park," he suggested,
"if you want a house here in Chicago?I see some nice cottages out
that way.Just rent until you see how well you're
satisfied."Jennie thought this good advice because it came from Lester.It was
good of him to take this much interest in her affairs.She wasn't
entirely separated from him after all.She asked
him how his wife was, whether he had had a pleasant trip, whether he
was going to stay in Chicago.All the while he was thinking that he
had treated her badly.He went to the window and looked down into
Dearborn Street, the world of traffic below holding his attention.The
great mass of trucks and vehicles, the counter streams of hurrying
pedestrians, seemed like a puzzle.It was
growing dusk, and lights were springing up here and there."I want to tell you something, Jennie," said Lester, finally
rousing himself from his fit of abstraction."I may seem peculiar to
you, after all that has happened, but I still care for you--in my
way.I've thought of you right along since I left.I thought it good
business to leave you--the way things were.I thought I liked
Letty well enough to marry her.From one point of view it still seems
best, but I'm not so much happier.I was just as happy with you as I
ever will be.It isn't myself that's important in this transaction
apparently; the individual doesn't count much in the situation.I
don't know whether you see what I'm driving at, but all of us are more
or less pawns.We're moved about like chessmen by circumstances over
which we have no control.""After all, life is more or less of a farce," he went on a little
bitterly.The best we can do is to hold our
personality intact.It doesn't appear that integrity has much to do
with it."Jennie did not quite grasp what he was talking about, but she knew
it meant that he was not entirely satisfied with himself and was sorry
for her."Don't worry over me, Lester," she consoled."I'm all right; I'll
get along.It did seem terrible to me for a while--getting used
to being alone."I want you to feel that my attitude hasn't changed," he continued
eagerly.Mrs.--Letty
understands that.When you get settled I'll
come in and see how you're fixed.I'll come around here again in a few
days.You understand how I feel, don't you?"He took her hand, turning it sympathetically in his own."Don't
worry," he said."I don't want you to do that.You're still Jennie to me, if you don't mind.I'm pretty bad, but I'm
not all bad."You probably are happy since--"

"Now, Jennie," he interrupted; then he pressed affectionately her
hand, her arm, her shoulder."Want to kiss me for old times' sake?"She put her hands over his shoulders, looked long into his eyes,
then kissed him.Jennie saw his agitation, and tried hard to speak."You'd better go now," she said firmly.He went away, and yet he knew that he wanted above all things to
remain; she was still the one woman in the world for him.And Jennie
felt comforted even though the separation still existed in all its
finality.She did not endeavor to explain or adjust the moral and
ethical entanglements of the situation.She was not, like so many,
endeavoring to put the ocean into a tea-cup, or to tie up the shifting
universe in a mess of strings called law.Lester still cared for her a
little.She had hoped once
that he might want her only.Since he did not, was his affection worth
nothing?She could not think, she could not feel that.CHAPTER LX


The drift of events for a period of five years carried Lester and
Jennie still farther apart; they settled naturally into their
respective spheres, without the renewal of the old time relationship
which their several meetings at the Tremont at first seemed to
foreshadow.Lester was in the thick of social and commercial affairs;
he walked in paths to which Jennie's retiring soul had never aspired.Jennie's own existence was quiet and uneventful.There was a simple
cottage in a very respectable but not showy neighborhood near Jackson
Park, on the South Side, where she lived in retirement with a little
foster-child--a chestnut-haired girl taken from the Western Home
for the Friendless--as her sole companion.J. G. Stover, for she had deemed it best to abandon the name of
Kane.Lester Kane when resident in Chicago were the
occupants of a handsome mansion on the Lake Shore Drive, where
parties, balls, receptions, dinners were given in rapid and at times
almost pyrotechnic succession.Lester, however, had become in his way a lover of a peaceful and
well-entertained existence.He had cut from his list of acquaintances
and associates a number of people who had been a little doubtful or
overfamiliar or indifferent or talkative during a certain period which
to him was a memory merely.He was a director, and in several cases
the chairman of a board of directors, in nine of the most important
financial and commercial organizations of the West--The United
Traction Company of Cincinnati, The Western Crucible Company, The
United Carriage Company, The Second National Bank of Chicago, the
First National Bank of Cincinnati, and several others of equal
importance.He was never a personal factor in the affairs of The
United Carriage Company, preferring to be represented by
counsel--Mr.Dwight L. Watson, but he took a keen interest in its
affairs.He had not seen his brother Robert to speak to him in seven
years.He had not seen Imogene, who lived in Chicago, in three.Louise, Amy, their husbands, and some of their closest acquaintances
were practically strangers.The firm of Knight, Keatley & O'Brien
had nothing whatever to do with his affairs.The truth was that Lester, in addition to becoming a little
phlegmatic, was becoming decidedly critical in his outlook on life.He
could not make out what it was all about.In distant ages a queer
thing had come to pass.There had started on its way in the form of
evolution a minute cellular organism which had apparently reproduced
itself by division, had early learned to combine itself with others,
to organize itself into bodies, strange forms of fish, animals, and
birds, and had finally learned to organize itself into man.Man, on
his part, composed as he was of self-organizing cells, was pushing
himself forward into comfort and different aspects of existence by
means of union and organization with other men.Here he was endowed with a peculiar brain and a certain amount of
talent, and he had inherited a certain amount of wealth which he now
scarcely believed he deserved, only luck had favored him.But he could
not see that any one else might be said to deserve this wealth any
more than himself, seeing that his use of it was as conservative and
constructive and practical as the next one's.He might have been born
poor, in which case he would have been as well satisfied as the next
one--not more so.Why should he complain, why worry, why
speculate?--the world was going steadily forward of its own
volition, whether he would or no.And was there any need
for him to disturb himself about it?He fancied at
times that it might as well never have been started at all."The one
divine, far-off event" of the poet did not appeal to him as having any
basis in fact.Lester Kane was of very much the same opinion.Jennie, living on the South Side with her adopted child, Rose
Perpetua, was of no fixed conclusion as to the meaning of life.She
had not the incisive reasoning capacity of either Mr.She had seen a great deal, suffered a great deal, and had read
some in a desultory way.Her mind had never grasped the nature and
character of specialized knowledge.History, physics, chemistry,
botany, geology, and sociology were not fixed departments in her brain
as they were in Lester's and Letty's.Instead there was the feeling
that the world moved in some strange, unstable way.Apparently no one
knew clearly what it was all about.Some
believed that the world had been made six thousand years before; some
that it was millions of years old.Was it all blind chance, or was
there some guiding intelligence--a God?Almost in spite of
herself she felt there must be something--a higher power which
produced all the beautiful things--the flowers, the stars, the
trees, the grass.If at times life seemed
cruel, yet this beauty still persisted.The thought comforted her; she
fed upon it in her hours of secret loneliness.It has been said that Jennie was naturally of an industrious turn.She liked to be employed, though she thought constantly as she worked.She was of matronly proportions in these days--not disagreeably
large, but full bodied, shapely, and smooth-faced in spite of her
cares.Her hair was still of a rich
brown, but there were traces of gray in it.Her neighbors spoke of her
as sweet-tempered, kindly, and hospitable.They knew nothing of her
history, except that she had formerly resided in Sandwood, and before
that in Cleveland.She was very reticent as to her past.Jennie had fancied, because of her natural aptitude for taking care
of sick people, that she might get to be a trained nurse.But she was
obliged to abandon that idea, for she found that only young people
were wanted.She also thought that some charitable organization might
employ her, but she did not understand the new theory of charity which
was then coming into general acceptance and practice--namely,
only to help others to help themselves.She believed in giving, and
was not inclined to look too closely into the credentials of those who
asked for help; consequently her timid inquiry at one relief agency
after another met with indifference, if not unqualified rebuke.She
finally decided to adopt another child for Rose Perpetua's sake; she
succeeded in securing a boy, four years old, who was known as
Henry--Henry Stover.Her support was assured, for her income was
paid to her through a trust company.She had no desire for speculation
or for the devious ways of trade.The care of flowers, the nature of
children, the ordering of a home were more in her province.One of the interesting things in connection with this separation
once it had been firmly established related to Robert and Lester, for
these two since the reading of the will a number of years before had
never met.He had followed
his success since he had left Jennie with interest.Gerald with pleasure; he had always considered her an
ideal companion for his brother.He knew by many signs and tokens that
his brother, since the unfortunate termination of their father's
attitude and his own peculiar movements to gain control of the Kane
Company, did not like him.Still they had never been so far apart
mentally--certainly not in commercial judgment.Lester was
prosperous now.And after all, he had done his best to aid his brother to
come to his senses--and with the best intentions.There were
mutual interests they could share financially if they were friends.He
wondered from time to time if Lester would not be friendly with
him.Time passed, and then once, when he was in Chicago, he made the
friends with whom he was driving purposely turn into the North Shore
in order to see the splendid mansion which the Kanes occupied.He knew
its location from hearsay and description.When he saw it a touch of the old Kane home atmosphere came back to
him.Lester in revising the property after purchase had had a
conservatory built on one side not unlike the one at home in
Cincinnati.That same night he sat down and wrote Lester asking if he
would not like to dine with him at the Union Club.He was only in town
for a day or two, and he would like to see him again.There was some
feeling he knew, but there was a proposition he would like to talk to
him about.On the receipt of this letter Lester frowned and fell into a brown
study.He had never really been healed of the wound that his father
had given him.He had never been comfortable in his mind since Robert
had deserted him so summarily.He realized now that the stakes his
brother had been playing for were big.But, after all, he had been his
brother, and if he had been in Robert's place at the time, he would
not have done as he had done; at least he hoped not.Then he thought he would
write and say no.But a curious desire to see Robert again, to hear
what he had to say, to listen to the proposition he had to offer, came
over him; he decided to write yes.They might agree to let by-gones be by-gones, but
the damage had been done.Could a broken bowl be mended and called
whole?It might be called whole, but what of it?He wrote and intimated that he would come.On the Thursday in question Robert called up from the Auditorium to
remind him of the engagement.Lester listened curiously to the sound
of his voice."All right," he said, "I'll be with you."At noon he
went down-town, and there, within the exclusive precincts of the Union
Club, the two brothers met and looked at each other again.Robert was
thinner than when Lester had seen him last, and a little grayer.His
eyes were bright and steely, but there were crow's-feet on either
side.Lester was noticeably of
another type--solid, brusque, and indifferent.Men spoke of
Lester these days as a little hard.Robert's keen blue eyes did not
disturb him in the least--did not affect him in any way.He saw
his brother just as he was, for he had the larger philosophic and
interpretative insight; but Robert could not place Lester exactly.He
could not fathom just what had happened to him in these years.Lester
was stouter, not gray, for some reason, but sandy and ruddy, looking
like a man who was fairly well satisfied to take life as he found it.Lester looked at his brother with a keen, steady eye.The latter
shifted a little, for he was restless.He could see that there was no
loss of that mental force and courage which had always been
predominant characteristics in Lester's make-up."I thought I'd like to see you again, Lester," Robert remarked,
after they had clasped hands in the customary grip."It's been a long
time now--nearly eight years, hasn't it?"I don't
often go to bed with anything."We don't see much of Ralph and Berenice since they married, but
the others are around more or less.I suppose your wife is all right,"
he said hesitatingly.Lester eyed him without a change of expression.They drifted mentally for a few moments, while Lester inquired
after the business, and Amy, Louise, and Imogene.He admitted frankly
that he neither saw nor heard from them nowadays."The thing that I was thinking of in connection with you, Lester,"
said Robert finally, "is this matter of the Western Crucible Steel
Company.You haven't been sitting there as a director in person I
notice, but your attorney, Watson, has been acting for you.The management isn't right--we all know that.We need
a practical steel man at the head of it, if the thing is ever going to
pay properly.I have voted my stock with yours right along because the
propositions made by Watson have been right.He agrees with me that
things ought to be changed.Now I have a chance to buy seventy shares
held by Rossiter's widow.That with yours and mine would give us
control of the company.I would like to have you take them, though it
doesn't make a bit of difference so long as it's in the family.You
can put any one you please in for president, and we'll make the thing
come out right."Watson had told him
that Robert's interests were co-operating with him.Lester had long
suspected that Robert would like to make up.This was the olive
branch--the control of a property worth in the neighborhood of a
million and a half."That's very nice of you," said Lester solemnly."It's a rather
liberal thing to do."Well, to tell you the honest truth, Lester," replied Robert, "I
never did feel right about that will business.I never did feel right
about that secretary-treasurership and some other things that have
happened.I don't want to rake up the past--you smile at
that--but I can't help telling you how I feel.I've been pretty
ambitious in the past.I was pretty ambitious just about the time that
father died to get this United Carriage scheme under way, and I was
afraid you might not like it.I have thought since that I ought not to
have done it, but I did.I suppose you're not anxious to hear any more
about that old affair.This other thing though--"

"Might be handed out as a sort of compensation," put in Lester
quietly."Not exactly that, Lester--though it may have something of
that in it.I know these things don't matter very much to you now.I
know that the time to do things was years ago--not now.Still I
thought sincerely that you might be interested in this proposition.Frankly, I thought it might patch up
matters between us."Yes," said Lester, "we're brothers."He was thinking as he said this of the irony of the situation.How
much had this sense of brotherhood been worth in the past?Robert had
practically forced him into his present relationship, and while Jennie
had been really the only one to suffer, he could not help feeling
angry.It was true that Robert had not cut him out of his one-fourth
of his father's estate, but certainly he had not helped him to get it,
and now Robert was thinking that this offer of his might mend things.It hurt him--Lester--a little."I can't see it, Robert," he said finally and determinedly."I can
appreciate the motive that prompts you to make this offer.But I can't
see the wisdom of my taking it.We can make all the changes you suggest if you take
the stock.I'm perfectly
willing to talk with you from time to time.This
other thing is simply a sop with which to plaster an old wound.You
want my friendship and so far as I'm concerned you have that.I don't
hold any grudge against you.He admired Lester in
spite of all that he had done to him--in spite of all that Lester
was doing to him now."I don't know but what you're right, Lester," he admitted finally."I didn't make this offer in any petty spirit though.I wanted to
patch up this matter of feeling between us.I won't say anything more
about it.You're not coming down to Cincinnati soon, are you?""I don't expect to," replied Lester."If you do I'd like to have you come and stay with us."I'll be glad to," he said, without emotion.But he remembered that
in the days of Jennie it was different.They would never have receded
from their position regarding her."Well," he thought, "perhaps I
can't blame them."I'll have to leave you soon," he said, looking at his
watch."I ought to go, too," said Robert."Well, anyhow," he
added, as they walked toward the cloakroom, "we won't be absolute
strangers in the future, will we?""I'll see you from time to time."There was a sense of
unsatisfied obligation and some remorse in Robert's mind as he saw his
brother walking briskly away.Why was it that
there was so much feeling between them--had been even before
Jennie had appeared?Then he remembered his old thoughts about "snaky
deeds."That was what his brother lacked, and that only.He was not
crafty; not darkly cruel, hence.On his part Lester went away feeling a slight sense of opposition
to, but also of sympathy for, his brother.He was not so terribly
bad--not different from other men.What would he
have done if he had been in Robert's place?He could see now how it all came about--why he had
been made the victim, why his brother had been made the keeper of the
great fortune."It's the way the world runs," he thought.CHAPTER LXI


The days of man under the old dispensation, or, rather, according
to that supposedly biblical formula, which persists, are threescore
years and ten.It is so ingrained in the race-consciousness by
mouth-to-mouth utterance that it seems the profoundest of truths.As a
matter of fact, man, even under his mortal illusion, is organically
built to live five times the period of his maturity, and would do so
if he but knew that it is spirit which endures, that age is an
illusion, and that there is no death.Yet the race-thought, gained
from what dream of materialism we know not, persists, and the death of
man under the mathematical formula so fearfully accepted is daily
registered.Lester was one of those who believed in this formula.He thought he had, say, twenty years more at the utmost
to live--perhaps not so long.No complaint or resistance would issue from
him.Life, in most of its aspects, was a silly show anyhow.He admitted that it was mostly illusion--easily proved to be
so.That it might all be one he sometimes suspected.It was very much
like a dream in its composition truly--sometimes like a very bad
dream.All he had to sustain him in his acceptance of its reality from
hour to hour and day to day was apparent contact with this material
proposition and that--people, meetings of boards of directors,
individuals and organizations planning to do this and that, his wife's
social functions Letty loved him as a fine, grizzled example of a
philosopher.She admired, as Jennie had, his solid, determined,
phlegmatic attitude in the face of troubled circumstance.All the
winds of fortune or misfortune could not apparently excite or disturb
Lester.He refused to budge from his
beliefs and feelings, and usually had to be pushed away from them,
still believing, if he were gotten away at all.He refused to do
anything save as he always said, "Look the facts in the face" and
fight.He could be made to fight easily enough if imposed upon, but
only in a stubborn, resisting way.His plan was to resist every effort
to coerce him to the last ditch.If he had to let go in the end he
would when compelled, but his views as to the value of not letting go
were quite the same even when he had let go under compulsion.His views of living were still decidedly material, grounded in
creature comforts, and he had always insisted upon having the best of
everything.If the furnishings of his home became the least dingy he
was for having them torn out and sold and the house done over.If he
traveled, money must go ahead of him and smooth the way.He did not
want argument, useless talk, or silly palaver as he called it.Every
one must discuss interesting topics with him or not talk at all.She would chuck him under the chin
mornings, or shake his solid head between her hands, telling him he
was a brute, but a nice kind of a brute."Yes, yes," he would growl.You're a seraphic suggestion of
attenuated thought.""No; you hush," she would reply, for at times he could cut like a
knife without really meaning to be unkind.Then he would pet her a
little, for, in spite of her vigorous conception of life, he realized
that she was more or less dependent upon him.It was always so plain
to her that he could get along without her.For reasons of kindliness
he was trying to conceal this, to pretend the necessity of her
presence, but it was so obvious that he really could dispense with her
easily enough.It was something, in
so shifty and uncertain a world, to be near so fixed and determined a
quantity as this bear-man.It was like being close to a warmly glowing
lamp in the dark or a bright burning fire in the cold.Lester was not
afraid of anything.He felt that he knew how to live and to die.It was natural that a temperament of this kind should have its
solid, material manifestation at every point.Having his financial
affairs well in hand, most of his holding being shares of big
companies, where boards of solemn directors merely approved the
strenuous efforts of ambitious executives to "make good," he had
leisure for living.He and Letty were fond of visiting the various
American and European watering-places.He gambled a little, for he
found that there was considerable diversion in risking interesting
sums on the spin of a wheel or the fortuitous roll of a ball; and he
took more and more to drinking, not in the sense that a drunkard takes
to it, but as a high liver, socially, and with all his friends.He was
inclined to drink the rich drinks when he did not take straight
whiskey--champagne, sparkling Burgundy, the expensive and
effervescent white wines.When he drank he could drink a great deal,
and he ate in proportion.Nothing must be served but the
best--soup, fish, entree, roast, game, dessert--everything
that made up a showy dinner and he had long since determined that only
a high-priced chef was worth while.They had found an old cordon
bleu, Louis Berdot, who had served in the house of one of the
great dry goods princes, and this man he engaged.He cost Lester a
hundred dollars a week, but his reply to any question was that he only
had one life to live.The trouble with this attitude was that it adjusted nothing,
improved nothing, left everything to drift on toward an indefinite
end.If Lester had married Jennie and accepted the comparatively
meager income of ten thousand a year he would have maintained the same
attitude to the end.It would have led him to a stolid indifference to
the social world of which now necessarily he was a part.He would have
drifted on with a few mentally compatible cronies who would have
accepted him for what he was--a good fellow--and Jennie in
the end would not have been so much better off than she was now.One of the changes which was interesting was that the Kanes
transferred their residence to New York.Kane had become very
intimate with a group of clever women in the Eastern four hundred, or
nine hundred, and had been advised and urged to transfer the scene of
her activities to New York.She finally did so, leasing a house in
Seventy-eighth Street, near Madison Avenue.She installed a novelty
for her, a complete staff of liveried servants, after the English
fashion, and had the rooms of her house done in correlative periods.Lester smiled at her vanity and love of show."You talk about your democracy," he grunted one day."You have as
much democracy as I have religion, and that's none at all."I'm merely accepting the logic of the situation."Do you call a butler and doorman in
red velvet a part of the necessity of the occasion?""Maybe not the necessity exactly,
but the spirit surely.You're the first one to
insist on perfection--to quarrel if there is any flaw in the
order of things.""Oh, I don't mean that literally.But you demand
perfection--the exact spirit of the occasion, and you know
it.""Maybe I do, but what has that to do with your democracy?"I'm as democratic in spirit as
any woman.Only I see things as they are, and conform as much as
possible for comfort's sake, and so do you.Don't you throw rocks at
my glass house, Mister Master.Yours is so transparent I can see every
move you make inside.""I'm democratic and you're not," he teased; but he approved
thoroughly of everything she did.She was, he sometimes fancied, a
better executive in her world than he was in his.Drifting in this fashion, wining, dining, drinking the waters of
this curative spring and that, traveling in luxurious ease and taking
no physical exercise, finally altered his body from a vigorous,
quick-moving, well-balanced organism into one where plethora of
substance was clogging every essential function.His liver, kidneys,
spleen, pancreas--every organ, in fact--had been overtaxed
for some time to keep up the process of digestion and elimination.In
the past seven years he had become uncomfortably heavy.His kidneys
were weak, and so were the arteries of his brain.By dieting, proper
exercise, the right mental attitude, he might have lived to be eighty
or ninety.As a matter of fact, he was allowing himself to drift into
a physical state in which even a slight malady might prove dangerous.It so happened that he and Letty had gone to the North Cape on a
cruise with a party of friends.Lester, in order to attend to some
important business, decided to return to Chicago late in November; he
arranged to have his wife meet him in New York just before the
Christmas holidays.He wrote Watson to expect him, and engaged rooms
at the Auditorium, for he had sold the Chicago residence some two
years before and was now living permanently in New York.One late November day, after having attended to a number of details
and cleared up his affairs very materially, Lester was seized with
what the doctor who was called to attend him described as a cold in
the intestines--a disturbance usually symptomatic of some other
weakness, either of the blood or of some organ.He suffered great
pain, and the usual remedies in that case were applied.There were
bandages of red flannel with a mustard dressing, and specifics were
also administered.He experienced some relief, but he was troubled
with a sense of impending disaster.He had Watson cable his
wife--there was nothing serious about it, but he was ill.A
trained nurse was in attendance and his valet stood guard at the door
to prevent annoyance of any kind.It was plain that Letty could not
reach Chicago under three weeks.He had the feeling that he would not
see her again.Curiously enough, not only because he was in Chicago, but because
he had never been spiritually separated from Jennie, he was thinking
about her constantly at this time.He had intended to go out and see
her just as soon as he was through with his business engagements and
before he left the city.He had asked Watson how she was getting
along, and had been informed that everything was well with her.She
was living quietly and looking in good health, so Watson said.Lester
wished he could see her.This thought grew as the days passed and he grew no better.He was
suffering from time to time with severe attacks of griping pains that
seemed to tie his viscera into knots, and left him very weak.Several
times the physician administered cocaine with a needle in order to
relieve him of useless pain.After one of the severe attacks he called Watson to his side, told
him to send the nurse away, and then said: "Watson, I'd like to have
you do me a favor.Stover if she won't come here to see me.Just send the nurse and Kozo (the valet)
away for the afternoon, or while she's here.If she comes at any other
time I'd like to have her admitted."He wondered what the world
would think if it could know of this bit of romance in connection with
so prominent a man.The latter was only too glad to serve him in any way.He called a carriage and rode out to Jennie's residence.He found
her watering some plants; her face expressed her surprise at his
unusual presence."I come on a rather troublesome errand, Mrs.Stover," he said,
using her assumed name.Kane is quite sick at
the Auditorium.His wife is in Europe, and he wanted to know if I
wouldn't come out here and ask you to come and see him.He wanted me
to bring you, if possible."Why yes," said Jennie, her face a study.An old Swedish housekeeper was in the kitchen.But there was coming back to her in detail a dream she
had had several nights before.It had seemed to her that she was out
on a dark, mystic body of water over which was hanging something like
a fog, or a pall of smoke.She heard the water ripple, or stir
faintly, and then out of the surrounding darkness a boat appeared.It
was a little boat, oarless, or not visibly propelled, and in it were
her mother, and Vesta, and some one whom she could not make out.Her
mother's face was pale and sad, very much as she had often seen it in
life.She looked at Jennie solemnly, sympathetically, and then
suddenly Jennie realized that the third occupant of the boat was
Lester.He looked at her gloomily--an expression she had never
seen on his face before--and then her mother remarked, "Well, we
must go now."The boat began to move, a great sense of loss came over
her, and she cried, "Oh, don't leave me, mamma!"But her mother only looked at her out of deep, sad, still eyes, and
the boat was gone.She woke with a start, half fancying that Lester was beside her.She stretched out her hand to touch his arm; then she drew herself up
in the dark and rubbed her eyes, realizing that she was alone.A great
sense of depression remained with her, and for two days it haunted
her.Then, when it seemed as if it were nothing, Mr.She went to dress, and reappeared, looking as troubled as were her
thoughts.She was very pleasing in her appearance yet, a sweet, kindly
woman, well dressed and shapely.She had never been separated mentally
from Lester, just as he had never grown entirely away from her.She
was always with him in thought, just as in the years when they were
together.Her fondest memories were of the days when he first courted
her in Cleveland--the days when he had carried her off, much as
the cave-man seized his mate--by force.Now she longed to do what
she could for him.For this call was as much a testimony as a shock.He loved her--he loved her, after all.The carriage rolled briskly through the long streets into the smoky
down-town district.It arrived at the Auditorium, and Jennie was
escorted to Lester's room.He had talked
little, leaving her to her thoughts.In this great hotel she felt
diffident after so long a period of complete retirement.As she
entered the room she looked at Lester with large, gray, sympathetic
eyes.He was lying propped up on two pillows, his solid head with its
growth of once dark brown hair slightly grayed.He looked at her
curiously out of his wise old eyes, a light of sympathy and affection
shining in them--weary as they were.His pale face, slightly drawn from suffering, cut her like
a knife.She took his hand, which was outside the coverlet, and
pressed it."I'm so sorry, Lester," she murmured.You're not
very sick though, are you?You must get well, Lester--and soon!""Yes, Jennie, but I'm pretty bad," he said."I don't feel right
about this business.I don't seem able to shake it off.But tell me,
how have you been?""Oh, just the same, dear," she replied.You mustn't
talk like that, though.You're going to be all right very soon
now."He shook his head, for he
thought differently."Sit down, dear," he went on, "I'm not worrying
about that.He
sighed and shut his eyes for a minute.She drew up a chair close beside the bed, her face toward his, and
took his hand.It seemed such a beautiful thing that he should send
for her.Her eyes showed the mingled sympathy, affection, and
gratitude of her heart.At the same time fear gripped her; how ill he
looked!"I can't tell what may happen," he went on.I've wanted to see you again for some time.We are living in New York, you know.You're a little stouter,
Jennie.""Yes, I'm getting old, Lester," she smiled."Oh, that doesn't make any difference," he replied, looking at her
fixedly.A slight twinge of pain
reminded him of the vigorous seizures he had been through.He couldn't
stand many more paroxysms like the last one."I couldn't go, Jennie, without seeing you again," he observed,
when the slight twinge ceased and he was free to think again."I've
always wanted to say to you, Jennie," he went on, "that I haven't been
satisfied with the way we parted.It wasn't the right thing, after
all.I wish now, for my own
peace of mind, that I hadn't done it.""Don't say that, Lester," she demurred, going over in her mind all
that had been between them.This was such a testimony to their real
union--their real spiritual compatibility.I wouldn't
have been satisfied to have you lose your fortune.I've been a lot better satisfied as it is.It's been hard, but,
dear, everything is hard at times."The thing wasn't worked out right
from the start; but that wasn't your fault.I'm glad I'm here to do it.""Don't talk that way, Lester--please don't," she pleaded.Why, when I think--" she
stopped, for it was hard for her to speak.She was choking with
affection and sympathy.She was recalling the
house he took for her family in Cleveland, his generous treatment of
Gerhardt, all the long ago tokens of love and kindness."Well, I've told you now, and I feel better.You're a good woman,
Jennie, and you're kind to come to me this way."It seems strange, but you're the
only woman I ever did love truly.It was the one thing she had waited for
all these years--this testimony.It was the one thing that could
make everything right--this confession of spiritual if not
material union."Oh, Lester,"
she exclaimed with a sob, and pressed his hand."Oh, they're lovely," she answered, entering upon a detailed
description of their diminutive personalities.He listened
comfortably, for her voice was soothing to him.When it came time for her to go he seemed
desirous of keeping her."I can stay just as well as not, Lester," she volunteered."You needn't do that," he said, but she could see that he wanted
her, that he did not want to be alone.From that time on until the hour of his death she was not out of
the hotel.CHAPTER LXII


The end came after four days during which Jennie was by his bedside
almost constantly.The nurse in charge welcomed her at first as a
relief and company, but the physician was inclined to object.Lester,
however, was stubborn."This is my death," he said, with a touch of
grim humor."If I'm dying I ought to be allowed to die in my own
way."Watson smiled at the man's unfaltering courage.He had never seen
anything like it before.There were cards of sympathy, calls of inquiry, notices in the
newspaper.Robert saw an item in the Inquirer and decided to go
to Chicago.Imogene called with her husband, and they were admitted to
Lester's room for a few minutes after Jennie had gone to hers.The nurse cautioned them that he was not to be
talked to much.When they were gone Lester said to Jennie, "Imogene
has changed a good deal."Kane was on the Atlantic three days out from New York the
afternoon Lester died.He had been meditating whether anything more
could be done for Jennie, but he could not make up his mind about it.Certainly it was useless to leave her more money.He had been wondering where Letty was and how near her actual arrival
might be when he was seized with a tremendous paroxysm of pain.Before
relief could be administered in the shape of an anesthetic he was
dead.It developed afterward that it was not the intestinal trouble
which killed him, but a lesion of a major blood-vessel in the
brain.Jennie, who had been strongly wrought up by watching and worrying,
was beside herself with grief.He had been a part of her thought and
feeling so long that it seemed now as though a part of herself had
died.She had loved him as she had fancied she could never love any
one, and he had always shown that he cared for her--at least in
some degree.She could not feel the emotion that expresses itself in
tears--only a dull ache, a numbness which seemed to make her
insensible to pain.He looked so strong--her Lester--lying
there still in death.His expression was unchanged--defiant,
determined, albeit peaceful.Kane that she
would arrive on the Wednesday following.Watson that it was to be transferred to
Cincinnati, where the Paces had a vault.Because of the arrival of
various members of the family, Jennie withdrew to her own home; she
could do nothing more.The final ceremonies presented a peculiar commentary on the
anomalies of existence.Kane by wire that
the body should be transferred to Imogene's residence, and the funeral
held from there.Robert, who arrived the night Lester died; Berry
Dodge, Imogene's husband; Mr.Midgely, and three other citizens of
prominence were selected as pall-bearers.Louise and her husband came
from Buffalo; Amy and her husband from Cincinnati.The house was full
to overflowing with citizens who either sincerely wished or felt it
expedient to call.Because of the fact that Lester and his family were
tentatively Catholic, a Catholic priest was called in and the ritual
of that Church was carried out.It was curious to see him lying in the
parlor of this alien residence, candles at his head and feet, burning
sepulchrally, a silver cross upon his breast, caressed by his waxen
fingers.He would have smiled if he could have seen himself, but the
Kane family was too conventional, too set in its convictions, to find
anything strange in this.She was greatly distraught, for her
love, like Jennie's, was sincere.She left her room that night when
all was silent and leaned over the coffin, studying by the light of
the burning candles Lester's beloved features.Tears trickled down her
cheeks, for she had been happy with him.She caressed his cold cheeks
and hands.No
one told her that he had sent for Jennie.Meanwhile in the house on South Park Avenue sat a woman who was
enduring alone the pain, the anguish of an irreparable loss.Through
all these years the subtle hope had persisted, in spite of every
circumstance, that somehow life might bring him back to her.He had
come, it is true--he really had in death--but he had gone
again.Whither her mother, whither Gerhardt, whither Vesta had
gone?She could not hope to see him again, for the papers had informed
her of his removal to Mrs.Midgely's residence, and of the fact that
he was to be taken from Chicago to Cincinnati for burial.The last
ceremonies in Chicago were to be held in one of the wealthy Roman
Catholic churches of the South Side, St.Michael's, of which the
Midgelys were members.She would have liked so much to have
had him buried in Chicago, where she could go to the grave
occasionally, but this was not to be.She was never a master of her
fate.She thought of him as being taken
from her finally by the removal of the body to Cincinnati, as though
distance made any difference.She decided at last to veil herself
heavily and attend the funeral at the church.The paper had explained
that the services would be at two in the afternoon.Then at four the
body would be taken to the depot, and transferred to the train; the
members of the family would accompany it to Cincinnati.A little before the time for the funeral cortege to arrive at the
church there appeared at one of its subsidiary entrances a woman in
black, heavily veiled, who took a seat in an inconspicuous corner.She
was a little nervous at first, for, seeing that the church was dark
and empty, she feared lest she had mistaken the time and place; but
after ten minutes of painful suspense a bell in the church tower began
to toll solemnly.Shortly thereafter an acolyte in black gown and
white surplice appeared and lighted groups of candles on either side
of the altar.A hushed stirring of feet in the choir-loft indicated
that the service was to be accompanied by music.Some loiterers,
attracted by the bell, some idle strangers, a few acquaintances and
citizens not directly invited appeared and took seats.Never in her life had
she been inside a Catholic church.The gloom, the beauty of the
windows, the whiteness of the altar, the golden flames of the candles
impressed her.She was suffused with a sense of sorrow, loss, beauty,
and mystery.Life in all its vagueness and uncertainty seemed typified
by this scene.As the bell tolled there came from the sacristy a procession of
altar-boys.The smallest, an angelic youth of eleven, came first,
bearing aloft a magnificent silver cross.In the hands of each
subsequent pair of servitors was held a tall, lighted candle.The
priest, in black cloth and lace, attended by an acolyte on either
hand, followed.The procession passed out the entrance into the
vestibule of the church, and was not seen again until the choir began
a mournful, responsive chant, the Latin supplication for mercy and
peace.Then, at this sound the solemn procession made its reappearance.There came the silver cross, the candles, the dark-faced priest,
reading dramatically to himself as he walked, and the body of Lester
in a great black coffin, with silver handles, carried by the
pall-bearers, who kept an even pace.Jennie stiffened perceptibly, her
nerves responding as though to a shock from an electric current.She
did not know any of these men.Of the long company of notables who followed two by
two she recognized only three, whom Lester had pointed out to her in
times past.Kane she saw, of course, for she was directly behind
the coffin, leaning on the arm of a stranger; behind her walked Mr.He gave a quick glance to either side,
evidently expecting to see her somewhere; but not finding her, he
turned his eyes gravely forward and walked on.Jennie looked with all
her eyes, her heart gripped by pain.She seemed so much a part of this
solemn ritual, and yet infinitely removed from it all.The procession reached the altar rail, and the coffin was put down.A white shroud bearing the insignia of suffering, a black cross, was
put over it, and the great candles were set beside it.There were the
chanted invocations and responses, the sprinkling of the coffin with
holy water, the lighting and swinging of the censer and then the
mumbled responses of the auditors to the Lord's Prayer and to its
Catholic addition, the invocation to the Blessed Virgin.Jennie was
overawed and amazed, but no show of form colorful, impression
imperial, could take away the sting of death, the sense of infinite
loss.To Jennie the candles, the incense, the holy song were
beautiful.They touched the deep chord of melancholy in her, and made
it vibrate through the depths of her being.She was as a house filled
with mournful melody and the presence of death.Kane was sobbing convulsively
also.When it was all over the carriages were entered and the body was
borne to the station.All the guests and strangers departed, and
finally, when all was silent, she arose.Now she would go to the depot
also, for she was hopeful of seeing his body put on the train.They
would have to bring it out on the platform, just as they did in
Vesta's case.She took a car, and a little later she entered the
waiting-room of the depot.She lingered about, first in the concourse,
where the great iron fence separated the passengers from the tracks,
and then in the waiting-room, hoping to discover the order of
proceedings.She finally observed the group of immediate relatives
waiting--Mrs.Midgely, Louise, Amy, Imogene,
and the others.She actually succeeded in identifying most of them,
though it was not knowledge in this case, but pure instinct and
intuition.No one had noticed it in the stress of excitement, but it was
Thanksgiving Eve.Throughout the great railroad station there was a
hum of anticipation, that curious ebullition of fancy which springs
from the thought of pleasures to come.Announcers were
calling in stentorian voices the destination of each new train as the
time of its departure drew near.Jennie heard with a desperate ache
the description of a route which she and Lester had taken more than
once, slowly and melodiously emphasized."Detroit, Toledo, Cleveland,
Buffalo, and New York."There were cries of trains for "Fort Wayne,
Columbus, Pittsburg, Philadelphia, and points East," and then finally
for "Indianapolis, Louisville, Columbus, Cincinnati, and points
South."Several times Jennie had gone to the concourse between the
waiting-room and the tracks to see if through the iron grating which
separated her from her beloved she could get one last look at the
coffin, or the great wooden box which held it, before it was put on
the train.There was a baggage porter pushing a
truck into position near the place where the baggage car would stop.On it was Lester, that last shadow of his substance, incased in the
honors of wood, and cloth, and silver.There was no thought on the
part of the porter of the agony of loss which was represented here.He
could not see how wealth and position in this hour were typified to
her mind as a great fence, a wall, which divided her eternally from
her beloved.Was not her life a patchwork
of conditions made and affected by these things which she
saw--wealth and force--which had found her unfit?She had
evidently been born to yield, not seek.This panoply of power had been
paraded before her since childhood.What could she do now but stare
vaguely after it as it marched triumphantly by?She looked through the
grating, and once more there came the cry of "Indianapolis,
Louisville, Columbus, Cincinnati, and points South."A long red train,
brilliantly lighted, composed of baggage cars, day coaches, a
dining-car, set with white linen and silver, and a half dozen
comfortable Pullmans, rolled in and stopped.A great black engine,
puffing and glowing, had it all safely in tow.As the baggage car drew near the waiting truck a train-hand in
blue, looking out of the car, called to some one within.All she could see was the great box that was so soon to disappear.All she could feel was that this train would start presently, and then
it would all be over.There were Robert, and Amy, and Louise, and Midgely--all making
for the Pullman cars in the rear.They had said their farewells to
their friends.A trio of assistants "gave a
hand" at getting the great wooden case into the car.Jennie saw it
disappear with an acute physical wrench at her heart.There were many trunks to be put aboard, and then the door of the
baggage car half closed, but not before the warning bell of the engine
sounded.There was the insistent calling of "all aboard" from this
quarter and that; then slowly the great locomotive began to move.Its
bell was ringing, its steam hissing, its smoke-stack throwing aloft a
great black plume of smoke that fell back over the cars like a pall.The fireman, conscious of the heavy load behind, flung open a flaming
furnace door to throw in coal.Jennie stood rigid, staring into the wonder of this picture, her
face white, her eyes wide, her hands unconsciously clasped, but one
thought in her mind--they were taking his body away.A leaden
November sky was ahead, almost dark.She looked, and looked until the
last glimmer of the red lamp on the receding sleeper disappeared in
the maze of smoke and haze overhanging the tracks of the
far-stretching yard."Yes," said the voice of a passing stranger, gay with the
anticipation of coming pleasures."We're going to have a great time
down there.Uncle Jim is coming and Aunt Ella."Jennie did not hear that or anything else of the chatter and bustle
around her.Before her was stretching a vista of lonely years down
which she was steadily gazing.There
were those two orphan children to raise.They would marry and leave
after a while, and then what?Days and days in endless reiteration,
and then--?PIERRE

You are greatly agitated, father.EMIL GRELIEU

I have always thought, I have always been convinced that words
were at my command, but here I stand before this monstrous,
inexplicable--I don't know, I don't know what to call them.My
heart is crying out, I hear its voice, but the word!Pierre,
you are a student, you are young, your words are direct and
pure--Pierre, find the word!PIERRE

You want me to find it, father?Yes, I was a student, and I knew
certain words: Peace, Right, Humanity.My heart
is crying too, but I do not know what to call these scoundrels.EMIL GRELIEU

That is not strong enough.Pierre, I have decided--

PIERRE

Decided?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, I am going.EMIL GRELIEU

I decided to do it several days ago--even then, at the very
beginning.And I really don't know why I--.Oh, yes, I had to
overcome within me--my love for flowers._Ironically._

Yes, Pierre, my love for flowers.Oh, my boy, it is so hard to
change from flowers to iron and blood!PIERRE

Father, I dare not contradict you.EMIL GRELIEU

No, no, you dare not.Listen, Pierre, you
must examine me as a physician.PIERRE

I am only a student, father.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, but you know enough to say--.You see, Pierre, I must
not burden our little army with a single superfluous sick or
weak man.I must bring with me strength and
power, not shattered health.And I am asking
you, Pierre, to examine me, simply as a physician, as a young
physician.Must I
take this off, or can you do it without removing this?PIERRE

It can be done this way.EMIL GRELIEU

I think so, too.And--must I tell you everything, or--?At any
rate, I will tell you that I have not had any serious ailments,
and for my years I am a rather strong, healthy man.You know
what a life I am leading.PIERRE

That is unnecessary, father.EMIL GRELIEU

It is necessary.I want to say that in my
life there were none of those unwholesome--and bad excesses.Oh,
the devil take it, how hard it is to speak of it.PIERRE

Papa, I know all this.Silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

But it is necessary to take my pulse, Pierre, I beg of you.PIERRE

_Smiling faintly._

It isn't necessary to do even that.As a physician, I can tell
you that you are healthy, but--you are unfit for war, you are
unfit for war, father!I am listening to you and I feel like
crying, father.EMIL GRELIEU

_Thoughtfully._

Yes, yes.Do you think,
Pierre, that I should not kill?Pierre, you think, that I, Emil
Grelieu, must not kill under any circumstances and at any time?PIERRE

_Softly._

I dare not touch upon your conscience, father.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, that is a terrible question for a man.Of course, I could take your gun, but not to fire--no,
that would have been disgusting, a sacrilegious deception!When
my humble people are condemned to kill, who am I that I should
keep my hands clean?That would be disgusting cleanliness,
obnoxious saintliness.My humble nation did not desire to kill,
but it was forced, and it has become a murderer.So I, too, must
become a murderer, together with my nation.Upon whose shoulders
will I place the sin--upon the shoulders of our youths and
children?And if ever the Higher Conscience of the
world will call my dear people to the terrible accounting, if
it will call you and Maurice, my children, and will say to you:
"What have you done?I will come forward and
will say: "First you must judge me; I have also murdered--and
you know that I am an honest man!"_Pierre sits motionless, his face covered with his hands.Enter
Jeanne, unnoticed._

PIERRE

_Uncovering his face._

But you must not die!EMIL GRELIEU

_Loudly, and with contempt._

Oh, death!Jeanne sits down and
speaks in the same tone of strange, almost cheerful calm._

JEANNE

Emil, she is here again.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes?JEANNE

She does not know herself.Emil, her dress and her hands were in
blood.EMIL GRELIEU

She is wounded?JEANNE

No, it is not her own blood, and by the color I could not tell
whose blood it is.PIERRE

Who is that, mother?I have combed her hair and
put a clean dress on her.Emil, I have
heard something--I understand that you want to go--?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.JEANNE

Together with your children, Emil?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.Pierre has examined me and finds that I am fit to enter the
ranks.JEANNE

You intend to go tomorrow?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.JEANNE

You cannot manage it today.Pierre, you have only an hour and a
half left._Silence._

PIERRE

Mamma!Tell him that he must not--Forgive me, father!--that he
should not go.He has given
to the nation his two sons--what more should he give?JEANNE

More, Pierre?PIERRE

Yes,--his life.You love him; you, yourself, would die if he
were killed--tell him that, mother!JEANNE

Yes, I love him.PIERRE

Oh, what are we, Maurice and I?Just as they have no
right to destroy temples in war or to bum libraries, just as
they have no right to touch the eternal, so he--he--has no right
to die.I am speaking not as your son, no; but to kill Emil
Grelieu--that would be worse than to bum books.Listen to me!--although I
am young and should be silent--Listen to me!They have deprived us of our land and of the air;
they have destroyed our treasures which have been created
by the genius of our people, and now we would cast our best
men into their jaws!Let them kill us all, let our land be turned into a waste
desert, let all living creatures be burned to death, but as long
as he lives, Belgium is alive!Oh,
do not be silent, mother!_Silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

_Somewhat sternly._

Calm yourself, Pierre!JEANNE

Yesterday I--no, Pierre, that isn't what I was going to say--I
don't know anything about it.But yesterday
I--it is hard to get vegetables, and even bread, here--so I went
to town, and for some reason we did not go in that direction,
but nearer the field of battle--.How strange it is that we
found ourselves there!And there I saw them coming--

EMIL GRELIEU

Whom?They were coming from there--where the battle
raged for four days.There were not many of them--about a
hundred or two hundred.But we all--there were so many people in
the streets--we all stepped back to the wall in order to make
way for them.Emil, just think of it; how strange!They did not
see us, and we would have been in their way!They were black
from smoke, from mud, from dried blood, and they were swaying
from fatigue.But that is
nothing, that is all nothing.They did not see their surroundings, they still reflected that
which they had seen there--fire and smoke and death--and what
else?Some one said: "Here are people returning from hell."We
all bowed to them, we bowed to them, but they did not see that
either.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, Jeanne, that is possible.PIERRE

And he will go to that inferno?Emil Grelieu walks over to his wife and kisses her
hand.Suddenly she rises._

JEANNE

Forgive me; there is something else I must say--

_She moves quickly and lightly, but suddenly, as though
stumbling over an invisible obstacle, falls on one knee.Then
she tries to rise, kneels, pale and still smiling, bending to
one side.They rush over to her and lift her from the ground._

PIERRE

Mamma!EMIL GRELIEU

You have a headache?Jeanne, my dearest, what ails you?_She pushes them aside, stands up firmly, trying to conceal her
nervousness._

JEANNE

What is it?My foot
slipped--you know, the one that pained me.EMIL GRELIEU

A glass of water, Pierre.Jeanne sits down, hangs her
head, as one guilty, endeavoring not to look into his eyes._

JEANNE

What an excitable youth--your Pierre!EMIL GRELIEU

_Significantly._

Jeanne!No, no--why do you look at me this way?_Pierre brings her water, but Jeanne does not drink it._

JEANNE

Thank you, Pierre, but I don't want it._Silence._

How fragrant the flowers are.Pierre, please give me that
rose--yes, that one.How fresh it is, Emil, and what
a fine fragrance--come over here, Emil!_Emil Grelieu goes over to her and kisses the hand in which she
holds the rose.Looks at her._

JEANNE

_Lowering her hand._

No; I have asked for this flower simply because its fragrance
seems to me immortal--it is always the same--as the sky.How
strange it is, always the same.And when you bring it close to
your face, and close to your eyes, it seems to you that there is
nothing except this red rose and the blue sky.Nothing but the
red rose and the distant, pale--very pale--blue sky....

EMIL GRELIEU

Pierre!People speak of this only at
night, when they are alone with their souls--and she knows it,
but you do not know it yet.JEANNE

_Trembling, opening her eyes._

Yes, I know, Emil.EMIL GRELIEU

The life of the poet does not belong to him.The roof over the
heads of people, which shelters them--all that is a phantom for
me, and my life does not belong to me.I am always far away, not
here--I am always where I am not.You think of finding me among
the living, while I am dead; you are afraid of finding me in
death, mute, cold, doomed to decay, while I live and sing aloud
from my grave.Death which makes people mute, which leaves the
imprint of silence upon the bravest lips, restores the voice
to the poet.Am I--just think of it, Pierre, my boy,--am I to fear
death when in my most persistent searches I could not find the
boundary between life and death, when in my feelings I mix life
and death into one--as two strong, rare kinds of wine?Emil Grelieu looks at his son, smiling.Pierre has
covered his face with his hands.She turns her eyes from her weeping son to her husband._

PIERRE

_Uncovering his face._

Forgive me, father!JEANNE

Take this rose, Pierre, and when it fades and falls apart tear
down another rose--it will have the same fragrance as this one.You are a foolish little boy, Pierre, but I am also foolish,
although Emil is so kind that he thinks differently.Will you be
in the same regiment, Emil?EMIL GRELIEU

No, hardly, Jeanne.PIERRE

Father, it is better that we be in the same regiment.I will
arrange it, father--will you permit me?And I will teach you how
to march--.You know, I am going to be your superior officer.EMIL GRELIEU

_Smiling._

Very well.JEANNE

_Goes out singing in a low voice._

"Only the halo of the arts is crowning--law, liberty, and the
King."Look, Pierre, here is the girl you
wished to see.Come in, come in, my dear child!He is a very good man
and will do you no harm._A girl enters; she is frail, very pale, and beautiful.She
wears a black dress, her hair is combed neatly, and she is
modest in her demeanor.She
is followed by the chambermaid, Silvina, a kind, elderly woman
in a white cap; by Madame Henrietta, and another woman in the
service of the Grelieu household.They stop at the threshold
and watch the girl curiously.The elder woman is weeping as she
looks at her._

GIRL

_Stretching forth her hand to Pierre._

Oh, that is a soldier!Be so kind, soldier, tell me how to go to
Lonua.PIERRE

_Confused._

I do not know, Mademoiselle.GIRL

_Looking at everybody mournfully._

Who knows?JEANNE

_Cautiously and tenderly leading her to a seat._

Sit down, child, take a rest, my dear, give your poor feet a
rest.Pierre, her feet are wounded, yet she wants to walk all
the time.ELDERLY WOMAN

I wanted to stop her, Monsieur Pierre, but it is impossible to
stop her.If we close the door before her the poor girl beats
her head against the walls, like a bird in a cage.François enters from the garden and occupies
himself again with the flowers.He glances at the girl from time
to time.It is evident that he is making painful efforts to hear
and understand what is going on._

GIRL

It is time for me to go.JEANNE

Rest yourself, here, my child!At night it
is so terrible on the roads.There, in the dark air, bullets are
buzzing instead of our dear bees; there wicked people, vicious
beasts are roaming.And there is no one who can tell you, for
there is no one who knows how to go to Lonua.GIRL

Don't you know how I could find my way to Lonua?PIERRE

_Softly._

What is she asking?Emil GRELIEU

Oh, you may speak louder; she can hear as little as François.She is asking about the village which the Prussians have set on
fire.Her home used to be there--now there are only ruins and
corpses there.There is no road that leads to Lonua!GIRL

Don't you know it, either?I have asked everybody,
and no one can tell me how to find my way to Lonua._She rises quickly and walks over to François._

Tell me; you are kindhearted!Don't you know the way to Lonua?_François looks at her intently.Silently he turns away and
walks out, stooping._

JEANNE

_Seating her again._

Sit down, little girl.GIRL

_Sadly._

I am asking, and they are silent.EMIL GRELIEU

I suppose she is also asking the bodies of the dead that lie in
the fields and in the ditches how to go to Lonua.JEANNE

Her hands and her dress were bloodstained.I will hold you in my arms,
and you will feel better and more comfortable, my little child.GIRL

_Softly._

Tell me, how can I find my way to Lonua?JEANNE

Yes, yes, come!Emil, I will go with her to my room.Emil Grelieu and
Pierre remain._

EMIL GRELIEU

Lonua!A quiet little village which no one ever noticed
before--houses, trees, and flowers.Who knows
the way to that little village?Pierre, the soul of our people
is roaming about in the watches of the night, asking the dead
how to find the way to Lonua!Pierre, I cannot endure it any
longer!Oh, weep,
you German Nation--bitter will be the fate of your children,
terrible will be your disgrace before the judgment of the free
nations!_Curtain_



SCENE III


_Night.The dark silhouette of Emil Grelieu's villa stands
out in the background.The gatekeeper's house is seen among
the trees, a dim light in the window.At the cast-iron fence
frightened women are huddled together, watching the fire in the
distance.An alarming redness has covered the sky; only in the
zenith is the sky dark.The reflection of the fire falls upon
objects and people, casting strange shadows against the mirrors
of the mute and dark villa.The voices sound muffled and timid;
there are frequent pauses and prolonged sighs.HENRIETTA

My God, my God!It is burning and burning,
and there is no end to the fire!SECOND WOMAN

Yesterday it was burning further away, and tonight the fire is
nearer.HENRIETTA

It is burning and burning, there is no end to the fire!Today
the sun was covered in a mist.SECOND WOMAN

It is forever burning, and the sun is growing ever darker!Now
it is lighter at night than in the daytime!SILVINA

I am afraid!HENRIETTA

Be silent, Silvina, be silent!_Silence._

SECOND WOMAN

I can't hear a sound.If I close my eyes
it seems to me that nothing is going on there.HENRIETTA

I can see all that is going on there even with my eyes closed.SILVINA

Oh, I am afraid!SECOND WOMAN

Where is it burning?HENRIETTA

I don't know.It is burning and burning, and there is no end to
the fire!It may be that they have all perished by this time.It may be that something terrible is going on there, and we are
looking on and know nothing._A fourth woman approaches them quietly._

FOURTH WOMAN

Good evening!SILVINA

_With restraint._

Oh!HENRIETTA

Oh, you have frightened us!FOURTH WOMAN

Good evening, Madame Henrietta!Never mind my coming here--it
is terrible to stay in the house!I guessed that you were not
sleeping, but here, watching.And we can't hear a sound--how quiet!HENRIETTA

It is burning and burning.Haven't you heard anything about your
husband?FOURTH WOMAN

No, nothing.HENRIETTA

And with whom are your children just now?FOURTH WOMAN

Alone.Is it true that Monsieur Pierre was
killed?HENRIETTA

_Agitated._

Just imagine!I simply cannot understand what is
going on!You see, there is no one in the house now, and we are
afraid to sleep there--

SECOND WOMAN

The three of us sleep here, in the gatekeeper's house.HENRIETTA

I am afraid to look into that house even in the daytime--the
house is so large and so empty!And there are no men there, not
a soul--

FOURTH WOMAN

Is it true that François has gone to shoot the Prussians?Everybody is talking about it, but we don't know.He
disappeared quietly, like a mouse.FOURTH WOMAN

He will be hanged--the Prussians hang such people!HENRIETTA

Wait, wait!Today, while I was in the garden, I heard the
telephone ringing in the house; it was ringing for a long time.I was frightened, but I went in after all--and, just think of
it!Some one said: "Monsieur Pierre was killed!"SECOND WOMAN

And nothing more?HENRIETTA

Nothing more; not a word!I felt so bad
and was so frightened that I could hardly run out.Now I will
not enter that house for anything!FOURTH WOMAN

Whose voice was it?SECOND WOMAN

Madame Henrietta says it was an unfamiliar voice.HENRIETTA

Yes, an unfamiliar voice.There seems to be a light in the windows of the
house--somebody is there!SILVINA

Oh, I am afraid!HENRIETTA

Oh, what are you saying; what are you saying?SECOND WOMAN

That's from the redness of the sky!FOURTH WOMAN

What if some one is ringing there again?HENRIETTA

How is that possible?Silence._

SECOND WOMAN

What will become of us?They are coming this way, and there is
nothing that can stop them!FOURTH WOMAN

I wish I might die now!When you are dead, you don't hear or see
anything.HENRIETTA

It keeps on all night like this--it is burning and burning!And
in the daytime it will again be hard to see things on account of
the smoke; and the bread will smell of burning!FOURTH WOMAN

They have killed Monsieur Pierre.SECOND WOMAN

They have killed him?SILVINA

You must not speak of it!_Weeps softly._

FOURTH WOMAN

They say there are twenty millions of them, and they have
already set Paris on fire.They say they have cannon which can
hit a hundred kilometers away.HENRIETTA

My God, my God!SECOND WOMAN

Merciful God, have pity on us!FOURTH WOMAN

And they are flying and they are hurling bombs from
airships--terrible bombs, which destroy entire cities!HENRIETTA

My God!Before this You were
alone in the sky, and now those base Prussians are there too!SECOND WOMAN

Before this, when my soul wanted rest and joy I looked at the
sky, but now there is no place where a poor soul can find rest
and joy!FOURTH WOMAN

They have taken everything away from our Belgium--even the sky!Don't you think that now my husband, my husband--

HENRIETTA

No, no!FOURTH WOMAN

Why is the sky so red?SECOND WOMAN

Have mercy on us, O God!The redness of the flames seems to be swaying over the
earth._

_Curtain_



SCENE IV


_Dawn.The sun has already risen, but it is hidden behind the
heavy mist and smoke._

_A large room in Emil Grelieu's villa, which has been turned
into a sickroom.There are two wounded there, Grelieu himself,
with a serious wound in his shoulder, and his son Maurice, with
a light wound on his right arm.The large window, covered with
half transparent curtains, admits a faint bluish light.In an armchair at the bedside of
Grelieu there is a motionless figure in white, Jeanne_.EMIL GRELIEU

_Softly._

Jeanne!JEANNE

Shall I give you some water?EMIL GRELIEU

No.JEANNE

Oh, no, not at all.Can't you fall
asleep, Emil?EMIL GRELIEU

What time is it?_She goes over to the window quietly, and pushing the curtain
aside slightly, looks at her little watch.Then she returns just
as quietly._

JEANNE

It is still early.Perhaps you will try to fall asleep, Emil?It
seems to me that you have been suffering great pain; you have
been groaning all night.EMIL GRELIEU

No, I am feeling better.JEANNE

Nasty weather, Emil; you can't see the sun.Suddenly Maurice utters a cry in his sleep; the cry
turns into a groan and indistinct mumbling.Jeanne walks over to
him and listens, then returns to her seat._

EMIL GRELIEU

Is the boy getting on well?JEANNE

Don't worry, Emil.He only said a few words in his sleep.EMIL GRELIEU

He has done it several times tonight.JEANNE

I am afraid that he is disturbing you.We can have him removed
to another room and Henrietta will stay with him.The boy's
blood is in good condition.In another week, I believe, we shall
be able to remove the bandage from his arm.EMIL GRELIEU

No, let him stay here, Jeanne.JEANNE

What is it, my dear?_She kneels at his bed and kisses his hand carefully._

EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne!JEANNE

I think your fever has gone down, my dear._Impresses another kiss upon his hand and clings to it._

EMIL GRELIEU

You are my love, Jeanne.JEANNE

Do not speak, do not speak._A brief moment of silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

_Moving his head restlessly._

It is so hard to breathe here, the air----

JEANNE

The window has been open all night, my dear.There is not a
breeze outside.EMIL GRELIEU

There is smoke.MAURICE

_Utters a cry once more, then mutters_--

Stop, stop, stop!_Again indistinctly._

It is burning, it is burning!Who is going to the battery,
who is going to the battery----

_He mutters and then grows silent._

EMIL GRELIEU

What painful dreams!JEANNE

That's nothing; the boy always used to talk in his sleep.EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne!JEANNE

What is it, my dear?EMIL GRELIEU

Sit down.EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne.... Are you thinking about Pierre?_Silence._

JEANNE

_Softly._

Don't speak of him.EMIL GRELIEU

You are right.JEANNE

_After a brief pause._

That's true.EMIL GRELIEU

We shall follow him later.He will not come here, but we shall
go to him.Do you
remember the red rose which you gave him?EMIL GRELIEU

It is so clear.You are the best woman in
the world._Silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

_Tossing about in his bed._

It is so hard to breathe.JEANNE

My dear----

EMIL GRELIEU

No, that's nothing.Jeanne, was I
dreaming, or have I really heard cannonading?JEANNE

You really heard it, at about five o'clock.But very far away,
Emil--it was hardly audible.Close your eyes, my dear, rest
yourself._Silence_

MAURICE

_Faintly._

Mamma!_Jeanne walks over to him quietly._

JEANNE

Are you awake?JEANNE

He is awake.EMIL GRELIEU

Good morning, Maurice.MAURICE

Good morning, papa.EMIL GRELIEU

I, too, am feeling well.Jeanne, you may draw the curtain aside.Still it will be easier for you to
breathe when it is light._She draws the curtain aside slowly, so as not to make it too
light at once.Beyond the large window vague silhouettes of the
trees are seen at the window frames and several withered, bent
flowers.Maurice is trying to adjust the screen._

JEANNE

What are you doing, Maurice?MAURICE

My coat--Never mind, I'll fix it myself._Guiltily._

No, mamma, you had better help me.JEANNE

_Going behind the screen._

What a foolish boy you are, Maurice._Behind the screen._

Be careful, be careful, that's the way.MAURICE

_Behind the screen._

Pin this for me right here, as you did yesterday.JEANNE

_Behind the screen._

Of course._Maurice comes out, his right arm dressed in a bandage.He goes
over to his father and first kisses his hand, then, upon a sign
from his eyes, he kisses him on the lips._

EMIL GRELIEU

Good morning, good morning, my dear boy.MAURICE

_Looking around at the screen, where his mother is putting the
bed in order._

Papa, look!_He takes his hand out of the bandage and straightens it
quickly.Emil Grelieu
threatens him with his finger.Jeanne puts the screen aside, and
the bed is already in order._

JEANNE

I am through now.MAURICE

Oh, no; under no circumstances.Last
night I washed myself with my left hand and it was very fine._Walking over to the open window._

How nasty it is.These scoundrels have spoiled the day.Still,
it is warm and there is the smell of flowers.It's good, papa;
it is very fine.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, it is pleasant.MAURICE

Well, I am going.JEANNE

Clean your teeth; you didn't do it yesterday, Maurice._

What's the use of it now?_

Papa, do you know, well have good news today; I feel it._He is heard calling in a ringing voice, "Silvina."_

EMIL GRELIEU

I feel better.JEANNE

I'll let you have your coffee directly.You are looking much
better today, much better.EMIL GRELIEU

What is this?JEANNE

Perfume, with water.I'll bathe your face with it That's the
way.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.JEANNE

He didn't mean anything.He is very happy because he is a hero.EMIL GRELIEU

Do you know any news?JEANNE

_Irresolutely._

Nothing.EMIL GRELIEU

Tell me, Jeanne; you were firmer before.JEANNE

Was I firmer?Perhaps.... I have grown accustomed to talk to
you softly at night.Well--how shall I tell it to you?EMIL GRELIEU

Coming?Don't be excited, but I
think that it will be necessary for us to leave for Antwerp
today.EMIL GRELIEU

Are they near?JEANNE

Yes, they are near._Sings softly._

"Le Roi, la Loi, la Liberté."I have not told you
that the King inquired yesterday about your health.I answered
that you were feeling better and that you will be able to leave
today.EMIL GRELIEU

Of course I am able to leave today.JEANNE

What did the King say?_Singing the same tune._

He said that their numbers were too great.EMIL GRELIEU

What else did he say?He said that there was a God and there was
righteousness.That's what I believe I heard him say--that there
was still a God and that righteousness was still in existence.But it is so good that they still
exist._Silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, in the daytime you are so different.Where do you get so
much strength, Jeanne?EMIL GRELIEU

I am forever looking at your hair.I am wondering why it hasn't
turned gray.JEANNE

I dye it at night, Emil.Oh, yes, I haven't told you yet--some one
will be here to see you today--Secretary Lagard and some one
else by the name of Count Clairmont.EMIL GRELIEU

Count Clairmont?JEANNE

It is not necessary that you should know him.He is simply known
as Count Clairmont, Count Clairmont--.That's a good name for a
very good man.EMIL GRELIEU

I know a very good man in Belgium--

JEANNE

Tsh!You must only remember--Count
Clairmont.They have some important matters to discuss with you,
I believe.And they'll send you an automobile, to take you to
Antwerp.EMIL GRELIEU

_Smiling._

Count Clairmont?JEANNE

_Also smiling._

Yes.You are loved by everybody, but if I were a King, I would
have sent you an aeroplane._Throwing back her hands in sorrow which she is trying vainly to
suppress._

Ah, how good it would be now to rise from the ground and
fly--and fly for a long, long time._Enter Maurice._

MAURICE

I am ready now, I have cleaned my teeth.I've even taken a walk
in the garden.But I have never before noticed that we have such
a beautiful garden!JEANNE

Coffee will be ready directly.If he disturbs you with his talk,
call me, Emil.MAURICE

Oh, I did not mean to disturb you.I'll not
disturb you any more.EMIL GRELIEU

You may speak, speak.JEANNE

But you must save your strength, don't forget that, Emil._Exit._

MAURICE

_Sitting down quietly at the window._

Perhaps I really ought not to speak, papa?EMIL GRELIEU

_Smiling faintly._

Can you be silent?MAURICE

_Blushing._

No, father, I cannot just now.I suppose I seem to you very
young.EMIL GRELIEU

And what do you think of it yourself?MAURICE

_Blushing again._

I am no longer as young as I was three weeks ago.Yes, only
three weeks ago--I remember the tolling of the bells in our
church, I remember how I teased François.How strange that
François has been lost and no one knows where he is.What does
it mean that a human being is lost and no one knows where he is?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.But need an old
man love his fatherland less than I love it, for instance?The
old people love it even more intensely.I am not tiring you, am I?An old man came to us, he was
very feeble, he asked for bullets--well, let them hang me too--I
gave him bullets.A few of our regiment made sport of him, but
he said: "If only one Prussian bullet will strike me, it means
that the Prussians will have one bullet less."EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, that appeals to me, too.Have you heard the cannonading at
dawn?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.Did mamma tell you that they are
coming nearer and nearer?MAURICE

_Rising._

Really?EMIL GRELIEU

They are coming, and we must leave for Antwerp today._He rises and walks back and forth, forgetting his wounded arm.Clenches his fist._

MAURICE

Father, tell me: What do you think of the present state of
affairs?EMIL GRELIEU

Mamma says there is a God and there is righteousness.MAURICE

_Raising his hand._

Mamma says----Let God bless mamma!_His face twitches like a child's face.He is trying to repress
his tears._

MAURICE

I still owe them something for Pierre.Forgive me, father; I
don't know whether I have a right to say this or not, but I am
altogether different from you.It is wicked but I can't help it.I was looking this morning at your flowers in the garden and I
felt so sorry--sorry for you, because you had grown them.EMIL GRELIEU

Maurice!MAURICE

The scoundrels!I don't want to consider them human beings, and
I shall not consider them human beings._Enter Jeanne._

JEANNE

What is it, Maurice?_As he passes he embraces his mother with his left hand and
kisses her._

JEANNE

You had better sit down.It is dangerous for your health to walk
around this way.EMIL GRELIEU

Sit down, Maurice._Maurice sits down at the window facing the garden.Emil Grelieu
smiles sadly and closes his eyes.Silvina, the maid, brings in
coffee and sets it on the table near Grelieu's bed._

SILVINA

Good morning, Monsieur Emil.EMIL GRELIEU

_Opening his eyes._

Good morning, Silvina._Exit Silvina._

JEANNE

Go and have your breakfast, Maurice.MAURICE

_Without turning around._

I don't want any breakfast.Mamma, I'll take off my bandage
tomorrow.JEANNE

_Laughing._

Soldier, is it possible that you are capricious?Jeanne helps Emil Grelieu with his coffee._

JEANNE

That's the way.Is it convenient for you this way, or do you
want to drink it with a spoon?EMIL GRELIEU

Oh, my poor head, it is so weak--

MAURICE

_Going over to him._

Forgive me, father, I'll not do it any more.I was foolishly
excited, but do you know I could not endure it.May I have a
cup, mamma?JEANNE

Yes, this is yours.MAURICE

Yes, I do.EMIL GRELIEU

I am feeling perfectly well today, Jeanne.When is the bandage
to be changed?Count Clairmont will bring his surgeon along with him.MAURICE

Who is that, mamma?JEANNE

You'll see him.But, please, Maurice, when you see him, don't
open your mouth so wide.You have a habit--you open your mouth
and then you forget about it.MAURICE

_Blushing._

You are both looking at me and smiling._The sound of automobiles is heard._

JEANNE

_Rising quickly._

I think they are here.Maurice, this is only Count Clairmont,
don't forget.They will speak with you
about a very, very important matter, Emil, but you must not be
agitated.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, I know.JEANNE

_Kissing him quickly._

I am going._Exit, almost colliding with Silvina, who is excited._

MAURICE

_Whispering._

Who is it, Silvina?_Silvina makes some answer in mingled delight and awe.Maurice's
face assumes the same expression as Silvina's.Maurice walks quickly to the window and raises his left hand to
his forehead, straightening himself in military fashion.Thus he
stands until the others notice him._

_Enter Jeanne, Count Clairmont, followed by Secretary Lagard and
the Count's adjudant, an elderly General of stem appearance,
with numerous decorations upon his chest.The Count himself
is tall, well built and young, in a modest officer's uniform,
without any medals to signify his high station.He carries
himself very modestly, almost bashfully, but overcoming his
first uneasiness, he speaks warmly and powerfully and freely.All treat him with profound respect._

_Lagard is a strong old man with a leonine gray head.He speaks
simply, his gestures are calm and resolute.It is evident that
he is in the habit of speaking from a platform._

_Jeanne holds a large bouquet of flowers in her hands.Count
Clairmont walks directly toward Grelieu's bedside._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Confused._

I have come to shake hands with you, my dear master.Oh, but
do not make a single unnecessary movement, not a single one,
otherwise I shall be very unhappy!EMIL GRELIEU

I am deeply moved, I am happy.COUNT CLAIRMONT

No, no, don't speak that way.Here stands before you only a man
who has learned to think from your books.But see what they have
done to you--look, Lagard!LAGARD

How are you, Grelieu?I, too, want to shake your hand.Today I
am a Secretary by the will of Fate, but yesterday I was only a
physician, and I may congratulate you--you have a kind hand.GENERAL

_Coming forward modestly._

Allow me, too, in the name of this entire army of ours to
express to you our admiration, Monsieur Grelieu!EMIL GRELIEU

I thank you.COUNT CLAIRMONT

But perhaps it is necessary to have a surgeon?JEANNE

He can listen and talk, Count.COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Noticing Maurice, confused._

Oh!Please put down your hand--you are wounded.MAURICE

I am so happy, Count.JEANNE

This is our second son.Our first son, Pierre, was killed at
Liège--

COUNT CLAIRMONT

I dare not console you, Madame Grelieu.Give me your hand,
Maurice.I dare not--

COUNT CLAIRMONT

My dear young man, I, too, am nothing but a soldier now.My children and my wife
have sent you flowers--but where are they?JEANNE

Here they are, Count.COUNT CLAIRMONT

Thank you.But I did not know that your flowers were better than
mine, for my flowers smell of smoke._To Count Clairmont._

His pulse is good.Grelieu, we have come to you not only to
express our sympathy.Through me all the working people of
Belgium are shaking your hand.EMIL GRELIEU

I am proud of it, Lagard.LAGARD

But we are just as proud.Yes; there is something we must
discuss with you.Count Clairmont did not wish to disturb you,
but I said: "Let him die, but before that we must speak to him."EMIL GRELIEU

I am not dying.Maurice, I think you had better go out.COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Quickly._

Oh, no, no.He is your son, Grelieu, and he should be present to
hear what his father will say.Oh, I should have been proud to
have such a father.LAGARD

Our Count is a very fine young man--Pardon me, Count, I have
again upset our--

COUNT CLAIRMONT

That's nothing, I have already grown accustomed to it.Master,
it is necessary for you and your family to leave for Antwerp
today.EMIL GRELIEU

Are our affairs in such a critical condition?LAGARD

What is there to tell?That
horde of Huns is coming upon us like the tide of the sea.Today
they are still there, but tomorrow they will flood your house,
Grelieu.To what can we resort
in our defence?On this side are they, and there is the sea.Only very little is left of Belgium, Grelieu.Very soon there
will be no room even for my beard here.Dull sounds of cannonading are heard in the distance.All turn their eyes to the window._

EMIL GRELIEU

Is that a battle?COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Listening, calmly._

No, that is only the beginning.But tomorrow they will carry
their devilish weapons past your house.Do you know they are
real iron monsters, under whose weight our earth is quaking
and groaning.They are moving slowly, like amphibia that have
crawled out at night from the abyss--but they are moving!Another few days will pass, and they will crawl over to Antwerp,
they will turn their jaws to the city, to the churches--Woe to
Belgium, master!LAGARD

Yes, it is very bad.We are an honest and peaceful people
despising bloodshed, for war is such a stupid affair!And we
should not have had a single soldier long ago were it not for
this accursed neighbor, this den of murderers.GENERAL

And what would we have done without any soldiers, Monsieur
Lagard?LAGARD

And what can we do with soldiers, Monsieur General?COUNT CLAIRMONT

You are wrong, Lagard.With our little army there is still one
possibility--to die as freemen die.But without an army we would
have been bootblacks, Lagard!LAGARD

_Grumbling._

Well, I would not clean anybody's boots.Things are in bad
shape, Grelieu, in very bad shape.And there is but one remedy
left for us--.EMIL GRELIEU

I know.EMIL GRELIEU

The dam._Jeanne and Emil shudder and look at each other with terror in
their eyes._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

You shuddered, you are shuddering, madame.But what am I to do,
what are we to do, we who dare not shudder?JEANNE

Oh, I simply thought of a girl who was trying to find her way to
Lonua.She will never find her way to Lonua.COUNT CLAIRMONT

But what is to be done?The Count steps away to the window
and looks out, nervously twitching his mustaches.Maurice has
moved aside and, as before, stands at attention.Jeanne stands
a little distance away from him, with her shoulder leaning
against the wall, her beautiful pale head thrown back.Lagard is
sitting at the bedside as before, stroking his gray, disheveled
beard.The General is absorbed in gloomy thoughts._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Turning around resolutely._

I am a peaceful man, but I can understand why people take up
arms.That means a sword, a gun, explosive contrivances.Fire is killing people, but at the same time it
also gives light.There is something of the
ancient sacrifice in it.cold, dark, silent, covering
with mire, causing bodies to swell--water, which was the
beginning of chaos; water, which is guarding the earth by day
and night in order to rush upon it.My friend, believe me, I am
quite a daring man, but I am afraid of water!Lagard, what would
you say to that?LAGARD

We Belgians have too long been struggling against the water not
to have learned to fear it.JEANNE

But what is more terrible, the Prussians or water?GENERAL

_Bowing._

Madame is right.The Prussians are not more terrible, but they
are worse.It is terrible to release water
from captivity, the beast from its den, nevertheless it is a
better friend to us than the Prussians.I would prefer to see
the whole of Belgium covered with water rather than extend a
hand of reconciliation to a scoundrel!Neither they nor we shall
live to see that, even if the entire Atlantic Ocean rush over
our heads._Brief pause._

GENERAL

But I hope that we shall not come to that.Meanwhile it is
necessary for us to flood only part of our territory.JEANNE

_Her eyes closed, her head hanging down._

And what is to be done with those who could not abandon their
homes, who are deaf, who are sick and alone?_Silence._

JEANNE

There in the fields and in the ditches are the wounded.There
the shadows of people are wandering about, but in their veins
there is still warm blood.Oh, don't
look at me like that, Emil; you had better not listen to what I
am saying.I have spoken so only because my heart is wrung with
pain--it isn't necessary to listen to me at all, Count._Count Clairmont walks over to Grelieu's bed quickly and firmly.At first he speaks confusedly, seeking the right word; then he
speaks ever more boldly and firmly._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

My dear and honored master!We would not have dared to take
from you even a drop of your health, if--if it were not for the
assurance that serving your people may give new strength to your
heroic soul!Yesterday, it was resolved at our council to break
the dams and flood part of our kingdom, but I could not, I dared
not, give my full consent before I knew what you had to say to
this plan.I did not sleep all night long, thinking--oh, how
terrible, how inexpressibly sad my thoughts were!We are the
body, we are the hands, we are the head--while you, Grelieu, you
are the conscience of our people.Blinded by the war, we may
unwillingly, unwittingly, altogether against our will, violate
man-made laws.We are driven to despair, we have no Belgium any longer,
it is trampled by our enemies, but in your breast, Emil Grelieu,
the heart of all Belgium is beating--and your answer will be the
answer of our tormented, blood-stained, unfortunate land!Maurice is crying, looking at his
father._

LAGARD

_Softly._

Bravo, Belgium!The sound of cannonading is heard._

JEANNE

_Softly, to Maurice._

Sit down, Maurice, it is hard for you to stand.MAURICE

Oh, mamma!I am so happy to stand here now--

LAGARD

Now I shall add a few words.As you know, Grelieu, I am a man of
the people.I know the price the people pay for their hard work.I know the cost of all these gardens, orchards and factories
which we shall bury under the water.They have cost us sweat
and health and tears, Grelieu.These are our sufferings which
will be transformed into joy for our children.But as a nation
that loves and respects liberty above its sweat and blood and
tears--as a nation, I say, I would prefer that sea waves should
seethe here over our heads rather than that we should have to
black the boots of the Prussians.And if nothing but islands
remain of Belgium they will be known as "honest islands," and
the islanders will be Belgians as before._All are agitated._

EMIL GRELIEU

And what do the engineers say?GENERAL

_Respectfully waiting for the Count's answer._

Monsieur Grelieu, they say this can be done in two hours.LAGARD

_Grumbles._

In two hours!How many years have we been building
it!GENERAL

The engineers were crying when they said it, Monsieur.LAGARD

The engineers were crying?_Suddenly he bursts into sobs, and slowly takes a handkerchief
from his pocket._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

We are awaiting your answer impatiently, Grelieu.You are
charged with a grave responsibility to your fatherland--to lift
your hand against your own fatherland.EMIL GRELIEU Have we no other defence?Lagard dries
his eyes and slowly answers with a sigh_.JEANNE

_Shaking her head._

No.COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Rapidly._

We must gain time, Grelieu.By the power of all our lives,
thrown in the fields, we cannot stop them._Stamping his foot._

Time, time!We must steal from fate a small part of eternity--a
few days, a week!The Russians are
coming to us from the East.The German steel has already
penetrated to the heart of the French land--and infuriated with
pain, the French eagle is rising over the Germans' bayonets
and is coming toward us!The noble knights of the sea--the
British--are already rushing toward us, and to Belgium are their
powerful arms stretched out over the abyss.Belgium is praying for a few days, for
a few hours!You have already given to Belgium your blood,
Grelieu, and you have the right to lift your hand against your
blood-stained fatherland!_Brief pause._

EMIL GRELIEU

We must break the dams._Curtain_



SCENE V


_Night.A sentinel
on guard at the door leading to the rooms occupied by the
Commander of the army.Two officers on duty are
talking lazily, suffering apparently from the heat.Only from time to time the measured footsteps of
pickets are heard, and muffled voices and angry exclamations._

VON RITZAU

Do you feel sleepy, von Stein?VON STEIN

I don't feel sleepy, but I feel like smoking.RITZAU

A bad habit!STEIN

But what if _he_ should come in?Not a breath of pure air enters the lungs.The air is poisoned with the smell of smoke.We must invent
something against this obnoxious odor.RITZAU

I am not an inventor.First of all it is necessary to wring out
the air as they wring the clothes they wash, and dry it in the
sun.It is so moist, I feel as though I were diving in it.Do
you know whether _he_ is in a good mood today?STEIN

Why, is he subject to moods, good or bad?RITZAU

Great self-restraint!STEIN

Have you ever seen him undressed--or half-dressed?Or have you
ever seen his hair in disorder?RITZAU

He speaks so devilishly little, Stein.STEIN

He prefers to have his cannon speak.It is quite a powerful
voice, isn't it, Ritzau?A tall, handsome officer enters quickly and
goes toward the door leading to the room of the Commander._

Blumenfeld!_The tall officer waves his hand and opens the door cautiously,
ready to make his bow._

He is malting his career!RITZAU

He is a good fellow.STEIN

Would you rather be in Paris?RITZAU

I would prefer any less unbearable country to this.How dull it
must be here in the winter time.STEIN

But we have saved them from dullness for a long time to come.Were you ever in the Montmartre cafés, Ritzau?STEIN

Doesn't one find there a wonderful refinement, culture and
innate elegance?Unfortunately, our Berlin people are far
different.RITZAU

Oh, of course._The tall officer comes out of the door, stepping backward.He
heaves a sigh of relief and sits down near the two officers.Takes out a cigar._

VON BLUMENFELD How are things?STEIN

Then I am going to smoke too.BLUMENFELD

You may smoke.He is not coming out Do you want to hear
important news?BLUMENFELD He laughed just now I

STEIN

Really!BLUMENFELD

Upon my word of honor!And he touched my shoulder with two
fingers--do you understand?STEIN

_With envy._

Of course!I suppose you brought him good news, Blumenfeld?_The military telegraphist, standing at attention, hands
Blumenfeld a folded paper._

TELEGRAPHIST

A radiogram, Lieutenant!BLUMENFELD

Let me have it._Slowly he puts his cigar on the window sill and enters the
Commander's room cautiously._

STEIN

He's a lucky fellow.You may say what you please about luck,
but it exists.Von?--Did you know his
father?RITZAU

I have reason to believe that he had no grandfather at all._Blumenfeld comes out and rejoins the two officers, taking up
his cigar._

STEIN

Another military secret?BLUMENFELD

Of course.Everything that is said and done here is a military
secret.The information we have
received concerns our new siege guns--they are advancing
successfully.BLUMENFELD

Yes, successfully.They have just passed the most difficult part
of the road--you know where the swamps are--

STEIN

Oh, yes.BLUMENFELD

The road could not support the heavy weight and caved in.He ordered a report about the
movement at each and every kilometer.STEIN

Now he will sleep in peace.BLUMENFELD

He never sleeps, von Stein.BLUMENFELD

He never sleeps, von Stein!When he is not listening to
reports or issuing commands, he is thinking.As the personal
correspondent of his Highness I have the honor to know many
things which others are not allowed to know--Oh, gentlemen, he
has a wonderful mind!_Another very young officer enters, stands at attention before
Blumenfeld._

BLUMENFELD

Sit down, von Schauss.BLUMENFELD

He has a German philosophical mind which manages guns as
Leibnitz managed ideas.Everything is preconceived, everything
is prearranged, the movement of our millions of people has been
elaborated into such a remarkable system that Kant himself
would have been proud of it.Gentlemen, we are led forward by
indomitable logic and by an iron will._The officers express their approval by subdued exclamations of
"bravo."_

BLUMENFELD

How can he sleep, if the movement of our armies is but the
movement of parts of his brains!And what is the use of sleep
in general?I sleep very little myself, and I advise you,
gentlemen, not to indulge in foolish sleep.RITZAU

But our human organism requires sleep.BLUMENFELD

Nonsense!Organism--that is something invented by the doctors
who are looking for practice among the fools.I know only my desires and my will, which says:
"Gerhardt, do this!SCHAUSS

Will you permit me to take down your words in my notebook?BLUMENFELD

Please, Schauss._The telegraphist has entered._

ZIGLER

I really don't know, but something strange has happened.It
seems that we are being interfered with, I can't understand
anything.BLUMENFELD

What is it?ZIGLER

We can make out one word, "Water"--but after that all is
incomprehensible.And then again, "Water"--

BLUMENFELD

What water?ZIGLER

He is also surprised and cannot understand.BLUMENFELD

You are a donkey, Zigler!We'll have to call out--

_The Commander comes out.His voice is dry and unimpassioned._

COMMANDER

Blumenfeld!_All jump up, straighten themselves, as if petrified._

What is this?BLUMENFELD

I have not yet investigated it, your Highness.Zigler is
reporting--

COMMANDER

What is it, Zigler?ZIGLER

Your Highness, we are being interfered with.I don't know what
it is, but I can't understand anything.We have been able to
make out only one word--"Water."COMMANDER

_Turning around._

See what it is, Blumenfeld, and report to me--

_Engineer runs in._

ENGINEER

Where is Blumenfeld?COMMANDER

_Pausing._

What has happened there, Kloetz?ENGINEER

They don't respond to our calls, your Highness.COMMANDER

You think something serious has happened?ENGINEER

I dare not think so, your Highness, but I am alarmed.Silence is
the only answer to our most energetic calls._The second telegraphist has entered quietly._

GREITZER

They are silent, your Highness._Brief pause._

COMMANDER

_Again turning to the door._

Please investigate this, Lieutenant._He advances a step to the door, then stops.There is a
commotion behind the windows--a noise and the sound of voices.The noise keeps
growing, turning at times into a loud roar._

What is that?An officer, bareheaded, rushes in
excitedly, his hair disheveled, his face pale._

OFFICER

I want to see his Highness.BLUMENFELD

_Hissing._

You are insane!COMMANDER

Calm yourself, officer.I have the honor to report to you that the
Belgians have burst the dams, and our armies are flooded._With horror._

We must hurry, your Highness!OFFICER

They are flooded, your Highness.COMMANDER

Compose yourself, you are not behaving properly!I am asking you
about our field guns--

OFFICER

They are flooded, your Highness.We must hurry, your Highness, we are in a valley.They have broken the dams; and the water is
rushing this way violently.It is only five kilometers away from
here--and we can hardly--.The beginning of a terrible panic is felt,
embracing the entire camp.All watch impatiently the reddening
face of the Commander._

COMMANDER

But this is--

_He strikes the table with his fist forcibly._

Absurd!_He looks at them with cold fury, but all lower their eyes.The
frightened officer is trembling and gazing at the window.The
lights grow brighter outside--it is evident that a building has
been set on fire.A
dull noise, then the crash of shots is heard.The discipline is
disappearing gradually._

BLUMENFELD

They have gone mad!STEIN

But that can't be the Belgians!RITZAU

They may have availed themselves--

BLUMENFELD

Aren't you ashamed, Stein?I beg of you--

_Suddenly a piercing, wild sound of a horn is heard ordering to
retreat.The roaring sound is growing rapidly._

COMMANDER

_Shots._

Who has commanded to retreat?_Blumenfeld lowers his head._

COMMANDER

This is not the German Army!You are unworthy of being called
soldiers!BLUMENFELD

_Stepping forward, with dignity._

Your Highness!We are not fishes to swim in the water!_Runs out, followed by two or three others.The panic is
growing._

BLUMENFELD

Your Highness!Your life is in danger--your
Highness.Only the
sentinel remains in the position of one petrified._

BLUMENFELD

Your Highness!Your life--I am afraid that
another minute, and it will be too late!COMMANDER

But this is--

_Again strikes the table with his fist._

But this is absurd, Blumenfeld!_Curtain_



SCENE VI


_The same hour of night.In the darkness it is difficult to
discern the silhouettes of the ruined buildings and of the
trees.At the right, a half-destroyed bridge.From time to time the German flashlights are
seen across the dark sky.Near the bridge, an automobile in
which the wounded Emil Grelieu and his son are being carried to
Antwerp.Jeanne and a young physician are with them.Something
has broken down in the automobile and a soldier-chauffeur is
bustling about with a lantern trying to repair it.Langloi
stands near him._


DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

Well?CHAUFFEUR

_Examining._

I don't know yet.DOCTOR

Is it a serious break?CHAUFFEUR

No--I don't know.MAURICE

_From the automobile._

What is it, Doctor?CHAUFFEUR

_Angrily._

We'll start!DOCTOR

I don't know.MAURICE

Shall we stay here long?DOCTOR

_To the chauffeur._

Shall we stay here long?CHAUFFEUR

_Angrily._

How do I know?_Hands the lantern to the doctor._

MAURICE

Then I will come out.JEANNE

You had better stay here, Maurice.MAURICE

No, mother, I am careful._Jumps off and watches the chauffeur at work._

MAURICE

How unfortunate that we are stuck here!CHAUFFEUR

_Grumbling._

A bridge!DOCTOR

Yes, it is unfortunate.MAURICE

_Shrugging his shoulders._

Father did not want to leave.Mamina, do
you think our people are already in Antwerp?JEANNE

Yes, I think so.EMIL GRELIEU

No.It is very pleasant to breathe the fresh air.DOCTOR

_To Maurice._

I think we are still in the region which--

MAURICE

Yes.DOCTOR

_Looking at his watch._

Twenty--a quarter of ten.MAURICE

Then it is a quarter of an hour since the bursting of the dams.Mamma, do you hear, it is a quarter of ten now!JEANNE

Yes, I hear.MAURICE

But it is strange that we haven't heard any explosions.DOCTOR

How can you say that, Monsieur Maurice?MAURICE

I thought that such explosions would be heard a hundred
kilometers away.Our house and our
garden will soon be flooded!I wonder how high the water will
rise.Do you think it will reach up to the second story?CHAUFFEUR

_Grumbling._

I am working.Mamma, see how the searchlights are working.EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne, lift me a little.JEANNE

My dear, I don't know whether I am allowed to do it.DOCTOR

You may lift him a little, if it isn't very painful.JEANNE

Do you feel any pain?EMIL GRELIEU

No.MAURICE

Father, they are flashing the searchlights across the sky like
madmen._A bluish light is flashed over them, faintly illuminating the
whole group._

MAURICE

Right into my eyes!EMIL GRELIEU

I suppose so.Either they have been warned, or the water is
reaching them by this time.JEANNE

Do you think so, Emil?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.It seems to me that I hear the sound of the water from that
side._All listen and look in the direction from which the noise came._

DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

How unpleasant this is!MAURICE

Father, it seems to me I hear voices.Listen--it sounds as
though they are crying there.Father, the
Prussians are crying._A distant, dull roaring of a crowd is heard.The searchlights are
swaying from side to side._

EMIL GRELIEU

It is they.DOCTOR

If we don't start in a quarter of an hour--

EMIL GRELIEU

In half an hour, Doctor.MAURICE

Father, how beautiful and how terrible it is!JEANNE

What is it?MAURICE

I want to kiss it.JEANNE

What a foolish little boy you are, Maurice.MAURICE

Monsieur Langloi said that in three days from now I may remove
my bandage.Just think of it, in three days I shall be able to
take up my gun again!...The
chauffeur and the doctor draw their revolvers.A figure appears
from the field, approaching from one of the ditches.A peasant,
wounded in the leg, comes up slowly, leaning upon a cane._

MAURICE

Who is there?PEASANT

Our own, our own.MAURICE

Yes, we're going to the city.Our car has broken down, we're
repairing it.PEASANT

What am I doing here?They also look at him
attentively, by the light of the lantern._

CHAUFFEUR

Give me the light!PEASANT

Are you carrying a wounded man?I
cannot walk, it is very hard.I lay there in the ditch and when I heard you
speak French I crawled out.DOCTOR

How were you wounded?PEASANT

I was walking in the field and they shot me.They must have
thought I was a rabbit._Laughs hoarsely._

They must have thought I was a rabbit.What is the news,
gentlemen?MAURICE

Don't you know?PEASANT

What can I know?I lay there and looked at the sky--that's all I
know.Just look at it, I have been watching
it all the time.What is that I see in the sky, eh?EMIL GRELIEU

Sit down near us.MAURICE

Listen, sit down here.They are
crying there--the Prussians!They must have learned of
it by this time.Listen, it is so far, and yet we can hear!_The peasant laughs hoarsely._

MAURICE

Sit down, right here, the automobile is large.CHAUFFEUR

_Muttering._

Sit down, sit down!DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

What is it?MAURICE

What an unfortunate mishap!JEANNE

_Agitated._

They shot you like a rabbit?Do you hear, Emil--they thought a
rabbit was running!_She laughs loudly, the peasant also laughs._

PEASANT

I look like a rabbit!JEANNE

Do you hear, Emil?_Laughs._

EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne!JEANNE

It makes me laugh--it seems so comical to me that they mistake
us for rabbits.And now, what are we now--water rats?Emil, just
picture to yourself, water rats in an automobile!JEANNE

No, no, I am not laughing any more, Maurice!_Laughs._

And what else are we?PEASANT

_Laughs._

And now we must hide in the ground--

JEANNE

_In the same tone._

And they will remain on the ground?EMIL GRELIEU

My dear!MAURICE

_To the doctor._

Listen, you must do something.Mamma, we are starting directly, my dear!JEANNE

No, never mind, I am not laughing any more.Maurice, I simply felt like talking.I
was forever silent, but just now I felt like chattering.Emil,
I am not disturbing you with my talk, am I?Why is the water so
quiet, Emil?It was the King who said, "The water is silent,"
was it not?But I should like to see it roar, crash like
thunder.... No, I cannot, I cannot bear this silence!Ah, why is
it so quiet--I cannot bear it!MAURICE

_To the chauffeur._

My dear fellow, please hurry up!CHAUFFEUR

Yes, yes!JEANNE

_Suddenly cries, threatening._

But I cannot bear it!_Covers her mouth with her hands; sobs._

I cannot!EMIL GRELIEU

All will end well, Jeanne.JEANNE

_Sobbing, but calming herself somewhat._

I cannot bear it!EMIL GRELIEU

All will end well, Jeanne!I am suffering, but I know this, Jeanne!CHAUFFEUR

In a moment, in a moment.EMIL GRELIEU

_Faintly._

Jeanne!JEANNE

Yes, yes, I know.... Forgive me, forgive me, I will soon--

_A loud, somewhat hoarse voice of a girl comes from the dark._

GIRL

Tell me how I can find my way to Lonua!_Exclamations of surprise._

MAURICE

Who is that?JEANNE

Emil, it is that girl!_Laughs._

She is also like a rabbit!DOCTOR

_Grumbles._

What is it, what is it--Who?Her dress is torn, her eyes look
wild.The peasant is laughing._

PEASANT

She is here again?CHAUFFEUR

Let me have the light!GIRL

_Loudly._

How can I find my way to Lonua?EMIL GRELIEU

Maurice, you must stop her!Doctor, you--

CHAUFFEUR

Put down the lantern!GIRL

_Shouts._

Hands off!No, no, you will not dare--

MAURICE

You can't catch her--

_The girl runs away._

EMIL GRELIEU

Doctor, you must catch her!She will perish here, quick--

_She runs away.The doctor follows her in the dark._

PEASANT

She asked me, too, how to go to Lonua._The girl's voice resounds in the dark and then there is
silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

You must catch her!MAURICE

But how, father?Jeanne
breaks into muffled laughter._

MAURICE

_Mutters._

Now he is gone!CHAUFFEUR

_Triumphantly._

Take your seats!MAURICE

But the doctor isn't here.CHAUFFEUR

Let us call him._Maurice and the chauffeur call: "Doctor!"_

CHAUFFEUR

_Angrily._

I must deliver Monsieur Grelieu, and I will deliver him.MAURICE

_Shouts._

Langloi!_A faint echo in the distance._

Come!_The response is nearer._

PEASANT

He did not catch her.She asked me, too,
about the road to Lonua._Laughs._

There are many like her now.EMIL GRELIEU

_Imploringly._

Jeanne!JEANNE

But I cannot, Emil.I used
to understand, I used to understand, but now--Where is Pierre?_Firmly._

Where is Pierre?MAURICE

Oh, will he be here soon?Mother dear, we'll start in a moment!JEANNE

Yes, yes, we'll start in a moment!Why such a dream, why such a dream?_A mice from the darkness, quite near._

JEANNE

_Frightened._

Who is shouting?What a strange dream, what a terrible,
terrible, terrible dream._Lowering her voice._

I cannot--why are you torturing me?EMIL GRELIEU

He is dead, Jeanne!EMIL GRELIEU

He is dead, Jeanne.But I swear to you by God, Jeanne!--Belgium
will live.Weep, sob, you are a mother.I too am crying with
you--But I swear by God: Belgium will live!God has given me the
light to see, and I can see.A new Spring will come here, the trees will be covered with
blossoms--I swear to you, Jeanne, they will be covered with
blossoms!And mothers will caress their children, and the sun
will shine upon their heads, upon their golden-haired little
heads!I see my nation: Here it is advancing with palm
leaves to meet God who has come to earth again.Weep, Jeanne,
you are a mother!Weep, unfortunate mother--God weeps with you.But there will be happy mothers here again--I see a new world,
Jeanne, I see a new life!--
    "'Tis Blanche of Devan," Murdoch said,
    "A crazed and captive Lowland maid,
    Ta'en on the morn she was a bride,
    When Roderick foray'd Devan-side;
    The gay bridegroom resistance made,
    And felt our Chief's unconquer'd blade.I marvel she is now at large,
    But oft she'scapes from Maudlin's charge.--
    Hence, brain-sick fool!"--He raised his bow:--
    "Now, if thou strikest her but one blow,
    I'll pitch thee from the cliff as far
    As ever peasant pitch'd a bar!"[264]--
    "Thanks, champion, thanks!"the maniac cried,
    And press'd her to Fitz-James's side."See the gray pennons I prepare,
    To seek my true love through the air!I will not lend that savage groom,
    To break his fall, one downy plume!No!--deep amid disjointed stones,
    The wolves shall batten[265] on his bones,
    And then shall his detested plaid,
    By bush and brier in mid air stayed,
    Wave forth a banner fair and free,
    Meet signal for their revelry."--

[264] "Pitching the bar" was a favorite athletic sport in Scotland."Hush thee, poor maiden, and be still!"thou look'st kindly, and I will.--
    Mine eye has dried and wasted been,
    But still it loves the Lincoln green;
    And, though mine ear is all unstrung,
    Still, still it loves the Lowland tongue."For oh my sweet William was forester true,
      He stole poor Blanche's heart away!His coat it was all of the greenwood hue,
      And so blithely he trill'd the Lowland lay!"It was not that I meant to tell...
    But thou art wise, and guessest well."Then, in a low and broken tone,
    And hurried note, the song went on.Still on the Clansman, fearfully,
    She fixed her apprehensive eye;
    Then turn'd it on the Knight, and then
    Her look glanced wildly o'er the glen."The toils are pitch'd, and the stakes are set,
      Ever sing merrily, merrily;
    The bows they bend, and the knives they whet,
      Hunters live so cheerily."It was a stag, a stag of ten,[266]
      Bearing its branches sturdily;
    He came stately down the glen,
      Ever sing hardily, hardily."It was there he met with a wounded doe,
      She was bleeding deathfully;
    She warn'd him of the toils below,
      Oh, so faithfully, faithfully!"He had an eye, and he could heed,
      Ever sing warily, warily;
    He had a foot, and he could speed--
      Hunters watch so narrowly."[267]

[266] Having antlers with ten branches.[267] "The hunters are Clan-Alpine's men; the stag of ten is
Fitz-James; the wounded doe is herself!"Fitz-James's mind was passion-toss'd,
    When Ellen's hints and fears were lost;
    But Murdoch's shout suspicion wrought,
    And Blanche's song conviction brought.--
    Not like a stag that spies the snare,
    But lion of the hunt aware,
    He waved at once his blade on high,
    "Disclose thy treachery, or die!"Forth at full speed the Clansman flew,
    But in his race his bow he drew.The shaft just grazed Fitz-James's crest,
    And thrill'd in Blanche's faded breast.--
    Murdoch of Alpine!prove thy speed,
    For ne'er had Alpine's son such need!With heart of fire, and foot of wind,
    The fierce avenger is behind!Fate judges of the rapid strife--
    The forfeit[268] death--the prize is life!Thy kindred ambush lies before,
    Close couch'd upon the heathery moor;
    Them couldst thou reach!--it may not be--
    Thine ambush'd kin thou ne'er shalt see,
    The fiery Saxon gains on thee!--Resistless speeds the deadly thrust,
    As lightning strikes the pine to dust;
    With foot and hand Fitz-James must strain,
    Ere he can win his blade again.Bent o'er the fall'n, with falcon eye,
    He grimly smiled to see him die;
    Then slower wended back his way,
    Where the poor maiden bleeding lay.She sate beneath the birchen tree,
    Her elbow resting on her knee;
    She had withdrawn the fatal shaft,
    And gazed on it, and feebly laugh'd;
    Her wreath of broom and feathers gray,
    Daggled[269] with blood, beside her lay.The Knight to stanch the life-stream tried,--
    "Stranger, it is in vain!""This hour of death has given me more
    Of reason's power than years before;
    For, as these ebbing veins decay,
    My frenzied visions fade away.A helpless injured wretch I die,
    And something tells me in thine eye,
    That thou wert mine avenger born.--
    Seest thou this tress?--Oh!still I've worn
    This little tress of yellow hair,
    Through danger, frenzy, and despair!It once was bright and clear as thine,
    But blood and tears have dimm'd its shine.I will not tell thee when 'twas shred,
    Nor from what guiltless victim's head--
    My brain would turn!--but it shall wave
    Like plumage on thy helmet brave,
    Till sun and wind shall bleach the stain,
    And thou wilt bring it me again.--
    I waver still.--O God!more bright
    Let reason beam her parting light!--
    Oh!by thy knighthood's honor'd sign,
    And for thy life preserved by mine,
    When thou shalt see a darksome man,
    Who boasts him Chief of Alpine's Clan,
    With tartans broad, and shadowy plume,
    And hand of blood, and brow of gloom,
    Be thy heart bold, thy weapon strong,
    And wreak[270] poor Blanche of Devan's wrong!They watch for thee by pass and fell...
    Avoid the path... O God!...A kindly heart had brave Fitz-James;
    Fast pour'd his eyes at pity's claims;
    And now with mingled grief and ire,
    He saw the murder'd maid expire."God, in my need, be my relief,
    As I wreak this on yonder Chief!"A lock from Blanche's tresses fair
    He blended with her bridegroom's hair;
    The mingled braid in blood he dyed,
    And placed it on his bonnet-side:
    "By Him whose word is truth!I swear,
    No other favor will I wear,
    Till this sad token I imbrue
    In the best blood of Roderick Dhu.The chase is up,--but they shall know,
    The stag at bay's a dangerous foe."Barr'd from the known but guarded way,
    Through copse and cliffs Fitz-James must stray,
    And oft must change his desperate track,
    By stream and precipice turn'd back.Heartless, fatigued, and faint, at length,
    From lack of food and loss of strength,
    He couch'd him in a thicket hoar,
    And thought his toils and perils o'er:--
    "Of all my rash adventures past,
    This frantic feat must prove the last!Who e'er so mad but might have guess'd,
    That all this Highland hornet's nest
    Would muster up in swarms so soon
    As e'er they heard of bands[271] at Doune?Like bloodhounds now they search me out,--
    Hark, to the whistle and the shout!--
    If farther through the wilds I go,
    I only fall upon the foe:
    I'll couch me here till evening gray,
    Then darkling try my dangerous way."The shades of eve come slowly down,
    The woods are wrapt in deeper brown,
    The owl awakens from her dell,
    The fox is heard upon the fell;
    Enough remains of glimmering light
    To guide the wanderer's steps aright,
    Yet not enough from far to show
    His figure to the watchful foe.With cautious step, and ear awake,
    He climbs the crag and threads the brake;
    And not the summer solstice,[272] there,
    Temper'd the midnight mountain air,
    But every breeze, that swept the wold,
    Benumb'd his drenched limbs with cold.In dread, in danger, and alone,
    Famish'd and chill'd, through ways unknown,
    Tangled and steep, he journey'd on;
    Till, as a rock's huge point he turn'd,
    A watch fire close before him burn'd.Beside its embers red and clear,
    Bask'd, in his plaid, a mountaineer;
    And up he sprung with sword in hand,--
    "Thy name and purpose?--
    "Rest and a guide, and food and fire.My life's beset, my path is lost,
    The gale has chill'd my limbs with frost."--
    "Art thou a friend to Roderick?"--"No."--
    "Thou darest not call thyself a foe?"to him and all the band
    He brings to aid his murderous hand."--
    "Bold words!--but, though the beast of game
    The privilege of chase may claim,
    Though space and law the stag we lend,
    Ere hound we slip,[273] or bow we bend,
    Who ever reck'd, where, how, or when,
    The prowling fox was trapp'd or slain?Thus treacherous scouts,--yet sure they lie,
    Who say them earnest a secret spy!"--
    "They do, by Heaven!--Come Roderick Dhu,
    And of his clan the boldest two,
    And let me but till morning rest,
    I write the falsehood on their crest."--
    "If by the blaze I mark aright,
    Thou bear'st the belt and spur of Knight."--
    "Then by these tokens mayest thou know
    Each proud oppressor's mortal foe."--
    "Enough, enough;--sit down, and share
    A soldier's couch, a soldier's fare."He gave him of his Highland cheer,
    The harden'd flesh of mountain deer;
    Dry fuel on the fire he laid,
    And bade the Saxon share his plaid.He tended him like welcome guest,
    Then thus his farther speech address'd:--
    "Stranger, I am to Roderick Dhu
    A clansman born, a kinsman true;
    Each word against his honor spoke,
    Demands of me avenging stroke;
    Yet more, upon thy fate, 'tis said,
    A mighty augury[274] is laid.It rests with me to wind my horn,--
    Thou art with numbers overborne;
    It rests with me, here, brand to brand,
    Worn as thou art, to bid thee stand:
    But, not for clan, nor kindred's cause,
    Will I depart from honor's laws;
    To assail a wearied man were shame,
    And stranger is a holy name;
    Guidance and rest, and food and fire,
    In vain he never must require.Then rest thee here till dawn of day;
    Myself will guide thee on the way,
    O'er stock and stone, through watch and ward,
    Till past Clan-Alpine's utmost guard,
    As far as Coilantogle's ford;
    From thence thy warrant[275] is thy sword."--
    "I take thy courtesy, by Heaven,
    As freely as 'tis nobly given!"--
    "Well, rest thee; for the bittern's cry
    Sings us the lake's wild lullaby."With that he shook the gather'd heath,
    And spread his plaid upon the wreath;
    And the brave foemen, side by side,
    Lay peaceful down, like brothers tried,
    And slept until the dawning beam
    Purpled the mountain and the stream.I.

    Fair as the earliest beam of eastern light,
        When first, by the bewilder'd pilgrim spied,
    It smiles upon the dreary brow of night,
        And silvers o'er the torrent's foaming tide,
    And lights the fearful path on mountain side;--
      Fair as that beam, although the fairest far,
    Giving to horror grace, to danger pride,
      Shine martial Faith, and Courtesy's bright star,
    Through all the wreckful storms that cloud the brow of War.That early beam, so fair and sheen,
    Was twinkling through the hazel screen,
    When, rousing at its glimmer red,
    The warriors left their lowly bed,
    Look'd out upon the dappled sky,
    Mutter'd their soldier matins by,
    And then awaked their fire, to steal,[276]
    As short and rude, their soldier meal.That o'er, the Gael around him threw
    His graceful plaid of varied hue,
    And, true to promise, led the way,
    By thicket green and mountain gray.A wildering path!--they winded now
    Along the precipice's brow,
    Commanding the rich scenes beneath,
    The windings of the Forth and Teith,
    And all the vales beneath that lie,
    Till Stirling's turrets melt in sky;
    Then, sunk in copse, their farthest glance
    Gain'd not the length of horseman's lance
    'Twas oft so steep, the foot was fain
    Assistance from the hand to gain;
    So tangled oft, that, bursting through,
    Each hawthorn shed her showers of dew,--
    That diamond dew, so pure and clear,
    It rivals all but Beauty's tear!At length they came where, stern and steep,
    The hill sinks down upon the deep.Here Vennachar in silver flows,
    There, ridge on ridge, Benledi rose;
    Ever the hollow path twined on,
    Beneath steep bank and threatening stone;
    An hundred men might hold the post
    With hardihood against a host.The rugged mountain's scanty cloak
    Was dwarfish shrubs of birch and oak,
    With shingles[277] bare, and cliffs between,
    And patches bright of bracken green,
    And heather black, that waved so high,
    It held the copse in rivalry.But where the lake slept deep and still,
    Dank[278] osiers fringed the swamp and hill;
    And oft both path and hill were torn,
    Where wintry torrent down had borne,
    And heap'd upon the cumber'd land
    Its wreck of gravel, rocks, and sand.So toilsome was the road to trace,
    The guide, abating of his pace,
    Led slowly through the pass's jaws,
    And ask'd Fitz-James, by what strange cause
    He sought these wilds, traversed by few,
    Without a pass from Roderick Dhu."Brave Gael, my pass in danger tried,
    Hangs in my belt, and by my side;
    Yet, sooth to tell," the Saxon said,
    "I dreamt not now to claim its aid.When here, but three days since, I came,
    Bewilder'd in pursuit of game,
    All seem'd as peaceful and as still
    As the mist slumbering on yon hill;
    Thy dangerous Chief was then afar,
    Nor soon expected back from war.Thus said, at least, my mountain guide,
    Though deep, perchance, the villain lied."--
    "Yet why a second venture try?"--
    "A warrior thou, and ask me why!--
    Moves our free course by such fix'd cause
    As gives the poor mechanic laws?Enough, I sought to drive away
    The lazy hours of peaceful day;
    Slight cause will then suffice to guide
    A Knight's free footsteps far and wide,--
    A falcon flown, a greyhound stray'd,
    The merry glance of mountain maid:
    Or, if a path be dangerous known,
    The danger's self is lure alone.""Thy secret keep, I urge thee not;--
    Yet, ere again ye sought this spot,
    Say, heard ye naught of Lowland war,
    Against Clan-Alpine, raised by Mar?"--"No, by my word;--of bands prepared
    To guard King James's sports I heard;
    Nor doubt I aught, but, when they hear
    This muster of the mountaineer,
    Their pennons will abroad be flung,
    Which else in Doune had peaceful hung."--
    "Free be they flung!--for we were loth
    Their silken folds should feast the moth.Free be they flung!--as free shall wave
    Clan-Alpine's pine in banner brave.But, Stranger, peaceful since you came,
    Bewilder'd in the mountain game,
    Whence the bold boast by which you show[279]
    Vich-Alpine's vow'd and mortal foe?"--
    "Warrior, but yester-morn, I knew
    Naught of thy Chieftain, Roderick Dhu,
    Save as an outlaw'd desperate man,
    The chief of a rebellious clan,
    Who, in the Regent's[280] court and sight,
    With ruffian dagger stabb'd a knight:
    Yet this alone might from his part
    Sever each true and loyal heart."[280] Duke of Albany (see Introduction, p.Wrothful at such arraignment foul,
    Dark lower'd the clansman's sable scowl.A space he paused, then sternly said,
    "And heardst thou why he drew his blade?Heardst thou, that shameful word and blow
    Brought Roderick's vengeance on his foe?What reck'd the Chieftain if he stood
    On Highland heath, or Holy-Rood?He rights such wrong where it is given,
    If it were in the court of heaven."--
    "Still was it outrage;--yet, 'tis true,
    Not then claim'd sovereignty his due;
    While Albany, with feeble hand,
    Held borrow'd truncheon of command,
    The young King, mew'd[281] in Stirling tower,
    Was stranger to respect and power.[282]
    But then, thy Chieftain's robber life!--
    Winning mean prey by causeless strife,
    Wrenching from ruin'd Lowland swain
    His herds and harvest rear'd in vain.--
    Methinks a soul, like thine, should scorn
    The spoils from such foul foray borne."[282] That period of Scottish history from the battle of Flodden to the
majority of James V. was full of disorder and violence.The Gael beheld him grim the while,
    And answer'd with disdainful smile,--
    "Saxon, from yonder mountain high,
    I mark'd thee send delighted eye,
    Far to the south and east, where lay,
    Extended in succession gay,
    Deep waving fields and pastures green,
    With gentle <DW72>s and groves between:--
    These fertile plains, that soften'd vale,
    Were once the birthright of the Gael;
    The stranger came with iron hand,
    And from our fathers reft[283] the land.See, rudely swell
    Crag over crag, and fell o'er fell.Ask we this savage hill we tread,
    For fatten'd steer or household bread;
    Ask we for flocks these shingles dry,--
    And well the mountain might reply,
    'To you, as to your sires of yore,
    Belong the target and claymore!I give you shelter in my breast,
    Your own good blades must win the rest.'Pent in this fortress of the north,
    Thinkst thou we will not sally forth,
    To spoil the spoiler as we may,
    And from the robber rend the prey?Ay, by my soul!--While on yon plain
    The Saxon rears one shock of grain;
    While, of ten thousand herds, there strays
    But one along yon river's maze,--
    The Gael, of plain and river heir,
    Shall, with strong hand, redeem his share.Where live the mountain Chiefs who hold,
    That plundering Lowland field and fold
    Is aught but retribution true?Seek other cause 'gainst Roderick Dhu."Answer'd Fitz-James,--"And, if I sought,
    Thinkst thou no other could be brought?What deem ye of my path waylaid?My life given o'er to ambuscade?"--
    "As of a meed to rashness due:
    Hadst thou sent warning fair and true,--
    I seek my hound, or falcon stray'd,
    I seek, good faith,[284] a Highland maid,--
    Free hadst thou been to come and go;
    But secret path marks secret foe.Nor yet, for this, even as a spy,
    Hadst thou, unheard, been doom'd to die,
    Save to fulfill an augury."--
    "Well, let it pass; nor will I now
    Fresh cause of enmity avow,
    To chafe thy mood and cloud thy brow.Enough, I am by promise tied
    To match me with this man of pride:
    Twice have I sought Clan-Alpine's glen
    In peace; but when I come agen,
    I come with banner, brand, and bow,
    As leader seeks his mortal foe.For lovelorn swain, in lady's bower,
    Ne'er panted for the appointed hour,
    As I, until before me stand
    This rebel Chieftain and his band!"--

[284] "Good faith," i.e., in good faith.--He whistled shrill,
    And he was answer'd from the hill;
    Wild as the scream of the curlew,
    From crag to crag the signal flew.Instant, through copse and heath, arose
    Bonnets and spears and bended bows;
    On right, on left, above, below,
    Sprung up at once the lurking foe;
    From shingles gray their lances start,
    The bracken bush sends forth the dart,
    The rushes and the willow wand
    Are bristling into ax and brand,
    And every tuft of broom gives life
    To plaided warrior arm'd for strife.That whistle garrison'd the glen
    At once with full five hundred men,
    As if the yawning hill to heaven
    A subterranean host had given.Watching their leader's beck and will,
    All silent there they stood, and still.Like the loose crags, whose threatening mass
    Lay tottering o'er the hollow pass,
    As if an infant's touch could urge
    Their headlong passage down the verge,
    With step and weapon forward flung,
    Upon the mountain side they hung.The Mountaineer cast glance of pride
    Along Benledi's living side,
    Then fix'd his eye and sable brow
    Full on Fitz-James--"How say'st thou now?These are Clan-Alpine's warriors true;
    And, Saxon,--I am Roderick Dhu!"X.

    Fitz-James was brave:--Though to his heart
    The lifeblood thrill'd with sudden start,
    He mann'd himself with dauntless air,
    Return'd the Chief his haughty stare,
    His back against a rock he bore,
    And firmly placed his foot before:--
    "Come one, come all!this rock shall fly
    From its firm base as soon as I."Sir Roderick mark'd--and in his eyes
    Respect was mingled with surprise,
    And the stern joy which warriors feel
    In foemen worthy of their steel.Short space he stood--then waved his hand:
    Down sunk the disappearing band;
    Each warrior vanish'd where he stood,
    In broom or bracken, heath or wood;
    Sunk brand and spear and bended bow,
    In osiers pale and copses low;
    It seem'd as if their mother Earth
    Had swallowed up her warlike birth.The wind's last breath had toss'd in air
    Pennon, and plaid, and plumage fair,--
    The next but swept a lone hillside,
    Where heath and fern were waving wide:
    The sun's last glance was glinted[285] back,
    From spear and glaive, from targe and jack,--
    The next, all unreflected, shone
    On bracken green, and cold gray stone.Fitz-James look'd round--yet scarce believed
    The witness that his sight received;
    Such apparition well might seem
    Delusion of a dreadful dream.Sir Roderick in suspense he eyed,
    And to his look the Chief replied,
    "Fear naught--nay, that I need not say--
    But--doubt not aught from mine array.Thou art my guest;--I pledged my word
    As far as Coilantogle ford:
    Nor would I call a clansman's brand
    For aid against one valiant hand,
    Though on our strife lay every vale
    Rent by the Saxon from the Gael.So move we on;--I only meant
    To show the reed on which you leant,
    Deeming this path you might pursue
    Without a pass from Roderick Dhu."They mov'd:--I said Fitz-James was brave,
    As ever knight that belted glaive;
    Yet dare not say, that now his blood
    Kept on its wont and temper'd flood,[286]
    As, following Roderick's stride, he drew
    That seeming lonesome pathway through,
    Which yet, by fearful proof, was rife
    With lances, that, to take his life,
    Waited but signal from a guide
    So late dishonor'd and defied.Ever, by stealth, his eye sought round
    The vanish'd guardians of the ground,
    And still, from copse and heather deep,
    Fancy saw spear and broadsword peep,
    And in the plover's shrilly strain,
    The signal-whistle heard again.Nor breathed he free till far behind
    The pass was left; for then they wind
    Along a wide and level green,
    Where neither tree nor tuft was seen,
    Nor rush nor bush of broom was near,
    To hide a bonnet or a spear.The Chief in silence strode before,
    And reach'd that torrent's sounding shore,
    Which, daughter of three mighty lakes,[287]
    From Vennachar in silver breaks,
    Sweeps through the plain, and ceaseless mines
    On Bochastle the moldering lines,
    Where Rome, the Empress of the world,
    Of yore her eagle[288] wings unfurl'd.And here his course the Chieftain stayed,
    Threw down his target and his plaid,
    And to the Lowland warrior said,--
    "Bold Saxon!to his promise just,
    Vich-Alpine has discharged his trust.This murderous Chief, this ruthless man,
    This head of a rebellious clan,
    Hath led thee safe, through watch and ward,
    Far past Clan-Alpine's outmost guard.Now, man to man, and steel to steel,
    A Chieftain's vengeance thou shalt feel.See here, all vantageless[289] I stand,
    Arm'd, like thyself, with single brand:
    For this is Coilantogle ford,
    And thou must keep thee with thy sword."[287] Katrine, Achray, and Vennachar.[288] The eagle, with wings displayed and a thunderbolt in one of its
talons, was the ensign of the Roman legions.Ancient earthworks near
Bochastle are thought to date back to the Roman occupation of Britain.The Saxon paused:--"I ne'er delay'd
    When foeman bade me draw my blade;
    Nay, more, brave Chief, I vow'd thy death:
    Yet sure thy fair and generous faith,
    And my deep debt for life preserv'd,
    A better meed have well deserv'd:
    Can naught but blood our feud atone?And hear,--to fire thy flagging zeal,--
    The Saxon cause rests on thy steel;
    For thus spoke Fate, by prophet bred
    Between the living and the dead:
    'Who spills the foremost foeman's life,
    His party conquers in the strife.'"--
    "Then, by my word," the Saxon said,
    "The riddle is already read.Seek yonder brake beneath the cliff,--
    There lies Red Murdoch, stark and stiff.Thus Fate hath solved her prophecy,
    Then yield to Fate, and not to me.To James, at Stirling, let us go,
    When, if thou wilt be still his foe,
    Or if the King shall not agree
    To grant thee grace and favor free,[290]
    I plight mine honor, oath, and word,
    That, to thy native strengths[291] restored,
    With each advantage shalt thou stand,
    That aids thee now to guard thy land."Dark lightning flash'd from Roderick's eye--
    "Soars thy presumption, then, so high,
    Because a wretched kern ye slew,
    Homage to name to Roderick Dhu?He yields not, he, to man nor Fate!Thou add'st but fuel to my hate:--
    My clansman's blood demands revenge.Not yet prepared?--By Heaven, I change
    My thought, and hold thy valor light
    As that of some vain carpet knight,
    Who ill deserved my courteous care,
    And whose best boast is but to wear
    A braid of his fair lady's hair."--
    "I thank thee, Roderick, for the word!It nerves my heart, it steels my sword;
    For I have sworn this braid to stain
    In the best blood that warms thy vein.and, ruth, begone!--
    Yet think not that by thee alone,
    Proud Chief!can courtesy be shown;
    Though not from copse, or heath, or cairn,
    Start at my whistle clansmen stern,
    Of this small horn one feeble blast
    Would fearful odds against thee cast.But fear not--doubt not--which thou wilt--
    We try this quarrel hilt to hilt."--
    Then each at once his falchion drew,
    Each on the ground his scabbard threw,
    Each look'd to sun, and stream, and plain,
    As what they ne'er might see again;
    Then foot, and point, and eye opposed,
    In dubious strife they darkly closed.Ill fared it then with Roderick Dhu,
    That on the field his targe he threw,
    Whose brazen studs and tough bull hide
    Had death so often dash'd aside;
    For, train'd abroad[292] his arms to wield,
    Fitz-James's blade was sword and shield.He practiced every pass and ward,
    To thrust, to strike, to feint, to guard;
    While less expert, though stronger far,
    The Gael maintain'd unequal war.Three times in closing strife they stood,
    And thrice the Saxon blade drank blood;
    No stinted draught, no scanty tide,
    The gushing flood the tartans dyed.Fierce Roderick felt the fatal drain,
    And shower'd his blows like wintry rain;
    And, as firm rock, or castle roof,
    Against the winter shower is proof,
    The foe, invulnerable still,
    Foil'd his wild rage by steady skill;
    Till, at advantage ta'en, his brand
    Forced Roderick's weapon from his hand,
    And backward borne upon the lea,
    Brought the proud Chieftain to his knee."Now, yield thee, or by Him who made
    The world, thy heart's blood dyes my blade!"--
    "Thy threats, thy mercy, I defy!Let recreant yield, who fears to die."--Like adder darting from his coil,
    Like wolf that dashes through the toil,
    Like mountain cat who guards her young,
    Full at Fitz-James's throat he sprung;
    Received, but reck'd not of a wound,
    And lock'd his arms his foeman round.--
    Now, gallant Saxon, hold thine own!That desperate grasp thy frame might feel,
    Through bars of brass and triple steel!--
    They tug, they strain!down, down they go,
    The Gael above, Fitz-James below.The Chieftain's gripe his throat compress'd,
    His knee was planted in his breast;
    His clotted locks he backward threw,
    Across his brow his hand he drew,
    From blood and mist to clear his sight,
    Then gleam'd aloft his dagger bright!--
    --But hate and fury ill supplied
    The stream of life's exhausted tide,
    And all too late the advantage came,
    To turn the odds of deadly game;
    For, while the dagger gleam'd on high,
    Reel'd soul and sense, reel'd brain and eye.but in the heath
    The erring blade found bloodless sheath.The struggling foe may now unclasp
    The fainting Chief's relaxing grasp;
    Unwounded from the dreadful close,
    But breathless all, Fitz-James arose.He falter'd thanks to Heaven for life,
    Redeem'd, unhoped, from desperate strife;
    Next on his foe his look he cast,
    Whose every gasp appear'd his last;
    In Roderick's gore he dipt the braid,--
    "Poor Blanche!thy wrongs are dearly paid:
    Yet with thy foe must die, or live,
    The praise that Faith and Valor give."With that he blew a bugle note,
    Undid the collar from his throat,
    Unbonneted, and by the wave
    Sate down his brow and hands to lave.Then faint afar are heard the feet
    Of rushing steeds in gallop fleet;
    The sounds increase, and now are seen
    Four mounted squires in Lincoln green;
    Two who bear lance, and two who lead,
    By loosen'd rein, a saddled steed;
    Each onward held his headlong course,
    And by Fitz-James rein'd up his horse,--
    With wonder view'd the bloody spot--
    "Exclaim not, gallants!question not.--
    You, Herbert and Luffness, alight,
    And bind the wounds of yonder knight;
    Let the gray palfrey bear his weight,
    We destined for a fairer freight,
    And bring him on to Stirling straight;
    I will before at better speed,
    To seek fresh horse and fitting weed.The sun rides high;--I must be boune,
    To see the archer game at noon;
    But lightly Bayard clears the lea.--
    De Vaux and Herries, follow me."--the steed obey'd,
    With arching neck and bended head,
    And glancing eye and quivering ear,
    As if he loved his lord to hear.No foot Fitz-James in stirrup stayed,
    No grasp upon the saddle laid,
    But wreath'd his left hand in the mane,
    And lightly bounded from the plain,
    Turn'd on the horse his armed heel,
    And stirr'd his courage with the steel.[293]
    Bounded the fiery steed in air,
    The rider sate erect and fair,
    Then like a bolt from steel crossbow
    Forth launch'd, along the plain they go.They dash'd that rapid torrent through,
    And up Carhonie's[294] hill they flew;
    Still at the gallop prick'd[295] the Knight,
    His merry-men follow'd as they might.they ride,
    And in the race they mock thy tide;
    Torry and Lendrick now are past,
    And Deanstown lies behind them cast;
    They rise, the banner'd towers of Doune,
    They sink in distant woodland soon;
    Blair-Drummond sees the hoofs strike fire,
    They sweep like breeze through Ochtertyre;
    They mark just glance and disappear
    The lofty brow of ancient Kier;
    They bathe their coursers' sweltering sides,
    Dark Forth!amid thy sluggish tides,
    And on the opposing shore take ground,
    With plash, with scramble, and with bound.Right-hand they leave thy cliffs, Craig-Forth!And soon the bulwark of the North,
    Gray Stirling, with her towers and town,
    Upon their fleet career look'd down.[294] About a mile from the mouth of Lake Vennachar.As up the flinty path they strain'd,
    Sudden his steed the leader rein'd;
    A signal to his squire he flung,
    Who instant to his stirrup sprung:--
    "Seest thou, De Vaux, yon woodsman gray,
    Who townward holds the rocky way,
    Of stature tall and poor array?Mark'st thou the firm, yet active stride,
    With which he scales the mountain side?Know'st thou from whence he comes, or whom?"--
    "No, by my word;--a burly groom
    He seems, who in the field or chase
    A baron's train would nobly grace."--
    "Out, out, De Vaux!can fear supply,
    And jealousy, no sharper eye?Afar, ere to the hill he drew,
    That stately form and step I knew;
    Like form in Scotland is not seen,
    Treads not such step on Scottish green.'Tis James of Douglas, by St.Away, away, to court, to show
    The near approach of dreaded foe:
    The King must stand upon his guard;
    Douglas and he must meet prepared."Then right-hand wheel'd their steeds, and straight
    They won the Castle's postern gate.The Douglas, who had bent his way
    From Cambus-kenneth's Abbey gray,
    Now, as he climb'd the rocky shelf,
    Held sad communion with himself:--
    "Yes!all is true my fears could frame;
    A prisoner lies the noble Graeme,
    And fiery Roderick soon will feel
    The vengeance of the royal steel.I, only I, can ward their fate,--
    God grant the ransom come not late!The Abbess hath her promise given,
    My child shall be the bride of Heaven;[296]--
    --Be pardon'd one repining tear!For He, who gave her, knows how dear,
    How excellent!but that is by,
    And now my business is--to die.within whose circuit dread
    A Douglas[297] by his sovereign bled;
    And thou, O sad and fatal mound![298]
    That oft hast heard the death-ax sound,
    As on the noblest of the land
    Fell the stern headsman's bloody hand,--
    The dungeon, block, and nameless tomb
    Prepare--for Douglas seeks his doom!--
    --But hark!what blithe and jolly peal
    Makes the Franciscan[299] steeple reel?upon the crowded street,
    In motley groups what maskers meet!Banner and pageant, pipe and drum,
    And merry morris dancers[300] come.I guess, by all this quaint array,
    The burghers hold their sports to-day.[301]
    James will be there; he loves such show,
    Where the good yeoman bends his bow,
    And the tough wrestler foils his foe,
    As well as where, in proud career,
    The high-born tilter shivers spear.I'll follow to the Castle-park,
    And play my prize;--King James shall mark,
    If age has tamed these sinews stark,[302]
    Whose force so oft, in happier days,
    His boyish wonder loved to praise."[296] "Bride of Heaven," i.e., a nun.[297] William, eighth earl of Douglas, was stabbed by James II.while
in Stirling Castle, and under royal safe-conduct.[298] "Heading Hill," where executions took place.[299] A church of the Franciscans or Gray Friars was built near the
castle, in 1494, by James IV.[300] The morris dance was of Moorish origin, and brought from Spain
to England, where it was combined with the national Mayday games.The
dress of the dancers was adorned with party- ribbons, and little
bells were attached to their anklets, armlets, or girdles.The dancers
often personated various fictitious characters.[301] Every borough had its solemn play or festival, where archery,
wrestling, hurling the bar, and other athletic exercises, were engaged
in.The Castle gates were open flung,
    The quivering drawbridge rock'd and rung,
    And echo'd loud the flinty street
    Beneath the coursers' clattering feet,
    As slowly down the steep descent
    Fair Scotland's King and nobles went,
    While all along the crowded way
    Was jubilee and loud huzza.And ever James was bending low,
    To his white jennet's[303] saddlebow,
    Doffing his cap to city dame,
    Who smiled and blush'd for pride and shame.And well the simperer might be vain,--
    He chose the fairest of the train.Gravely he greets each city sire,
    Commends each pageant's quaint attire,
    Gives to the dancers thanks aloud,
    And smiles and nods upon the crowd,
    Who rend the heavens with their acclaims,--
    "Long live the Commons' King,[304] King James!"Behind the King throng'd peer and knight,
    And noble dame, and damsel bright,
    Whose fiery steeds ill brook'd the stay
    Of the steep street and crowded way.--But in the train you might discern
    Dark lowering brow, and visage stern:
    There nobles mourn'd their pride restrain'd,
    And the mean burgher's joys disdain'd;
    And chiefs, who, hostage for their clan,
    Were each from home a banish'd man,
    There thought upon their own gray tower,
    Their waving woods, their feudal power,
    And deem'd themselves a shameful part
    Of pageant which they cursed in heart.in France, James V.
had checked the lawless nobles, and favored the commons or burghers.Now, in the Castle-park, drew out
    Their checker'd[305] bands the joyous rout.There morrisers, with bell at heel,
    And blade in hand, their mazes wheel;
    But chief, beside the butts, there stand
    Bold Robin Hood[306] and all his band,--
    Friar Tuck with quarterstaff and cowl,
    Old Scathlock with his surly scowl,
    Maid Marian, fair as ivory bone,
    Scarlet, and Mutch, and Little John;[307]
    Their bugles challenge all that will,
    In archery to prove their skill.The Douglas bent a bow of might,--
    His first shaft centered in the white,
    And when in turn he shot again,
    His second split the first in twain.From the King's hand must Douglas take
    A silver dart,[308] the archer's stake;
    Fondly he watch'd, with watery eye,
    Some answering glance of sympathy,--
    No kind emotion made reply!Indifferent as to archer wight,[309]
    The Monarch gave the arrow bright.[305] In clothing of varied form and color.[306] A renowned English outlaw and robber, supposed to have lived at
the end of the twelfth and beginning of the thirteenth century, and to
have frequented Sherwood Forest.Characters representing him and his
followers were often introduced into the popular games.[307] All six were followers of Robin Hood.[308] The usual prize to the best shooter was a silver arrow.[309] A simple, ordinary archer.for, hand to hand,
    The manly wrestlers take their stand.Two o'er the rest superior rose,
    And proud demanded mightier foes,
    Nor call'd in vain; for Douglas came.--For life is Hugh of Larbert lame;
    Scarce better John of Alloa's fare,
    Whom senseless home his comrades bear.Prize of the wrestling match, the King
    To Douglas gave a golden ring,
    While coldly glanced his eye of blue,
    As frozen drop of wintry dew.Douglas would speak, but in his breast
    His struggling soul his words suppress'd;
    Indignant then he turn'd him where
    Their arms the brawny yeoman bare,
    To hurl the massive bar in air.When each his utmost strength had shown,
    The Douglas rent an earth-fast stone
    From its deep bed, then heaved it high,
    And sent the fragment through the sky,
    A rood beyond the farthest mark;--
    And still in Stirling's royal park,
    The gray-haired sires, who know the past,
    To strangers point the Douglas-cast,[310]
    And moralize on the decay
    Of Scottish strength in modern day.The vale with loud applauses rang,
    The Ladies' Rock[311] sent back the clang.The King, with look unmoved, bestow'd
    A purse well fill'd with pieces broad.Indignant smiled the Douglas proud,
    And threw the gold among the crowd,
    Who now, with anxious wonder, scan,
    And sharper glance, the dark gray man;
    Till whispers rose among the throng,
    That heart so free, and hand so strong,
    Must to the Douglas blood belong;
    The old men mark'd, and shook the head,
    To see his hair with silver spread,
    And wink'd aside, and told each son
    Of feats upon the English done,
    Ere Douglas of the stalwart hand
    Was exiled from his native land.The women praised his stately form,
    Though wreck'd by many a winter's storm;
    The youth with awe and wonder saw
    His strength surpassing nature's law.Thus judged, as is their wont, the crowd,
    Till murmur rose to clamors loud.But not a glance from that proud ring
    Of peers who circled round the King,
    With Douglas held communion kind,
    Or call'd the banish'd man to mind;
    No, not from those who, at the chase,
    Once held his side the honor'd place,
    Begirt[312] his board, and, in the field,
    Found safety underneath his shield;
    For he, whom royal eyes disown,
    When was his form to courtiers known![311] A point from which the ladies of the court viewed the games.The Monarch saw the gambols flag,
    And bade let loose a gallant stag,
    Whose pride, the holiday to crown,
    Two favorite greyhounds should pull down,
    That venison free, and Bordeaux wine,
    Might serve the archery to dine.But Lufra,--whom from Douglas' side
    Nor bribe nor threat could e'er divide,
    The fleetest hound in all the North,--
    Brave Lufra saw, and darted forth.She left the royal hounds midway,
    And dashing on the antler'd prey,
    Sunk her sharp muzzle in his flank,
    And deep the flowing lifeblood drank.The King's stout huntsman saw the sport
    By strange intruder broken short,
    Came up, and with his leash unbound,
    In anger struck the noble hound.--The Douglas had endured, that morn,
    The King's cold look, the nobles' scorn,
    And last, and worst to spirit proud,
    Had borne the pity of the crowd;
    But Lufra had been fondly bred,
    To share his board, to watch his bed,
    And oft would Ellen, Lufra's neck
    In maiden glee with garlands deck;
    They were such playmates, that with name
    Of Lufra, Ellen's image came.His stifled wrath is brimming high,
    In darken'd brow and flashing eye;
    As waves before the bark divide,
    The crowd gave way before his stride;
    Needs but a buffet and no more,
    The groom lies senseless in his gore.Such blow no other hand could deal
    Though gauntleted in glove of steel.Then clamor'd loud the royal train,
    And brandish'd swords and staves amain.But stern the baron's warning--"Back!Back, on[313] your lives, ye menial pack!behold,
    King James!The Douglas, doom'd of old,
    And vainly sought for near and far,
    A victim to atone the war,
    A willing victim, now attends,
    Nor craves thy grace but for his friends."--
    "Thus is my clemency repaid?the Monarch said;
    "Of thy mis-proud[314] ambitious clan,
    Thou, James of Bothwell, wert the man,
    The only man, in whom a foe
    My woman mercy would not know:
    But shall a Monarch's presence brook
    Injurious blow, and haughty look?--
    What ho!Give the offender fitting ward.--
    Break off the sports!"--for tumult rose,
    And yeomen 'gan to bend their bows,--
    "Break off the sports!"he said, and frown'd,
    "And bid our horsemen clear the ground."Then uproar wild and misarray[315]
    Marr'd the fair form of festal day.The horsemen prick'd among the crowd,
    Repell'd by threats and insult loud;
    To earth are borne the old and weak,
    The timorous fly, the women shriek;
    With flint, with shaft, with staff, with bar,
    The hardier urge tumultuous war.At once round Douglas darkly sweep
    The royal spears in circle deep,
    And slowly scale the pathway steep;
    While on the rear in thunder pour
    The rabble with disorder'd roar.With grief the noble Douglas saw
    The Commons rise against the law,
    And to the leading soldier said,--
    "Sir John of Hyndford![316] 'twas my blade
    That knighthood on thy shoulder laid;[317]
    For that good deed, permit me then
    A word with these misguided men."[317] Knighthood was conferred by a slight blow with the flat of a
sword on the back of the kneeling candidate.ere yet for me
    Ye break the bands of fealty.My life, my honor, and my cause,
    I tender free to Scotland's laws.Are these so weak as must require
    The aid of your misguided ire?Or, if I suffer causeless wrong,
    Is then my selfish rage so strong,
    My sense of public weal so low,
    That, for mean vengeance on a foe,
    Those cords of love I should unbind,
    Which knit my country and my kind?Believe, in yonder tower
    It will not soothe my captive hour,
    To know those spears our foes should dread,
    For me in kindred gore are red;
    To know, in fruitless brawl begun
    For me, that mother wails her son;
    For me, that widow's mate expires;
    For me, that orphans weep their sires;
    That patriots mourn insulted laws,
    And curse the Douglas for the cause.Oh, let your patience ward[318] such ill,
    And keep your right to love me still!"The crowd's wild fury sunk again
    In tears, as tempests melt in rain.With lifted hands and eyes, they pray'd
    For blessings on his generous head,
    Who for his country felt alone,
    And prized her blood beyond his own.Old men, upon the verge of life,
    Bless'd him who stayed the civil strife;
    And mothers held their babes on high,
    The self-devoted Chief to spy,
    Triumphant over wrongs and ire,
    To whom the prattlers owed a sire:
    Even the rough soldier's heart was moved;
    As if behind some bier beloved,
    With trailing arms and drooping head,
    The Douglas up the hill he led,
    And at the Castle's battled verge,
    With sighs resign'd his honor'd charge.The offended Monarch rode apart,
    With bitter thought and swelling heart,
    And would not now vouchsafe again
    Through Stirling streets to lead his train.--
    "O Lennox, who would wish to rule
    This changeling[319] crowd, this common fool?Hear'st thou," he said, "the loud acclaim
    With which they shout the Douglas name?With like acclaim, the vulgar throat
    Strain'd for King James their morning note;
    With like acclaim they hail'd the day
    When first I broke the Douglas' sway;
    And like acclaim would Douglas greet,
    If he could hurl me from my seat.Who o'er the herd would wish to reign,
    Fantastic, fickle, fierce, and vain!Vain as the leaf upon the stream,
    And fickle as a changeful dream;
    Fantastic as a woman's mood,
    And fierce as Frenzy's fever'd blood,
    Thou many-headed monster thing,
    Oh, who would wish to be thy king!"what messenger of speed
    Spurs hitherward his panting steed?I guess his cognizance[320] afar--
    What from our cousin,[321] John of Mar?"--
    "He prays, my liege, your sports keep bound
    Within the safe and guarded ground:
    For some foul purpose yet unknown,--
    Most sure for evil to the throne,--
    The outlaw'd Chieftain, Roderick Dhu,
    Has summon'd his rebellious crew;
    'Tis said, in James of Bothwell's aid
    These loose banditti stand array'd.The Earl of Mar, this morn, from Doune,
    To break their muster march'd, and soon
    Your grace will hear of battle fought;
    But earnestly the Earl besought,
    Till for such danger he provide,
    With scanty train you will not ride."[321] Monarchs frequently applied this epithet to their noblemen, even
when no blood relationship existed."Thou warn'st me I have done amiss,--
    I should have earlier look'd to this:
    I lost it in this bustling day.--Retrace with speed thy former way;
    Spare not for spoiling of thy steed,
    The best of mine shall be thy meed.Say to our faithful Lord of Mar,
    We do forbid the intended war:
    Roderick, this morn, in single fight,
    Was made our prisoner by a knight;
    And Douglas hath himself and cause
    Submitted to our kingdom's laws.The tidings of their leaders lost
    Will soon dissolve the mountain host,
    Nor would we that the vulgar feel,
    For their Chief's crimes, avenging steel.Bear Mar our message, Braco: fly!"--
    He turn'd his steed,--"My liege, I hie,--
    Yet, ere I cross this lily lawn,
    I fear the broadswords will be drawn."The turf the flying courser spurn'd,
    And to his towers the King return'd.Ill with King James's mood that day,
    Suited gay feast and minstrel lay;
    Soon were dismiss'd the courtly throng,
    And soon cut short the festal song.Nor less upon the sadden'd town
    The evening sunk in sorrow down.The burghers spoke of civil jar,
    Of rumor'd feuds and mountain war,
    Of Moray, Mar, and Roderick Dhu,
    All up in arms:--the Douglas too,
    They mourn'd him pent within the hold,
    "Where stout Earl William[322] was of old."--
    And there his word the speaker stayed,
    And finger on his lip he laid,
    Or pointed to his dagger blade.But jaded horsemen, from the west,
    At evening to the Castle press'd;
    And busy talkers said they bore
    Tidings of fight on Katrine's shore;
    At noon the deadly fray begun,
    And lasted till the set of sun.Thus giddy rumor shook the town,
    Till closed the Night her pennons brown.[322] The Douglas who was stabbed by James II.I.

    The sun, awakening, through the smoky air
      Of the dark city casts a sullen glance,
    Rousing each caitiff[323] to his task of care,
      Of sinful man the sad inheritance;
    Summoning revelers from the lagging dance,
      Scaring the prowling robber to his den;
    Gilding on battled tower the warder's lance,
      And warning student pale to leave his pen,
    And yield his drowsy eyes to the kind nurse of men.what scenes of woe,
      Are witness'd by that red and struggling beam!The fever'd patient, from his pallet low,
      Through crowded hospital beholds its stream;
    The ruin'd maiden trembles at its gleam,
      The debtor wakes to thought of gyve and jail,
    The lovelorn wretch starts from tormenting dream;
      The wakeful mother, by the glimmering pale,
    Trims her sick infant's couch, and soothes his feeble wail.At dawn the towers of Stirling rang
    With soldier step and weapon clang,
    While drums, with rolling note, foretell
    Relief to weary sentinel.Through narrow loop and casement barr'd,
    The sunbeams sought the Court of Guard,
    And, struggling with the smoky air,
    Deaden'd the torches' yellow glare.In comfortless alliance shone
    The lights through arch of blacken'd stone,
    And show'd wild shapes in garb of war,
    Faces deform'd with beard and scar,
    All haggard from the midnight watch,
    And fever'd with the stern debauch;
    For the oak table's massive board,
    Flooded with wine, with fragments stored,
    And beakers drain'd, and cups o'erthrown,
    Show'd in what sport the night had flown.Some, weary, snored on floor and bench;
    Some labor'd still their thirst to quench;
    Some, chill'd with watching, spread their hands
    O'er the huge chimney's dying brands,
    While round them, or beside them flung,
    At every step their harness[324] rung.[324] Armor and other accouterments of war.These drew not for their fields the sword,
    Like tenants of a feudal lord,
    Nor own'd the patriarchal claim
    Of Chieftain in their leader's name;
    Adventurers[325] they, from far who roved,
    To live by battle which they loved.There the Italian's clouded face,
    The swarthy Spaniard's there you trace;
    The mountain-loving Switzer[326] there
    More freely breathed in mountain air;
    The Fleming[327] there despised the soil,
    That paid so ill the laborer's toil;
    Their rolls show'd French and German name;
    And merry England's exiles came,
    To share, with ill-conceal'd disdain,
    Of Scotland's pay the scanty gain.All brave in arms, well train'd to wield
    The heavy halberd, brand, and shield;
    In camps licentious, wild, and bold;
    In pillage fierce and uncontroll'd;
    And now, by holytide[328] and feast,
    From rules of discipline released.[325] James V. was the first to increase the army furnished by
the nobles and their vassals by the addition of a small number of
mercenaries.[327] An inhabitant of Flanders, as Belgium was then called.They held debate of bloody fray,
    Fought 'twixt Loch Katrine and Achray.Fierce was their speech, and,'mid their words,
    Their hands oft grappled to their swords;
    Nor sunk their tone to spare the ear
    Of wounded comrades groaning near,
    Whose mangled limbs, and bodies gored,
    Bore token of the mountain sword,
    Though, neighboring to the Court of Guard,
    Their prayers and feverish wails were heard;
    Sad burden to the ruffian joke,
    And savage oath by fury spoke!--
    At length up started John of Brent,
    A yeoman from the banks of Trent;
    A stranger to respect or fear,
    In peace a chaser[329] of the deer,
    In host[330] a hardy mutineer,
    But still the boldest of the crew,
    When deed of danger was to do.He grieved, that day, their games cut short,
    And marr'd the dicer's brawling sport,
    And shouted loud, "Renew the bowl!And, while a merry catch I troll,
    Let each the buxom chorus bear,
    Like brethren of the brand and spear."V.

SOLDIER'S SONG.Our vicar still preaches that Peter and Poule[331]
    Laid a swinging[332] long curse on the bonny brown bowl,
    That there's wrath and despair in the jolly black-jack,[333]
    And the seven deadly sins in a flagon of sack;[334]
    Yet whoop, Barnaby!off with thy liquor,
    Drink upsees out,[335] and a fig for the vicar!Our vicar he calls it damnation to sip
    The ripe ruddy dew of a woman's dear lip,
    Says, that Beelzebub[336] lurks in her kerchief so sly,
    And Apollyon[337] shoots darts from her merry black eye;
    Yet whoop, Jack!kiss Gillian the quicker,
    Till she bloom like a rose, and a fig for the vicar!Our vicar thus preaches--and why should he not?For the dues of his cure are the placket and pot;[338]
    And 'tis right of his office poor laymen to lurch,
    Who infringe the domains of our good Mother Church.off with your liquor,
    Sweet Marjorie's the word, and a fig for the vicar![335] "Upsees out," i.e., in the Dutch fashion, or deeply.[338] "Placket and pot," i.e., women and wine.The warder's challenge, heard without,
    Stayed in mid-roar the merry shout.A soldier to the portal went,--
    "Here is old Bertram, sirs, of Ghent;
    And,--beat for jubilee the drum!--
    A maid and minstrel with him come."Bertram, a Fleming, gray and scarr'd,
    Was entering now the Court of Guard,
    A harper with him, and in plaid
    All muffled close, a mountain maid,
    Who backward shrunk to'scape the view
    Of the loose scene and boisterous crew.they roar'd.--"I only know,
    From noon till eve we fought with foe
    As wild and as untamable
    As the rude mountains where they dwell;
    On both sides store of blood is lost,
    Nor much success can either boast."--
    "But whence thy captives, friend?such spoil
    As theirs must needs reward thy toil.Old dost thou wax, and wars grow sharp;
    Thou now hast glee-maiden and harp!Get thee an ape, and trudge the land,
    The leader of a juggler band.""No, comrade;--no such fortune mine.After the fight, these sought our line,
    That aged Harper and the girl,
    And, having audience of the Earl,
    Mar bade I should purvey them steed,
    And bring them hitherward with speed.Forbear your mirth and rude alarm,
    For none shall do them shame or harm."--
    "Hear ye his boast?"cried John of Brent,
    Ever to strife and jangling bent;
    "Shall he strike doe beside our lodge,
    And yet the jealous niggard grudge
    To pay the forester his fee?I'll have my share, howe'er it be,
    Despite of Moray, Mar, or thee."Bertram his forward step withstood;
    And, burning in his vengeful mood,
    Old Allan, though unfit for strife,
    Laid hand upon his dagger knife;
    But Ellen boldly stepp'd between,
    And dropp'd at once the tartan screen:--
    So, from his morning cloud, appears
    The sun of May, through summer tears.The savage soldiery, amazed,
    As on descended angel gazed;
    Even hardy Brent, abash'd and tamed,
    Stood half admiring, half ashamed.Boldly she spoke,--"Soldiers, attend!My father was the soldier's friend;
    Cheer'd him in camps, in marches led,
    And with him in the battle bled.Not from the valiant, or the strong,
    Should exile's daughter suffer wrong."--
    Answer'd De Brent, most forward still
    In every feat or good or ill,--
    "I shame me of the part I play'd;
    And thou an outlaw's child, poor maid!An outlaw I by forest laws,
    And merry Needwood[339] knows the cause.Poor Rose,--if Rose be living now,"--
    He wiped his iron eye and brow,--
    "Must bear such age, I think, as thou.--
    Hear ye, my mates;--I go to call
    The Captain of our watch to hall:
    There lies my halberd on the floor;
    And he that steps my halberd o'er,
    To do the maid injurious part,
    My shaft shall quiver in his heart!--
    Beware loose speech, or jesting rough:
    Ye all know John de Brent.[339] A royal forest in Staffordshire.Their Captain came, a gallant young,--
    Of Tullibardine's[340] house he sprung,--
    Nor wore he yet the spurs of knight;
    Gay was his mien, his humor light,
    And, though by courtesy controll'd,
    Forward his speech, his bearing bold.The high-born maiden ill could brook
    The scanning of his curious look
    And dauntless eye;--and yet, in sooth,
    Young Lewis was a generous youth;
    But Ellen's lovely face and mien,
    Ill suited to the garb and scene,
    Might lightly bear construction strange,
    And give loose fancy scope to range."Welcome to Stirling towers, fair maid!Come ye to seek a champion's aid,
    On palfrey white, with harper hoar,
    Like errant damosel[341] of yore?Does thy high quest[342] a knight require,
    Or may the venture suit a squire?"--
    Her dark eye flash'd;--she paused and sigh'd,--
    "Oh, what have I to do with pride!--
    Through scenes of sorrow, shame, and strife,
    A suppliant for a father's life,
    I crave an audience of the King.Behold, to back my suit, a ring,
    The royal pledge of grateful claims,
    Given by the Monarch to Fitz-James."[340] Tullibardine was an old seat of the Murrays in Perthshire.[341] In the days of chivalry any oppressed "damosel" could obtain
redress by applying to the court of the nearest king, where some knight
became her champion.X.

    The signet ring young Lewis took,
    With deep respect and alter'd look;
    And said,--"This ring our duties own;
    And pardon, if to worth unknown,
    In semblance mean, obscurely veil'd,
    Lady, in aught my folly fail'd.Soon as the day flings wide his gates,
    The King shall know what suitor waits.Please you, meanwhile, in fitting bower
    Repose you till his waking hour;
    Female attendance shall obey
    Your hest, for service or array.But, ere she followed, with the grace
    And open bounty of her race,
    She bade her slender purse be shared
    Among the soldiers of the guard.The rest with thanks their guerdon took;
    But Brent, with shy and awkward look,
    On the reluctant maiden's hold
    Forced bluntly back the proffer'd gold;--
    "Forgive a haughty English heart,
    And oh, forget its ruder part!The vacant purse shall be my share,
    Which in my barret cap I'll bear,
    Perchance, in jeopardy of war,
    Where gayer crests may keep afar."With thanks--'twas all she could--the maid
    His rugged courtesy repaid.When Ellen forth with Lewis went,
    Allan made suit to John of Brent:--
    "My lady safe, oh, let your grace
    Give me to see my master's face!His minstrel I,--to share his doom
    Bound from the cradle to the tomb.Tenth in descent, since first my sires
    Waked for his noble house their lyres,
    Nor one of all the race was known
    But prized its weal above their own.With the Chief's birth begins our care;
    Our harp must soothe the infant heir,
    Teach the youth tales of fight, and grace
    His earliest feat of field or chase;
    In peace, in war, our rank we keep,
    We cheer his board, we soothe his sleep,
    Nor leave him till we pour our verse--
    A doleful tribute!--o'er his hearse.Then let me share his captive lot;
    It is my right--deny it not!"--
    "Little we reck," said John of Brent,
    "We Southern men, of long descent;
    Nor wot we how a name--a word--
    Makes clansmen vassals to a lord:
    Yet kind my noble landlord's part,--
    God bless the house of Beaudesert!And, but I loved to drive the deer,
    More than to guide the laboring steer,
    I had not dwelt an outcast here.Come, good old Minstrel, follow me;
    Thy Lord and Chieftain shalt thou see."Then, from a rusted iron hook,
    A bunch of ponderous keys he took,
    Lighted a torch, and Allan led
    Through grated arch and passage dread.Portals they pass'd, where, deep within,
    Spoke prisoner's moan, and fetters' din;
    Through rugged vaults, where, loosely stored,
    Lay wheel, and ax, and headsman's sword,
    And many an hideous engine grim,
    For wrenching joint, and crushing limb,
    By artist form'd, who deemed it shame
    And sin to give their work a name.They halted at a low-brow'd porch,
    And Brent to Allan gave the torch,
    While bolt and chain he backward roll'd,
    And made the bar unhasp its hold.They enter'd:--'twas a prison room
    Of stern security and gloom,
    Yet not a dungeon; for the day
    Through lofty gratings found its way,
    And rude and antique garniture
    Deck'd the sad walls and oaken floor;
    Such as the rugged days of old
    Deem'd fit for captive noble's hold.[343]
    "Here," said De Brent, "thou mayst remain
    Till the Leech[344] visit him again.Strict is his charge, the warders tell,
    To tend the noble prisoner well."Retiring then, the bolt he drew,
    And the lock's murmurs growl'd anew.Roused at the sound, from lowly bed
    A captive feebly raised his head;
    The wondering Minstrel look'd, and knew--
    Not his dear lord, but Roderick Dhu!For, come from where Clan-Alpine fought,
    They, erring, deem'd the Chief he sought.As the tall ship, whose lofty prore[345]
    Shall never stem the billows more,
    Deserted by her gallant band,
    Amid the breakers lies astrand,[346]
    So, on his couch, lay Roderick Dhu!And oft his fever'd limbs he threw
    In toss abrupt, as when her sides
    Lie rocking in the advancing tides,
    That shake her frame with ceaseless beat,
    Yet cannot heave her from the seat;--
    Oh, how unlike her course on sea!Or his free step on hill and lea!--
    Soon as the Minstrel he could scan,
    "What of thy lady?--of my clan?--
    My mother?--Douglas?--tell me all.Yet speak,--speak boldly,--do not fear."--
    (For Allan, who his mood well knew,
    Was choked with grief and terror too.)"Who fought--who fled?--Old man, be brief;--
    Some might--for they had lost their Chief.Who basely live?--who bravely died?"--
    "Oh, calm thee, Chief!"the Minstrel cried;
    "Ellen is safe;"--"For that, thank Heaven!"--
    "And hopes are for the Douglas given;--
    The lady Margaret, too, is well;
    And, for thy clan,--on field or fell,
    Has never harp of minstrel told
    Of combat fought so true and bold.Thy stately Pine is yet unbent,
    Though many a goodly bough is rent."The Chieftain rear'd his form on high,
    And fever's fire was in his eye;
    But ghastly, pale, and livid streaks
    Checker'd his swarthy brow and cheeks.I have heard thee play,
    With measure bold, on festal day,
    In yon lone isle,... again where ne'er
    Shall harper play, or warrior hear!That stirring air that peals on high,
    O'er Dermid's[347] race our victory.--
    Strike it!--and then, (for well thou canst,)
    Free from thy minstrel spirit glanced,
    Fling me the picture of the fight,
    When met my clan the Saxon might.I'll listen, till my fancy hears
    The clang of swords, the crash of spears!These grates, these walls, shall vanish then,
    For the fair field of fighting men,
    And my free spirit burst away,
    As if it soar'd from battle fray."The trembling Bard with awe obey'd,--
    Slow on the harp his hand he laid;
    But soon remembrance of the sight
    He witness'd from the mountain's height,
    With what old Bertram told at night,
    Awaken'd the full power of song,
    And bore him in career along;--
    As shallop launch'd on river's tide,
    That slow and fearful leaves the side,
    But, when it feels the middle stream,
    Drives downward swift as lightning's beam.The Clan-Alpine, or the MacGregors, and the
Campbells, were hereditary enemies.BATTLE OF BEAL' AN DUINE."The Minstrel came once more to view
    The eastern ridge of Benvenue,
    For ere he parted, he would say
    Farewell to lovely Loch Achray--
    Where shall he find, in foreign land,
    So lone a lake, so sweet a strand!There is no breeze upon the fern,
        Nor ripple on the lake,
      Upon her eyry nods the erne,[348]
        The deer has sought the brake;
      The small birds will not sing aloud,
        The springing trout lies still,
      So darkly glooms yon thunder cloud,
      That swathes, as with a purple shroud,
        Benledi's distant hill.Is it the thunder's solemn sound
        That mutters deep and dread,
      Or echoes from the groaning ground
        The warrior's measured tread?Is it the lightning's quivering glance
        That on the thicket streams,
      Or do they flash on spear and lance
        The sun's retiring beams?I see the dagger crest of Mar,
    I see the Moray's silver star,
    Wave o'er the cloud of Saxon war,
    That up the lake comes winding far!To hero bound for battle strife,
        Or bard of martial lay,
      'Twere worth ten years of peaceful life,
        One glance at their array!"[348] The sea eagle or osprey."Their light arm'd archers far and near
        Survey'd the tangled ground;
      Their center ranks, with pike and spear,
        A twilight forest frown'd;
      Their barbed[349] horsemen, in the rear,
        The stern battalia[350] crown'd.No cymbal clash'd, no clarion rang,
        Still were the pipe and drum;
      Save heavy tread, and armor's clang,
        The sullen march was dumb.There breathed no wind their crests to shake,
        Or wave their flags abroad;
      Scarce the frail aspen seem'd to quake,
        That shadow'd o'er their road.Their vaward[351] scouts no tidings bring,
        Can rouse no lurking foe,
      Nor spy a trace of living thing,
        Save when they stirr'd the roe;
      The host moves like a deep-sea wave,
      Where rise no rocks its pride to brave,
        High swelling, dark, and slow.The lake is pass'd, and now they gain
    A narrow and a broken plain,
    Before the Trosachs' rugged jaws;
    And here the horse and spearmen pause.While, to explore the dangerous glen,
    Dive through the pass the archer men.""At once there rose so wild a yell
    Within that dark and narrow dell,
    As all the fiends, from heaven that fell,
    Had peal'd the banner cry of hell!Forth from the pass in tumult driven,
      Like chaff before the wind of heaven,
        The archery appear;
      For life!their plight they ply--
      And shriek, and shout, and battle cry,
      And plaids and bonnets waving high,
      And broadswords flashing to the sky,
        Are maddening in the rear.Onward they drive, in dreadful race,
        Pursuers and pursued;
      Before that tide of flight and chase,
      How shall it keep its rooted place,
        The spearmen's twilight wood?--
      'Down, down,' cried Mar, 'your lances down!--
      Like reeds before the tempest's frown,
      That serried grove of lances brown
        At once lay level'd low;
      And closely shouldering side to side,
      The bristling ranks the onset bide.--
      'We'll quell the savage mountaineer,
        As their Tinchel[352] cows the game!They come as fleet as forest deer,
        We'll drive them back as tame.'"--

[352] A circle of sportsmen surrounding a large space, which was
gradually narrowed till the game it inclosed was brought within reach."Bearing before them, in their course,
    The relics of the archer force,
    Like wave with crest of sparkling foam,
    Right onward did Clan-Alpine come.Above the tide, each broadsword bright
      Was brandishing like beam of light,
        Each targe was dark below;
      And with the ocean's mighty swing,
      When heaving to the tempest's wing,
        They hurl'd them on the foe.I heard the lance's shivering crash,
    As when the whirlwind rends the ash;
    I heard the broadsword's deadly clang,
    As if an hundred anvils rang!But Moray wheel'd his rearward rank
    Of horsemen on Clan-Alpine's flank,
        --'My banner man, advance!I see,' he cried, 'their column shake.--
      Now, gallants!for your ladies' sake,
        Upon them with the lance!'--
      The horsemen dash'd among the rout,
        As deer break through the broom;
      Their steeds are stout, their swords are out,
        They soon make lightsome room.Clan-Alpine's best are backward borne--
        Where, where was Roderick then?One blast upon his bugle horn
        Were worth a thousand men.And refluent[353] through the pass of fear
        The battle's tide was pour'd;
      Vanish'd the Saxon's struggling spear,
        Vanish'd the mountain sword.As Bracklinn's chasm, so black and steep,
        Receives her roaring linn,
      As the dark caverns of the deep
        Suck the dark whirlpool in,
    So did the deep and darksome pass
    Devour the battle's mingled mass:
    None linger now upon the plain,
    Save those who ne'er shall fight again.""Now westward rolls the battle's din,
    That deep and doubling pass within.the work of fate
    Is bearing on: its issue wait,
    Where the rude Trosachs' dread defile
    Opens on Katrine's lake and isle.Gray Benvenue I soon repass'd,
    Loch Katrine lay beneath me cast.The sun is set;--the clouds are met,
          The lowering scowl of heaven
      An inky hue of livid blue
          To the deep lake has given;
    Strange gusts of wind from mountain glen
    Swept o'er the lake, then sunk agen.I heeded not the eddying surge,
    Mine eye but saw the Trosachs' gorge,
    Mine ear but heard that sullen sound,
    Which like an earthquake shook the ground,
    And spoke the stern and desperate strife
    That parts not but with parting life,
    Seeming, to minstrel ear, to toll
    The dirge of many a passing soul.Nearer it comes--the dim-wood glen
      The martial flood disgorged agen,
          But not in mingled tide;
      The plaided warriors of the North
      High on the mountain thunder forth
          And overhang its side;
      While by the lake below appears
      The dark'ning cloud of Saxon spears.At weary bay each shatter'd band,
      Eying their foemen, sternly stand;
      Their banners stream like tatter'd sail,
      That flings its fragments to the gale,
      And broken arms and disarray
      Mark'd the fell havoc of the day.""Viewing the mountain's ridge askance,
    The Saxon stood in sullen trance,
    Till Moray pointed with his lance,
        And cried--'Behold yon isle!--
    See!none are left to guard its strand,
    But women weak, that wring the hand:
    'Tis there of yore the robber band
        Their booty wont to pile;--
    My purse, with bonnet pieces[354] store,
    To him will swim a bowshot o'er,
    And loose a shallop from the shore.Lightly we'll tame the war wolf then,
    Lords of his mate, and brood, and den.'--
    Forth from the ranks a spearman sprung,
    On earth his casque and corselet rung,
        He plunged him in the wave:--
    All saw the deed--the purpose knew,
    And to their clamors Benvenue
        A mingled echo gave;
    The Saxons shout, their mate to cheer,
    The helpless females scream for fear,
    And yells for rage the mountaineer.'Twas then, as by the outcry riven,
    Pour'd down at once the lowering heaven;
    A whirlwind swept Loch Katrine's breast,
    Her billows rear'd their snowy crest.Well for the swimmer swell'd they high,
    To mar the Highland marksman's eye;
    For round him shower'd,'mid rain and hail,
    The vengeful arrows of the Gael.--
    In vain--He nears the isle--and lo!His hand is on a shallop's bow.--Just then a flash of lightning came,
    It tinged the waves and strand with flame;--
    I mark'd Duncraggan's widow'd dame--
    Behind an oak I saw her stand,
    A naked dirk gleam'd in her hand:
    It darken'd,--but, amid the moan
    Of waves, I heard a dying groan;
    Another flash!--the spearman floats
    A weltering corse beside the boats,
    And the stern matron o'er him stood,
    Her hand and dagger streaming blood."[354] A bonnet piece is an elegant gold coin, bearing on one side the
head of James V. wearing a bonnet.the Saxons cried--
    The Gael's exulting shout replied.Despite the elemental rage,
    Again they hurried to engage;
    But, ere they closed in desperate fight,
    Bloody with spurring came a knight,
    Sprung from his horse, and, from a crag,
    Waved 'twixt the hosts a milk-white flag.Clarion and trumpet by his side
    Rung forth a truce note high and wide,
    While, in the Monarch's name, afar
    An herald's voice forbade the war,
    For Bothwell's lord, and Roderick bold,
    Were both, he said, in captive hold."--But here the lay made sudden stand,
    The harp escaped the Minstrel's hand!--
    Oft had he stolen a glance, to spy
    How Roderick brook'd his minstrelsy:
    At first, the Chieftain, to the chime,
    With lifted hand, kept feeble time;
    That motion ceased,--yet feeling strong
    Varied his look as changed the song;
    At length, no more his deafen'd ear
    The minstrel melody can hear;
    His face grows sharp,--his hands are clench'd,
    As if some pang his heartstrings wrench'd;
    Set are his teeth, his fading eye
    Is sternly fix'd on vacancy;
    Thus, motionless, and moanless, drew
    His parting breath, stout Roderick Dhu!--
    Old Allan-Bane look'd on aghast,
    While grim and still his spirit pass'd:
    But when he saw that life was fled,
    He pour'd his wailing o'er the dead."And art them cold and lowly laid,
    Thy foeman's dread, thy people's aid,
    Breadalbane's[355] boast, Clan-Alpine's shade!For thee shall none a requiem say?--
    For thee,--who loved the Minstrel's lay,
    For thee, of Bothwell's house the stay,
    The shelter of her exiled line?E'en in this prison house of thine,
    I'll wail for Alpine's honor'd Pine!"What groans shall yonder valleys fill!What shrieks of grief shall rend yon hill!What tears of burning rage shall thrill,
    When mourns thy tribe thy battles done,
    Thy fall before the race was won,
    Thy sword ungirt ere set of sun!There breathes not clansman of thy line,
    But would have given his life for thine.--
    Oh, woe for Alpine's honor'd Pine!"Sad was thy lot on mortal stage!--
    The captive thrush may brook the cage,
    The prison'd eagle dies for rage.And, when its notes awake again,
    Even she, so long beloved in vain,
    Shall with my harp her voice combine,
    And mix her woe and tears with mine,
    To wail Clan-Alpine's honor'd Pine."--

[355] The region bordering Loch Tay.Ellen, the while, with bursting heart,
    Remain'd in lordly bower apart,
    Where play'd, with many- gleams,
    Through storied[356] pane the rising beams.In vain on gilded roof they fall,
    And lighten'd up a tapestried wall,
    And for her use a menial train
    A rich collation spread in vain.The banquet proud, the chamber gay,
    Scarce drew one curious glance astray;
    Or if she look'd, 'twas but to say,
    With better omen dawn'd the day
    In that lone isle, where waved on high
    The dun deer's hide for canopy;
    Where oft her noble father shared
    The simple meal her care prepared,
    While Lufra, crouching by her side,
    Her station claim'd with jealous pride,
    And Douglas, bent on woodland game,
    Spoke of the chase to Malcolm Graeme,
    Whose answer, oft at random made,
    The wandering of his thoughts betray'd.--
    Those who such simple joys have known,
    Are taught to prize them when they're gone.But sudden, see, she lifts her head!What distant music has the power
    To win her in this woeful hour!'Twas from a turret that o'erhung
    Her latticed bower, the strain was sung.[356] Stained or painted to form pictures illustrating history.LAY OF THE IMPRISONED HUNTSMAN."My hawk is tired of perch and hood,
    My idle greyhound loathes his food,
    My horse is weary of his stall,
    And I am sick of captive thrall.I wish I were, as I have been,
    Hunting the hart in forest green,
    With bended bow and bloodhound free,
    For that's the life is meet for me."I hate to learn the ebb of time,
    From yon dull steeple's drowsy chime,
    Or mark it as the sunbeams crawl,
    Inch after inch, along the wall.The lark was wont my matins ring,
    The sable rook my vespers sing;
    These towers, although a king's they be,
    Have not a hall of joy for me."No more at dawning morn I rise,
    And sun myself in Ellen's eyes,
    Drive the fleet deer the forest through,
    And homeward wend with evening dew;
    A blithesome welcome blithely meet,
    And lay my trophies at her feet,
    While fled the eve on wing of glee,--
    That life is lost to love and me!"The heart-sick lay was hardly said,
    The list'ner had not turn'd her head,
    It trickled still, the starting tear,
    When light a footstep struck her ear,
    And Snowdoun's graceful Knight was near.She turn'd the hastier, lest again
    The prisoner should renew his strain."Oh, welcome, brave Fitz-James!"she said;
    "How may an almost orphan maid
    Pay the deep debt"--"Oh, say not so!the boon to give,
    And bid thy noble father live;
    I can but be thy guide, sweet maid,
    With Scotland's King thy suit to aid.No tyrant he, though ire and pride
    May lay his better mood aside.'tis more than time--
    He holds his court at morning prime."With beating heart, and bosom wrung,
    As to a brother's arm she clung.Gently he dried the falling tear,
    And gently whisper'd hope and cheer;
    Her faltering steps half led, half stayed,[357]
    Through gallery fair and high arcade,
    Till, at his touch, its wings of pride
    A portal arch unfolded wide.Within 'twas brilliant all and light,
    A thronging scene of figures bright;
    It glow'd on Ellen's dazzled sight,
    As when the setting sun has given
    Ten thousand hues to summer even,
    And from their tissue, fancy frames
    Aerial[358] knights and fairy dames.Still by Fitz-James her footing staid;
    A few faint steps she forward made,
    Then slow her drooping head she raised,
    And fearful round the presence[359] gazed;
    For him she sought, who own'd this state,
    The dreaded Prince, whose will was fate!--
    She gazed on many a princely port,
    Might well have ruled a royal court;
    On many a splendid garb she gazed,
    Then turn'd bewilder'd and amazed,
    For all stood bare; and, in the room,
    Fitz-James alone wore cap and plume.To him each lady's look was lent;
    On him each courtier's eye was bent;
    Midst furs, and silks, and jewels sheen,
    He stood, in simple Lincoln green,
    The center of the glittering ring,--
    And Snowdoun's Knight[360] is Scotland's King.[360] James V. was accustomed to make personal investigation of the
condition of his people.The name he generally assumed when in disguise
was "Laird of Ballingeich."As wreath of snow, on mountain breast,
    Slides from the rock that gave it rest,
    Poor Ellen glided from her stay,
    And at the Monarch's feet she lay;
    No word her choking voice commands,--
    She show'd the ring--she clasp'd her hands.not a moment could he brook,
    The generous Prince, that suppliant look!Gently he raised her; and, the while,
    Check'd with a glance the circle's smile;
    Graceful, but grave, her brow he kiss'd,
    And bade her terrors be dismiss'd:--
    "Yes, Fair; the wandering poor Fitz-James
    The fealty of Scotland claims.To him thy woes, thy wishes, bring;
    He will redeem his signet ring.Ask naught for Douglas; yestereven,
    His Prince and he have much forgiven:
    Wrong hath he had from slanderous tongue--
    I, from his rebel kinsmen, wrong.We would not, to the vulgar crowd,
    Yield what they craved with clamor loud;
    Calmly we heard and judged his cause,
    Our council aided, and our laws.I stanch'd thy father's death-feud stern
    With stout De Vaux and gray Glencairn;
    And Bothwell's Lord henceforth we own
    The friend and bulwark of our Throne.--
    But, lovely infidel, how now?Lord James of Douglas, lend thine aid;
    Thou must confirm this doubting maid."Then forth the noble Douglas sprung,
    And on his neck his daughter hung.The Monarch drank, that happy hour,
    The sweetest, holiest draught of Power,--
    When it can say, with godlike voice,
    Arise, sad Virtue, and rejoice!Yet would not James the general eye
    On Nature's raptures long should pry;
    He stepp'd between--"Nay, Douglas, nay,
    Steal not my proselyte away!The riddle 'tis my right to read,
    That brought this happy chance to speed.[361]
    Yes, Ellen, when disguised I stray
    In life's more low but happier way,
    'Tis under name which veils my power;
    Nor falsely veils--for Stirling's tower
    Of yore the name of Snowdoun claims,
    And Normans call me James Fitz-James.Thus watch I o'er insulted laws,
    Thus learn to right the injured cause."--
    Then, in a tone apart and low,--
    "Ah, little traitress!none must know
    What idle dream, what lighter thought,
    What vanity full dearly bought,
    Join'd to thine eye's dark witchcraft, drew
    My spellbound steps to Benvenue,
    In dangerous hour, and all but gave
    Thy Monarch's life to mountain glaive!"--
    Aloud he spoke,--"Thou still dost hold
    That little talisman of gold,
    Pledge of my faith, Fitz-James's ring--
    What seeks fair Ellen of the King?"Full well the conscious maiden guess'd
    He probed the weakness of her breast;
    But, with that consciousness, there came
    A lightening of her fears for Graeme,
    And more she deem'd the Monarch's ire
    Kindled 'gainst him, who, for her sire,
    Rebellious broadsword boldly drew;
    And, to her generous feeling true,
    She craved the grace of Roderick Dhu."Forbear thy suit:--the King of kings
    Alone can stay life's parting wings.I know his heart, I know his hand,
    Have shared his cheer, and proved his brand;--
    My fairest earldom would I give
    To bid Clan-Alpine's Chieftain live!--
    Hast thou no other boon to crave?Blushing, she turn'd her from the King,
    And to the Douglas gave the ring,
    As if she wish'd her sire to speak
    The suit that stain'd her glowing cheek.--
    "Nay, then, my pledge has lost its force,
    And stubborn Justice holds her course.--
    Malcolm, come forth!"--and, at the word,
    Down kneel'd the Graeme to Scotland's Lord."For thee, rash youth, no suppliant sues,
    From thee may Vengeance claim her dues,
    Who, nurtured underneath our smile,
    Hast paid our care by treacherous wile,
    And sought, amid thy faithful clan,
    A refuge for an outlaw'd man,
    Dishonoring thus thy loyal name.--
    Fetters and warder for the Graeme!"--
    His chain of gold the King unstrung,
    The links o'er Malcolm's neck he flung,
    Then gently drew the glittering band,
    And laid the clasp on Ellen's hand.The hills grow dark,
      On purple peaks a deeper shade descending;
    In twilight copse the glowworm lights her spark,
      The deer, half seen, are to the covert wending.the fountain lending,
      And the wild breeze, thy wilder minstrelsy;
    Thy numbers sweet with Nature's vespers blending,
      With distant echo from the fold and lea,
    And herd-boy's evening pipe, and hum of housing[362] bee.Yet, once again, farewell, thou Minstrel Harp!Yet, once again, forgive my feeble sway!And little reck I of the censure sharp
      May idly cavil at an idle lay.Much have I owed thy strains on life's long way,
      Through secret woes the world has never known,
    When on the weary night dawn'd wearier day,
      And bitterer was the grief devour'd alone.That I o'erlived such woes, Enchantress!as my lingering footsteps slow retire,
      Some Spirit of the Air has waked thy string!'Tis now a seraph bold, with touch of fire--
      'Tis now the brush of Fairy's frolic wing.Receding now, the dying numbers ring
      Fainter and fainter down the rugged dell,
    And now the mountain breezes scarcely bring
      A wandering witch note of the distant spell--
    And now, 'tis silent all!--Enchantress, fare thee well!A series of arches supported by columns or piers, either open
or backed by masonry.A kind of cap or head gear formerly worn by soldiers.A wall or rampart around the top of a castle, with openings
to look through and annoy the enemy.A capacious drinking cup or can formerly made of waxed
leather.A person knighted on some other ground than that of
military service; a knight who has not known the hardships of war.To grapple; to come to close quarters in fight.A kind of cap worn by Scottish matrons.The plume or decoration on the top of a helmet.The ridge of the neck of a horse or dog.A bridge at the entrance of a castle, which, when lowered
by chains, gave access across the moat or ditch surrounding the

intended to strike another.Pertaining to that political form in which there was a chain of
persons holding land of one another on condition of performing certain
services.Every man in the chain was bound to his immediate superior,
held land from him, took oath of allegiance to him, and became his man.A trumpet call; a fanfare or prelude by one or more trumpets
performed on the approach of any person of distinction.The front of a stag's head; the horns.A long-handled weapon armed with a steel point, and having a
crosspiece of steel with a cutting edge.An upper garment of leather, worn for defense by common soldiers.It was sometimes strengthened by small pieces of metal stitched into it."To give law" to a stag is to allow it a start of a certain
distance or time before the hounds are slipped, the object being to
insure a long chase.A cage for hawks while mewing or moulting: hence an inclosure, a
place of confinement.In the Roman Catholic Church the first canonical hour of prayer,
six o'clock in the morning, generally the first quarter of the day.A stout staff used as a weapon of defense.In using it,
one hand was placed in the middle, and the other halfway between the

fur for garments.A guarding or defensive position or motion in fencing._The Lady of the Lake_ is usually read in the first year of the high
school course, and it is with this fact in mind that the following
suggestions have been made.It is an excellent book with which to begin
the study of the ordinary forms of poetry, of plot structure, and the
simpler problems of description.For this reason in the exercises that
follow the emphasis has been placed on these topics._The Lady of the Lake_ is an excellent example of the minor epic.Corresponding to the "Arms and the man I sing," of the AEneid, and the
invocation to the Muse, are the statement of the theme, "Knighthood's
dauntless deed and Beauty's matchless eye," and the invocation to the
Harp of the North, in the opening stanzas.For the heroes, descendants
of the gods, of the great epic, we have a king, the chieftain of a
great clan, an outlaw earl and his daughter, characters less elevated
than those of the great epic, but still important.The element of the
supernatural brought in by the gods and goddesses of the epic is here
supplied by the minstrel, Brian the priest, and the harp.The interest
of the poem lies in the incidents as with the epic.The romantic story
of Ellen and Malcolm, however, lies quite outside the realm of the
great epic, which is concerned with the fate of a state or body of
people rather than with that of an individual.There are two threads to the story, one concerned with the love story
of Ellen and Malcolm, the main plot; and one with Roderick and his clan
against the King, the minor plot.The connection between them is very
slight, the story of Ellen could have been told almost without the
other, but the struggle of the Clan makes a fine background for the
love story of Ellen and Malcolm.The plot is an excellent one for the
beginner to study as the structure is so evident.The following is a
simple outline of the main incidents of the story.The coming of the stranger, later supposed by Roderick to
      be a spy of the King.The return of Douglas, guided by Malcolm, an act which
      brings Malcolm under the displeasure of the King.Roderick's proposal for Ellen's hand in order to avert the
      danger threatening Ellen and Douglas because of the recognition
      of the latter by the King's men.The rejection of the proposal, leading to the withdrawal of
      Ellen and her father to Coir-Uriskin and the departure of
      Douglas to the court to save Roderick and Malcolm.The preparations for war made by Roderick, including the
      sending of the Fiery Cross, and the Taghairm.Ellen and Allan-Bane at Coir-Uriskin.Douglas on his way to give himself up.The triumph of Fitz-James over Roderick.The interest reawakened in the King by Douglas's prowess
      and generosity.The battle of Beal 'an Duine.All of Scott's works afford excellent models of description for the
beginner in this very difficult form of composition.He deals with
the problems of description in a simple and evident manner.In most
cases he begins his description with the point of view, and chooses
the details in accordance with that point of view.The principle of
order used in the arrangement of the details is usually easy to find
and follow, and the beauty of his contrasts, the vanity and vividness
of his diction can be in a measure appreciated even by boys and girls
in the first year of the high school.If properly taught a pupil must
leave the study of the poem with a new sense of the power of words.In his description of character Scott deals with the most simple and
elemental emotions and is therefore fairly easy to imitate.In the
special topics under each canto special emphasis has been laid upon
description because of the adaptability of _his_ description to the needs
of the student.SPECIAL STUDIES IN THE CANTOS.CANTO I.

TEACHERS' OUTLINES FOR STUDIES IN ENGLISH

Based on the Requirements for Admission to College

By GILBERT SYKES BLAKELY, A.M., Instructor in English in the Morris
High School, New York City.This little book is intended to present to teachers plans for the study
of the English texts required for admission to college.These Outlines
are full of inspiration and suggestion, and will be welcomed by every
live teacher who hitherto, in order to avoid ruts, has been obliged to
compare notes with other teachers, visit classes, and note methods.The volume aims not at a discussion of the principles of teaching, but
at an application of certain principles to the teaching of some of the
books most generally read in schools.¶ The references by page and line to the book under discussion are to
the texts of the Gateway Series; but the Outlines can be used with any
series of English classics.¶ Certain brief plans of study are developed for the general teaching
of the novel, narrative poetry, lyric poetry, the drama, and the
essay.The suggestions are those of a practical teacher, and follow a
definite scheme in each work to be studied.There are discussions of
methods, topics for compositions, and questions for review.The lists
of questions are by no means exhaustive, but those that are given are
suggestive and typical.¶ The appendix contains twenty examinations in English, for admission
to college, recently set by different colleges in both the East and the
West.AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY

HALLECK'S NEW ENGLISH LITERATURE

By REUBEN POST HALLECK, M. A., LL.D. author of History of English
Literature, and History of American Literature.This New English Literature preserves the qualities which have caused
the author's former History of English Literature to be so widely used;
namely, suggestiveness, clearness, organic unity, interest, and power
to awaken thought and to stimulate the student to further reading.¶ Here are presented the new facts which have recently been brought
to light, and the new points of view which have been adopted.More
attention is paid to recent writers.The present critical point of
view concerning authors, which has been brought about by the new
social spirit, is reflected.Many new and important facts concerning
the Elizabethan theater and the drama of Shakespeare's time are
incorporated.¶ Other special features are the unusually detailed Suggested Readings
that follow each chapter, suggestions and references for a literary
trip to England, historical introductions to the chapters, careful
treatment of the modern drama, and a new and up-to-date bibliography.¶ Over 200 pictures selected for their pedagogical value and their
unusual character appear in their appropriate places in connection with
the text.The frontispiece, in colors, shows the performance of an
Elizabethan play in the Fortune Theater.AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY

A HISTORY OF AMERICAN LITERATURE

By REUBEN POST HALLECK, M.A., Principal, Male High School, Louisville,
Ky.A companion volume to the author's History of English Literature.It describes the greatest achievements in American literature from
colonial times to the present, placing emphasis not only upon men,
but also upon literary movements, the causes of which are thoroughly
investigated.Further, the relation of each period of American
literature to the corresponding epoch of English literature has been
carefully brought out--and each period is illuminated by a brief survey
of its history.¶ The seven chapters of the book treat in succession of Colonial
Literature, The Emergence of a Nation (1754-1809), the New York Group,
The New England Group, Southern Literature, Western Literature, and
the Eastern Realists.To these are added a supplementary list of less
important authors and their chief works, as well as A Glance Backward,
which emphasizes in brief compass the most important truths taught by
American literature.¶ At the end of each chapter is a summary which helps to fix the
period in mind by briefly reviewing the most significant achievements.This is followed by extensive historical and literary references for
further study, by a very helpful list of suggested readings, and by
questions and suggestions, designed to stimulate the student's interest
and enthusiasm, and to lead him to study and investigate further for
himself the remarkable literary record of American aspiration and
accomplishment.AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY

Transcriber's Notes:

     Underscores "_" before and after a word or phrase indicate italics
       in the original text.The word "onomatopoeia" uses an "oe" ligature in the original.A few words use diacritical characters in the original.We returned from Burrow Green to London, staying some
time at Audley End to see that fine palace.It is indeed a cheerful
piece of Gothic building, or rather _antico moderno_, but placed in an
obscure bottom.The cellars and galleries are very stately.It has a
river by it, a pretty avenue of limes, and in a park.This is in Saffron Walden parish, famous for that useful plant, with
which all the country is covered.[Sidenote: LONDON]

Dining at Bishop Stortford, we came late to London.There was sent me by a neighbor a servant maid, who,
in the last month, as she was sitting before her mistress at work, felt
a stroke on her arm a little above the wrist for some height, the smart
of which, as if struck by another hand, caused her to hold her arm
awhile till somewhat mitigated; but it put her into a kind of
convulsion, or rather hysteric fit.A gentleman coming casually in,
looking on her arm, found that part powdered with red crosses, set in
most exact and wonderful order, neither swelled nor depressed, about
this shape,

          x

not seeming to be any way made by artifice, of a reddish color, not so
red as blood, the skin over them smooth, the rest of the arm livid and
of a mortified hue, with certain prints, as it were, of the stroke of
fingers.This had happened three several times in July, at about ten
days' interval, the crosses beginning to wear out, but the successive
ones set in other different, yet uniform order.The maid seemed very
modest, and came from London to Deptford with her mistress, to avoid the
discourse and importunity of curious people.She made no gain by it,
pretended no religious fancies; but seemed to be a plain, ordinary,
silent, working wench, somewhat fat, short, and high-.She told
me divers divines and physicians had seen her, but were unsatisfied;
that she had taken some remedies against her fits, but they did her no
good; she had never before had any fits; once since, she seemed in her
sleep to hear one say to her that she should tamper no more with them,
nor trouble herself with anything that happened, but put her trust in
the merits of Christ only.This is the substance of what she told me, and what I saw and curiously
examined.I was formerly acquainted with the impostorious nuns of
Loudun, in France, which made such noise among the <DW7>s; I therefore
thought this worth the notice.I remember Monsieur Monconys[19] (that
curious traveler and a Roman Catholic) was by no means satisfied with
the _stigmata_ of those nuns, because they were so shy of letting him
scrape the letters, which were Jesus, Maria, Joseph (as I think),
observing they began to scale off with it, whereas this poor wench was
willing to submit to any trial; so that I profess I know not what to
think of it, nor dare I pronounce it anything supernatural.[Footnote 19: Balthasar de Monconys, a Frenchman, celebrated for his
    travels in the East, which he published in three volumes.His object
    was to discover vestiges of the philosophy of Trismegistus and
    Zoroaster; in which, it is hardly necessary to add, he was not very
    successful.]At Windsor I supped with the Duke of Monmouth; and,
the next day, invited by Lord Arlington, dined with the same Duke and
divers Lords.After dinner my Lord and I had a conference of more than
an hour alone in his bedchamber, to engage me in the History.I showed
him something that I had drawn up, to his great satisfaction, and he
desired me to show it to the Treasurer.One of the Canons preached; then followed the
offering of the Knights of the Order, according to custom; first the
poor Knights, in procession, then, the Canons in their formalities, the
Dean and Chancellor, then his Majesty (the Sovereign), the Duke of York,
Prince Rupert; and, lastly, the Earl of Oxford, being all the Knights
that were then at Court.I dined with the Treasurer, and consulted with him what pieces I was to
add; in the afternoon the King took me aside into the balcony over the
terrace, extremely pleased with what had been told him I had begun, in
order to his commands, and enjoining me to proceed vigorously in it.He
told me he had ordered the Secretaries of State to give me all necessary
assistance of papers and particulars relating to it and enjoining me to
make it a LITTLE KEEN, for that the Hollanders had very unhandsomely
abused him in their pictures, books, and libels.Windsor was now going to be repaired, being exceedingly ragged and
ruinous.Prince Rupert, the Constable, had begun to trim up the keep or
high round Tower, and handsomely adorned his hall with furniture of
arms, which was very singular, by so disposing the pikes, muskets,
pistols, bandoleers, holsters, drums, back, breast, and headpieces, as
was very extraordinary.Thus, those huge steep stairs ascending to it
had the walls invested with this martial furniture, all new and bright,
so disposing the bandoleers, holsters, and drums, as to represent
festoons, and that without any confusion, trophy-like.From the hall we
went into his bedchamber, and ample rooms hung with tapestry, curious
and effeminate pictures, so extremely different from the other, which
presented nothing but war and horror.The King passed most of his time in hunting the stag, and walking in the
park, which he was now planting with rows of trees.To visit Sir Richard Lashford, my kinsman, and Mr.Charles Howard, at his extraordinary garden, at Deepden.Arthur Onslow, at West
Clandon, a pretty dry seat on the Downs, where we dined in his great
room.Hussey, who, being near Wotton, lives
in a sweet valley, deliciously watered.To Albury, to see how that garden proceeded, which
I found exactly done to the design and plot I had made, with the crypta
through the mountain in the park, thirty perches in length.Such a
Pausilippe[20] is nowhere in England.The canal was now digging, and the
vineyard planted.[Footnote 20: A word adopted by Evelyn for a subterranean passage,
    from the famous grot of Pausilippo, at Naples.]I spent the whole afternoon in private with the
Treasurer who put into my hands those secret pieces and transactions
concerning the Dutch war, and particularly the expedition of Bergen, in
which he had himself the chief part, and gave me instructions, till the
King arriving from Newmarket, we both went up into his bedchamber.Dined with the Treasurer; and, after dinner, we
were shut up together.I received other [further] advices, and ten paper
books of dispatches and treaties; to return which again I gave a note
under my hand to Mr.I was this morning fifty years of age; the Lord
teach me to number my days so as to apply them to his glory!Saw the Prince of Orange, newly come to see the
King, his uncle; he has a manly, courageous, wise countenance,
resembling his mother and the Duke of Gloucester, both deceased.I now also saw that famous beauty, but in my opinion of a childish,
simple, and baby face, Mademoiselle Querouaille,[21] lately Maid of
Honor to Madame, and now to be so to the Queen.[Footnote 21: Henrietta, the King's sister, married to Philip, Duke
    of Orleans, was then on a visit here.Madame Querouaille came over
    in her train, on purpose to entice Charles into an union with Louis
    XIV.; a design which unhappily succeeded but too well.She became
    the King's mistress, was made Duchess of Portsmouth, and was his
    favorite till his death.]Dined with the Earl of Arlington, where was the
Venetian Ambassador, of whom I now took solemn leave, now on his return.There were also Lords Howard, Wharton, Windsor, and divers other great
persons.I dined with the Treasurer, where was the Earl of
Rochester, a very profane wit.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th December, 1670.It was the thickest and darkest fog on the Thames
that was ever known in the memory of man, and I happened to be in the
very midst of it.I supped with Monsieur Zulestein, late Governor to the
late Prince of Orange.Bohun, my son's tutor, had been five years in
my house, and now Bachelor of Laws, and Fellow of New College, went from
me to Oxford to reside there, having well and faithfully performed his
charge.This day I first acquainted his Majesty with that
incomparable young man, Gibbon,[22] whom I had lately met with in an
obscure place by mere accident, as I was walking near a poor solitary
thatched house, in a field in our parish, near Sayes Court.I found him
shut in; but looking in at the window, I perceived him carving that
large cartoon, or crucifix, of Tintoretto, a copy of which I had myself
brought from Venice, where the original painting remains.I asked if I
might enter; he opened the door civilly to me, and I saw him about such
a work as for the curiosity of handling, drawing, and studious
exactness, I never had before seen in all my travels.I questioned him
why he worked in such an obscure and lonesome place; he told me it was
that he might apply himself to his profession without interruption, and
wondered not a little how I found him out.I asked if he was unwilling
to be made known to some great man, for that I believed it might turn to
his profit; he answered, he was yet but a beginner, but would not be
sorry to sell off that piece; on demanding the price, he said L100.In
good earnest, the very frame was worth the money, there being nothing in
nature so tender and delicate as the flowers and festoons about it, and
yet the work was very strong; in the piece was more than one hundred
figures of men, etc.I found he was likewise musical, and very civil,
sober, and discreet in his discourse.There was only an old woman in the
house.So, desiring leave to visit him sometimes, I went away.[Footnote 22: Better known by the name of Grinling Gibbon;
    celebrated for his exquisite carving.Some of his most astonishing
    work is at Chatsworth and at Petworth.]Of this young artist, together with my manner of finding him out, I
acquainted the King, and begged that he would give me leave to bring him
and his work to Whitehall, for that I would adventure my reputation with
his Majesty that he had never seen anything approach it, and that he
would be exceedingly pleased, and employ him.The King said he would
himself go see him.This was the first notice his Majesty ever had of
Mr.The King came to me in the Queen's withdrawing-room
from the circle of ladies, to talk with me as to what advance I had made
in the Dutch History.I dined with the Treasurer, and afterward we went
to the Secretary's Office, where we conferred about divers particulars.I was directed to go to Sir George Downing, who
having been a public minister in Holland, at the beginning of the war,
was to give me light in some material passages.This year the weather was so wet, stormy, and unseasonable, as had not
been known in many years.I saw the great ball danced by the Queen and
distinguished ladies at Whitehall Theater.Next day; was acted there the
famous play, called, "The Siege of Granada," two days acted
successively; there were indeed very glorious scenes and perspectives,
the work of Mr.[23]

    [Footnote 23: Evelyn here refers to Dryden's "Conquest of Granada".]Pepys, Clerk of the Acts, two extraordinary,
ingenious, and knowing persons, and other friends.I carried them to see
the piece of carving which I had recommended to the King.Came to visit me one of the Lords Commissioners of
Scotland for the Union.The Treasurer acquainted me that his Majesty was
graciously pleased to nominate me one of the Council of Foreign
Plantations, and give me a salary of L500 per annum, to encourage me.I went to thank the Treasurer, who was my great
friend and loved me; I dined with him and much company, and went thence
to my Lord Arlington, Secretary of State, in whose favor I likewise was
upon many occasions, though I cultivated neither of their friendships by
any mean submissions.I kissed his Majesty's hand, on his making me one
of the new-established Council.[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st March, 1671.Gibbon to bring to Whitehall his
excellent piece of carving, where being come, I advertised his Majesty,
who asked me where it was; I told him in Sir Richard Browne's (my
father-in-law) chamber, and that if it pleased his Majesty to appoint
whither it should be brought, being large and though of wood, heavy, I
would take care for it."No," says the King, "show me the way, I'll go
to Sir Richard's chamber," which he immediately did, walking along the
entries after me; as far as the ewry, till he came up into the room,
where I also lay.No sooner was he entered and cast his eyes on the
work, but he was astonished at the curiosity of it; and having
considered it a long time, and discoursed with Mr.Gibbon, whom I
brought to kiss his hand, he commanded it should be immediately carried
to the Queen's side to show her.It was carried up into her bedchamber,
where she and the King looked on and admired it again; the King, being
called away, left us with the Queen, believing she would have bought it,
it being a crucifix; but, when his Majesty was gone, a French peddling
woman, one Madame de Boord, who used to bring petticoats and fans, and
baubles, out of France to the ladies, began to find fault with several
things in the work, which she understood no more than an ass, or a
monkey, so as in a kind of indignation, I caused the person who brought
it to carry it back to the chamber, finding the Queen so much governed
by an ignorant Frenchwoman, and this incomparable artist had his labor
only for his pains, which not a little displeased me; and he was fain to
send it down to his cottage again; he not long after sold it for L80,
though well worth L100, without the frame, to Sir George Viner.Wren, faithfully promised me to employ
him.[24] I having also bespoke his Majesty for his work at Windsor,
which my friend, Mr.May, the architect there, was going to alter, and
repair universally; for, on the next day, I had a fair opportunity of
talking to his Majesty about it, in the lobby next the Queen's side,
where I presented him with some sheets of my history.James's Park to the garden, where I both saw and
heard a very familiar discourse between... and Mrs.Nelly,[25] as they
called an impudent comedian, she looking out of her garden on a terrace
at the top of the wall, and... standing on the green walk under it.I
was heartily sorry at this scene.Thence the King walked to the Duchess
of Cleveland, another lady of pleasure, and curse of our nation.[Footnote 24: The carving in the choir, etc., of St.Paul's
    Cathedral was executed by Gibbon.][Footnote 25: Nell Gwynne: there can be no doubt as to the name with
    which we are to fill up these blanks.This familiar interview of
    Nelly and the King has afforded a subject for painters.]I dined at Greenwich, to take leave of Sir Thomas
Linch, going Governor of Jamaica.To London, about passing my patent as one of the
standing Council for Plantations, a considerable honor, the others in
the Council being chiefly noblemen and officers of state.[Illustration: _NELL GWYNNE_

_Photogravure after Sir Peter Lely_]

2d April, 1671.To Sir Thomas Clifford, the Treasurer, to condole with
him on the loss of his eldest son, who died at Florence.The French King, being now with a great army of 28,000 men
about Dunkirk, divers of the grandees of that Court, and a vast number
of gentlemen and cadets, in fantastical habits, came flocking over to
see our Court and compliment his Majesty.I was present, when they first
were conducted into the Queen's withdrawing-room, where saluted their
Majesties the Dukes of Guise, Longueville, and many others of the first
rank.Treasurer's,[26] in company with Monsieur
De Grammont and several French noblemen, and one Blood, that impudent,
bold fellow who had not long before attempted to steal the imperial
crown itself out of the Tower, pretending only curiosity of seeing the
regalia there, when, stabbing the keeper, though not mortally, he boldly
went away with it through all the guards, taken only by the accident of
his horse falling down.How he came to be pardoned, and even received
into favor, not only after this, but several other exploits almost as
daring both in Ireland and here, I could never come to understand.Some
believed he became a spy of several parties, being well with the
sectaries and enthusiasts, and did his Majesty services that way, which
none alive could do so well as he; but it was certainly the boldest
attempt, so the only treason of this sort that was ever pardoned.This
man had not only a daring but a villanous, unmerciful look, a false
countenance, but very well-spoken and dangerously insinuating.[Footnote 26: This entry of 10th May, 1671, so far as it relates to
    Blood, and the stealing of the crown, etc., is a mistake.Blood
    stole the crown on the 9th of May, 1671--the very day before; and
    the "not long before" of Evelyn, and the circumstance of his being
    "pardoned," which Evelyn also mentions, can hardly be said to relate
    to only the day before.]I went to Eltham, to sit as one of the commissioners
about the subsidy now given by Parliament to his Majesty.Treasurer's [Sir Thomas Clifford] with
the Earl of Arlington, Carlingford, Lord Arundel of Wardour, Lord
Almoner to the Queen, a French Count and two abbots, with several more
of French nobility; and now by something I had lately observed of Mr.Treasurer's conversation on occasion, I suspected him a little warping
to Rome.I dined at a feast made for me and my wife by the
Trinity Company, for our passing a fine of the land which Sir R. Browne,
my wife's father, freely gave to found and build their college, or
almshouses on, at Deptford, it being my wife's after her father's
decease.It was a good and charitable work and gift, but would have been
better bestowed on the poor of that parish, than on the seamen's widows,
the Trinity Company being very rich, and the rest of the poor of the
parish exceedingly indigent.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th May, 1671.The Earl of Bristol's house in Queen's Street
[Lincoln's Inn Fields] was taken for the Commissioners of Trade and
Plantations, and furnished with rich hangings of the King's.It
consisted of seven rooms on a floor, with a long gallery, gardens, etc.This day we met the Duke of Buckingham, Earl of Lauderdale, Lord
Culpeper, Sir George Carteret, Vice-Chamberlain, and myself, had the
oaths given us by the Earl of Sandwich, our President.It was to advise
and counsel his Majesty, to the best of our abilities, for the
well-governing of his Foreign Plantations, etc., the form very little
differing from that given to the Privy Council.We then took our places
at the Board in the Council-Chamber, a very large room furnished with
atlases, maps, charts, globes, etc.Then came the Lord Keeper, Sir
Orlando Bridgeman, Earl of Arlington, Secretary of State, Lord Ashley,
Mr.Treasurer, Sir John Trevor, the other Secretary, Sir John Duncomb,
Lord Allington, Mr.Grey, son to the Lord Grey, Mr.Henry Broncher, Sir
Humphrey Winch, Sir John Finch, Mr.Waller, and Colonel Titus, of the
bedchamber, with Mr.Slingsby, Secretary to the Council, and two Clerks
of the Council, who had all been sworn some days before.Being all set,
our Patent was read, and then the additional Patent, in which was
recited this new establishment; then, was delivered to each a copy of
the Patent, and of instructions: after which, we proceeded to business.The first thing we did was, to settle the form of a circular letter to
the Governors of all his Majesty's Plantations and Territories in the
West Indies and Islands thereof, to give them notice to whom they should
apply themselves on all occasions, and to render us an account of their
present state and government; but, what we most insisted on was, to know
the condition of New England, which appearing to be very independent as
to their regard to Old England, or his Majesty, rich and strong as they
now were, there were great debates in what style to write to them; for
the condition of that Colony was such, that they were able to contest
with all other Plantations about them, and there was fear of their
breaking from all dependence on this nation; his Majesty, therefore,
commended this affair more expressly.We, therefore, thought fit, in the
first place, to acquaint ourselves as well as we could of the state of
that place, by some whom we heard of that were newly come from thence,
and to be informed of their present posture and condition; some of our
Council were for sending them a menacing letter, which those who better
understood the peevish and touchy humor of that Colony, were utterly
against.A letter was then read from Sir Thomas Modiford, Governor of Jamaica;
and then the Council broke up.Having brought an action against one Cocke, for money which he had
received for me, it had been referred to an arbitration by the
recommendation of that excellent good man, the Chief-Justice Hale,[27]
but, this not succeeding, I went to advise with that famous lawyer, Mr.Jones, of Gray's Inn, and, 27th of May, had a trial before Lord Chief
Justice Hale; and, after the lawyers had wrangled sufficiently, it was
referred to a new arbitration.This was the very first suit at law that
ever I had with any creature, and oh, that it might be the last![Footnote 27: Sir Matthew Hale, so famous as one of the justices of
    the bench in Cromwell's time.After the Restoration, he became Chief
    Baron of the Exchequer; then Chief Justice of the King's Bench, and
    died in 1676.The author of numerous works, not only on professional
    subjects, but on mathematics and philosophy.]I went to Council, where was produced a most exact and
ample information of the state of Jamaica, and of the best expedients as
to New England, on which there was a long debate; but at length it was
concluded that, if any, it should be only a conciliating paper at first,
or civil letter, till we had better information of the present face of
things, since we understood they were a people almost upon the very
brink of renouncing any dependence on the Crown.To a splendid dinner at the great room in Deptford
Trinity House, Sir Thomas Allen chosen Master, and succeeding the Earl
of Craven.[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th June, 1671.To carry Colonel Middleton to Whitehall, to my Lord
Sandwich, our President, for some information which he was able to give
of the state of the Colony in New England.To Council again, when one Colonel Cartwright, a
Nottinghamshire man, (formerly in commission with Colonel Nicholls) gave
us a considerable relation of that country; on which the Council
concluded that in the first place a letter of amnesty should be
dispatched.Constantine Huygens, Signor of Zuylichem, that
excellent learned man, poet, and musician, now near eighty years of age,
a vigorous, brisk man,[28] came to take leave of me before his return
into Holland with the Prince, whose Secretary he was.[Footnote 28: He died in 1687, at the great age of 90 years and 6
    months.Constantine and his son, Christian Huygens, were both
    eminent for scientific knowledge and classical attainments;
    Christian, particularly so; for he was the inventor of the pendulum,
    made an improvement in the air-pump, first discovered the ring and
    one of the satellites of Saturn, and ascertained the laws of
    collision of elastic bodies.Constantine, the
    father, was a person of influence and distinction in Holland, and
    held the post of secretary to the Prince of Orange.]To Council, where Lord Arlington acquainted us that it
was his Majesty's proposal we should, every one of us, contribute L20
toward building a Council chamber and conveniences somewhere in
Whitehall, that his Majesty might come and sit among us, and hear our
debates; the money we laid out to be reimbursed out of the contingent
moneys already set apart for us, viz, L1,000 yearly.To this we
unanimously consented.There came an uncertain bruit from Barbadoes of
some disorder there.On my return home I stepped in at the theater to
see the new machines for the intended scenes, which were indeed very
costly and magnificent.To Council, where were letters from Sir Thomas
Modiford, of the expedition and exploit of Colonel Morgan, and others of
Jamaica, on the Spanish Continent at Panama.To Council, where we drew up and agreed to a letter to
be sent to New England, and made some proposal to Mr.Gorges, for his
interest in a plantation there.Surveyor brought us a plot for the
building of our Council chamber, to be erected at the end of the Privy
garden, in Whitehall.The matter in debate
was, whether we should send a deputy to New England, requiring them of
the Massachusetts to restore such to their limits and respective
possessions, as had petitioned the Council; this to be the open
commission only; but, in truth, with secret instructions to inform us of
the condition of those Colonies, and whether they were of such power, as
to be able to resist his Majesty and declare for themselves as
independent of the Crown, which we were told, and which of late years
made them refractory.Colonel Middleton, being called in, assured us
they might be curbed by a few of his Majesty's first-rate frigates, to
spoil their trade with the islands; but, though my Lord President was
not satisfied, the rest were, and we did resolve to advise his Majesty
to send Commissioners with a formal commission for adjusting boundaries,
etc., with some other instructions.The letters of Sir Thomas Modiford were
read, giving relation of the exploit at Panama, which was very brave;
they took, burned, and pillaged the town of vast treasures, but the best
of the booty had been shipped off, and lay at anchor in the South Sea,
so that, after our men had ranged the country sixty miles about, they
went back to Nombre de Dios, and embarked for Jamaica.Such an action
had not been done since the famous Drake.I dined at the Hamburg Resident's, and, after dinner, went to the
christening of Sir Samuel Tuke's son, Charles, at Somerset House, by a
Popish priest, and many odd ceremonies.The godfathers were the King,
and Lord Arundel of Wardour, and godmother, the Countess of Huntingdon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

29th August, 1671.To London, with some more papers of my progress in
the Dutch War, delivered to the Treasurer.Dined with the Treasurer, in company with my Lord
Arlington, Halifax, and Sir Thomas Strickland; and next day, went home,
being the anniversary of the late dreadful fire of London.In the afternoon at Council, where letters were
read from Sir Charles Wheeler, concerning his resigning his government
of St.I dined in the city, at the fraternity feast in
Ironmongers' Hall, where the four stewards chose their successors for
the next year, with a solemn procession, garlands about their heads, and
music playing before them; so, coming up to the upper tables where the
gentlemen sat, they drank to the new stewards; and so we parted.I dined at the Treasurer's, where I had discourse
with Sir Henry Jones (now come over to raise a regiment of horse),
concerning the French conquests in Lorraine; he told me the King sold
all things to the soldiers, even to a handful of hay.After dinner, the Treasurer carried me to Lincoln's Inn, to one of the
Parliament Clerks, to obtain of him, that I might carry home and peruse,
some of the Journals, which were, accordingly, delivered to me to
examine about the late Dutch War.Returning home, I went on shore to see
the Custom House, now newly rebuilt since the dreadful conflagration.[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th and 10th October, 1671.I went, after evening service, to London,
in order to a journey of refreshment with Mr.Treasurer, to Newmarket,
where the King then was, in his coach with six brave horses, which we
changed thrice, first, at Bishop-Stortford, and last, at Chesterford;
so, by night, we got to Newmarket, where Mr.Henry Jermain (nephew to
the Earl of St.We proceeded immediately
to Court, the King and all the English gallants being there at their
autumnal sports.Supped at the Lord Chamberlain's; and, the next day,
after dinner, I was on the heath, where I saw the great match run
between Woodcock and Flatfoot, belonging to the King, and to Mr.Eliot,
of the bedchamber, many thousands being spectators; a more signal race
had not been run for many years.This over, I went that night with Mr.Treasurer to Euston, a palace of
Lord Arlington's, where we found Monsieur Colbert (the French
Ambassador), and the famous new French Maid of Honor, Mademoiselle
Querouaille, now coming to be in great favor with the King.Here was
also the Countess of Sunderland, and several lords and ladies, who
lodged in the house.During my stay here with Lord Arlington, near a fortnight, his Majesty
came almost every second day with the Duke, who commonly returned to
Newmarket, but the King often lay here, during which time I had twice
the honor to sit at dinner with him, with all freedom.It was
universally reported that the fair lady ----, was bedded one of these
nights, and the stocking flung, after the manner of a married bride; I
acknowledge she was for the most part in her undress all day, and that
there was fondness and toying with that young wanton; nay, it was said,
I was at the former ceremony; but it is utterly false; I neither saw nor
heard of any such thing while I was there, though I had been in her
chamber, and all over that apartment late enough, and was myself
observing all passages with much curiosity.However, it was with
confidence believed she was first made _a Miss_, as they called these
unhappy creatures, with solemnity at this time.On Sunday, a young Cambridge divine preached an excellent sermon in the
chapel, the King and the Duke of York being present.Came all the great men from Newmarket, and other
parts both of Suffolk and Norfolk, to make their court, the whole house
filled from one end to the other with lords, ladies, and gallants; there
was such a furnished table, as I had seldom seen, nor anything more
splendid and free, so that for fifteen days there were entertained at
least 200 people, and half as many horses, besides servants and guards,
at infinite expense.In the morning, we went hunting and hawking; in the afternoon, till
almost morning, to cards and dice, yet I must say without noise,
swearing, quarrel, or confusion of any sort.I, who was no gamester, had
often discourse with the French Ambassador, Colbert, and went sometimes
abroad on horseback with the ladies to take the air, and now and then to
hunting; thus idly passing the time, but not without more often recess
to my pretty apartment, where I was quite out of all this hurry, and had
leisure when I would, to converse with books, for there is no man more
hospitably easy to be withal than my Lord Arlington, of whose particular
friendship and kindness I had ever a more than ordinary share.His house
is a very noble pile, consisting of four pavilions after the French,
beside a body of a large house, and, though not built altogether, but
formed of additions to an old house (purchased by his Lordship of one
Sir T. Rookwood) yet with a vast expense made not only capable and
roomsome, but very magnificent and commodious, as well within as
without, nor less splendidly furnished.The staircase is very elegant,
the garden handsome, the canal beautiful, but the soil dry, barren, and
miserably sandy, which flies in drifts as the wind sits.Here my Lord
was pleased to advise with me about ordering his plantations of firs,
elms, limes, etc., up his park, and in all other places and avenues.I
persuaded him to bring his park so near as to comprehend his house
within it; which he resolved upon, it being now near a mile to it.The
water furnishing the fountains, is raised by a pretty engine, or very
slight plain wheels, which likewise serve to grind his corn, from a
small cascade of the canal, the invention of Sir Samuel Morland.In my
Lord's house, and especially above the staircase, in the great hall and
some of the chambers and rooms of state, are paintings in fresco by
Signor Verrio, being the first work which he did in England.[Sidenote: NORWICH]

17th October, 1671.My Lord Henry Howard coming this night to visit my
Lord Chamberlain, and staying a day, would needs have me go with him to
Norwich, promising to convey me back, after a day or two; this, as I
could not refuse, I was not hard to be pursuaded to, having a desire to
see that famous scholar and physician, Dr.T. Browne, author of the
"_Religio Medici_" and "Vulgar Errors," now lately knighted.Thither,
then, went my Lord and I alone, in his flying chariot with six horses;
and by the way, discoursing with me of several of his concerns, he
acquainted me of his going to marry his eldest son to one of the King's
natural daughters, by the Duchess of Cleveland; by which he reckoned he
should come into mighty favor.He also told me that, though he kept that
idle creature, Mrs.B----, and would leave L200 a year to the son he had
by her, he would never marry her, and that the King himself had
cautioned him against it.All the world knows how he kept his promise,
and I was sorry at heart to hear what now he confessed to me; and that a
person and a family which I so much honored for the sake of that noble
and illustrious friend of mine, his grandfather, should dishonor and
pollute them both with those base and vicious courses he of late had
taken since the death of Sir Samuel Tuke, and that of his own virtuous
lady (my Lady Anne Somerset, sister to the Marquis); who, while they
lived, preserved this gentleman by their example and advice from those
many extravagances that impaired both his fortune and reputation.Being come to the Ducal palace, my Lord made very much of me; but I had
little rest, so exceedingly desirous he was to show me the contrivance
he had made for the entertainment of their Majesties, and the whole
Court not long before, and which, though much of it was but temporary,
apparently framed of boards only, was yet standing.As to the palace, it
is an old wretched building, and that part of it newly built of brick,
is very ill understood; so as I was of the opinion it had been much
better to have demolished all, and set it up in a better place, than to
proceed any further; for it stands in the very market-place, and, though
near a river, yet a very narrow muddy one, without any extent.Next morning, I went to see Sir Thomas Browne (with whom I had some
time corresponded by letter, though I had never seen him before); his
whole house and garden being a paradise and cabinet of rarities; and
that of the best collection, especially medals, books, plants, and
natural things.Among other curiosities, Sir Thomas had a collection of
the eggs of all the fowl and birds he could procure, that country
(especially the promontory of Norfolk) being frequented, as he said, by
several kinds which seldom or never go further into the land, as cranes,
storks, eagles, and variety of water fowl.He led me to see all the
remarkable places of this ancient city, being one of the largest, and
certainly, after London, one of the noblest of England, for its
venerable cathedral, number of stately churches, cleanness of the
streets, and buildings of flint so exquisitely headed and squared, as I
was much astonished at; but he told me they had lost the art of squaring
the flints, in which they so much excelled, and of which the churches,
best houses, and walls, are built.The Castle is an antique extent of
ground, which now they call Marsfield, and would have been a fitting
area to have placed the Ducal palace in.The suburbs are large, the
prospects sweet, with other amenities, not omitting the flower gardens,
in which all the inhabitants excel.The fabric of stuffs brings a vast
trade to this populous town.Being returned to my Lord's, who had been with me all this morning, he
advised with me concerning a plot to rebuild his house, having already,
as he said, erected a front next the street, and a left wing, and now
resolving to set up another wing and pavilion next the garden, and to
convert the bowling green into stables.My advice was, to desist from
all, and to meditate wholly on rebuilding a handsome palace at Arundel
House, in the Strand, before he proceeded further here, and then to
place this in the Castle, that ground belonging to his Lordship.I observed that most of the church yards (though some of them large
enough) were filled up with earth, or rather the congestion of dead
bodies one upon another, for want of earth, even to the very top of the
walls, and some above the walls, so as the churches seemed to be built
in pits.I returned to Euston, in Lord Henry Howard's coach,
leaving him at Norwich, in company with a very ingenious gentleman, Mr.White, whose father and mother (daughter to the late Lord Treasurer
Weston, Earl of Portland) I knew at Rome, where this gentleman was born,
and where his parents lived and died with much reputation, during their
banishment in our civil broils.Quitting Euston, I lodged this night at Newmarket,
where I found the jolly blades racing, dancing, feasting, and reveling;
more resembling a luxurious and abandoned rout, than a Christian Court.The Duke of Buckingham was now in mighty favor, and had with him that
impudent woman, the Countess of Shrewsbury, with his band of fiddlers,
etc.Next morning, in company with Sir Bernard Gascoyne, and Lord Hawley, I
came in the Treasurer's coach to Bishop Stortford, where he gave us a
noble supper.The following day, to London, and so home.To Council, where Sir Charles Wheeler, late
Governor of the Leeward Islands, having been complained of for many
indiscreet managements, it was resolved, on scanning many of the
particulars, to advise his Majesty to remove him; and consult what was
to be done, to prevent these inconveniences he had brought things to.This business staid me in London almost a week, being in Council, or
Committee, every morning till the 25th.We ordered that a proclamation should be presented
to his Majesty to sign, against what Sir Charles Wheeler had done in St.Christopher's since the war, on the articles of peace at Breda.Came to visit me Sir William Haywood, a great
pretender to English antiquities.Went to see the Duke of Buckingham's ridiculous
farce and rhapsody, called the "The Recital,"[29] buffooning all plays,
yet profane enough.[Footnote 29: The well-known play of "The Rehearsal" is meant.]The Councillors of the Board of Trade dined together
at the Cock, in Suffolk street.His Majesty renewed us our lease of Sayes Court
pastures for ninety-nine years, but ought, according to his solemn
promise[30] (as I hope he will still perform), have passed them to us in
fee-farm.[Footnote 30: The King's engagement, under his hand, is now at
    Wotton.][Sidenote: LONDON]

23d January, 1672.To London, in order to Sir Richard Browne, my
father-in-law, resigning his place as Clerk of the Council to Joseph
Williamson, Esq., who was admitted, and was knighted.This place his
Majesty had promised to give me many years before; but, upon
consideration of the renewal of our lease and other reasons, I chose to
part with it to Sir Joseph, who gave us and the rest of his brother
clerks a handsome supper at his house; and, after supper, a concert of
music.An extraordinary snow; part of the week was taken up
in consulting about the commission of prisoners of war, and instructions
to our officers, in order to a second war with the Hollanders, his
Majesty having made choice of the former commissioners, and myself among
them.In the afternoon, that famous proselyte, Monsieur
Brevall, preached at the Abbey, in English, extremely well and with much
eloquence.He had been a Capuchin, but much better learned than most of
that order.At the Council, we entered on inquiries about
improving the plantations by silks, galls, flax, senna, etc., and
considered how nutmegs and cinnamon might be obtained and brought to
Jamaica, that soil and climate promising success.Worsley being
called in, spoke many considerable things to encourage it.We took order
to send to the plantations, that none of their ships should adventure
homeward single, but stay for company and convoys.We also deliberated
on some fit person to go as commissioner to inspect their actions in New
England, and, from time to time, report how that people stood affected.Parr, of Camberwell, preached a most pathetic
funeral discourse and panegyric at the interment of our late pastor, Dr.Breton (who died on the 18th), on "Happy is the servant whom, when his
Lord cometh," etc.This good man, among other expressions, professed
that he had never been so touched and concerned at any loss as at this,
unless at that of King Charles our martyr, and Archbishop Usher, whose
chaplain he had been.Breton had preached on the 28th and 30th of
January: on the Friday, having fasted all day, making his provisionary
sermon for the Sunday following, he went well to bed; but was taken
suddenly ill and expired before help could come to him.Never had a parish a greater loss, not only as he was an excellent
preacher, and fitted for our great and vulgar auditory, but for his
excellent life and charity, his meekness and obliging nature,
industrious, helpful, and full of good works.He left near L400 to the
poor in his will, and that what children of his should die in their
minority, their portion should be so employed, I lost in particular a
special friend, and one that had an extraordinary love for me and mine.[Sidenote: LONDON]

25th February, 1672.To London, to speak with the Bishop, and Sir John
Cutler, our patron, to present Mr.Frampton (afterward Bishop of
Gloucester).A full Council of Plantations, on the danger of the
Leeward Islands, threatened by the French, who had taken some of our
ships, and began to interrupt our trade.Also in debate, whether the new
Governor of St.Christopher should be subordinate to the Governor of
Barbadoes.Now was the first blow given by us to the Dutch convoy
of the Smyrna fleet, by Sir Robert Holmes and Lord Ossory, in which we
received little save blows, and a worthy reproach for attacking our
neighbors ere any war was proclaimed, and then pretending the occasion
to be, that some time before, the Merlin yacht chancing to sail through
the whole Dutch fleet, their Admiral did not strike to that trifling
vessel.Surely, this was a quarrel slenderly grounded, and not becoming
Christian neighbors.Lord Ossory
several times deplored to me his being engaged in it; he had more
justice and honor than in the least to approve of it, though he had been
over-persuaded to the expedition.There is no doubt but we should have
surprised this exceeding rich fleet, had not the avarice and ambition of
Holmes and Spragge separated themselves, and willfully divided our
fleet, on presumption that either of them was strong enough to deal with
the Dutch convoy without joining and mutual help; but they so warmly
plied our divided fleets, that while in conflict the merchants sailed
away, and got safe into Holland.A few days before this, the Treasurer of the Household, Sir Thomas
Clifford, hinted to me, as a confidant, that his Majesty would SHUT UP
THE EXCHEQUER (and, accordingly, his Majesty made use of infinite
treasure there, to prepare for an intended rupture); but, says he, it
will soon be open again, and everybody satisfied; for this bold man, who
had been the sole adviser of the King to invade that sacred stock
(though some pretend it was Lord Ashley's counsel, then Chancellor of
the Exchequer), was so over-confident of the success of this unworthy
design against the Smyrna merchants, as to put his Majesty on an action
which not only lost the hearts of his subjects, and ruined many widows
and orphans, whose stocks were lent him, but the reputation of his
Exchequer forever, it being before in such credit, that he might have
commanded half the wealth of the nation.The credit of this bank being thus broken, did exceedingly discontent
the people, and never did his Majesty's affairs prosper to any purpose
after it, for as it did not supply the expense of the meditated war, so
it melted away, I know not how.To this succeeded the King's declaration for an universal toleration;
<DW7>s and swarms of Sectaries, now boldly showing themselves in their
public meetings.This was imputed to the same council, Clifford warping
to Rome as was believed, nor was Lord Arlington clear of suspicion, to
gratify that party, but as since it has proved, and was then evidently
foreseen, to the extreme weakening of the Church of England and its
Episcopal Government, as it was projected.I speak not this as my own
sense, but what was the discourse and thoughts of others, who were
lookers-on; for I think there might be some relaxations without the
least prejudice to the present establishment, discreetly limited, but to
let go the reins in this manner, and then to imagine they could take
them up again as easily, was a false policy, and greatly destructive.The truth is, our Bishops slipped the occasion; for, had they held a
steady hand upon his Majesty's restoration, as they might easily have
done, the Church of England had emerged and flourished, without
interruption; but they were then remiss, and covetous after advantages
of another kind while his Majesty suffered them to come into a harvest,
with which, without any injustice he might have remunerated innumerable
gallant gentlemen for their services who had ruined themselves in the
late rebellion.I visited the coasts in my district of Kent, and
divers wounded and languishing poor men, that had been in the Smyrna
conflict.I went over to see the new-begun Fort of Tilbury; a royal
work, indeed, and such as will one day bridle a great city to the
purpose, before they are aware.Captain Cox, one of the Commissioners of the Navy,
furnishing me with a yatch, I sailed to Sheerness to see that fort also,
now newly finished; several places on both sides the Swale and Medway to
Gillingham and Upnore, being also provided with redoubts and batteries
to secure the station of our men-of-war at Chatham, and shut the door
when the steeds were stolen.I saw the chirurgeon cut off the leg of a wounded
sailor, the stout and gallant man enduring it with incredible patience,
without being bound to his chair, as usual on such painful occasions.I
had hardly courage enough to be present.Not being cut off high enough
the gangrene prevailed, and the second operation cost the poor creature
his life.what miseries are mortal men subject to, and what confusion and
mischief do the avarice, anger, and ambition of Princes, cause in the
world!I proceeded to Canterbury, Dover, Deal, the Isle of
Thanet, by Sandwich, and so to Margate.Here we had abundance of
miserably wounded men, his Majesty sending his chief chirurgeon,
Sergeant Knight, to meet me, and Dr.Waldrond had attended me all the
journey.Having taken order for the accommodation of the wounded, I came
back through a country the best cultivated of any that in my life I had
anywhere seen, every field lying as even as a bowling-green, and the
fences, plantations, and husbandry, in such admirable order, as
infinitely delighted me, after the sad and afflicting spectacles and
objects I was come from.Observing almost every tall tree to have a
weathercock on the top bough, and some trees half-a-dozen, I learned
that, on a certain holyday, the farmers feast their servants; at which
solemnity, they set up these cocks, in a kind of triumph.[Sidenote: ROCHESTER]

Being come back toward Rochester, I went to take order respecting the
building a strong and high wall about a house I had hired of a
gentleman, at a place called Hartlip, for a prison, paying L50 yearly
rent.Here I settled a Provost-Marshal and other officers, returning by
Feversham.On the 30th heard a sermon in Rochester cathedral, and so got
to Sayes Court on the first of April.I went to see the fopperies of the <DW7>s at
Somerset-House and York-House, where now the French Ambassador had
caused to be represented our Blessed Savior at the Pascal Supper with
his disciples, in figures and puppets made as big as the life, of
wax-work, curiously clad and sitting round a large table, the room nobly
hung, and shining with innumerable lamps and candles: this was exposed
to all the world; all the city came to see it.Such liberty had the
Roman Catholics at this time obtained.Sat in Council, preparing Lord Willoughby's commission
and instructions as Governor of Barbadoes and the Caribbee Islands.At Council, preparing instructions for Colonel
Stapleton, now to go Governor of St.Christopher's, and heard the
complaints of the Jamaica merchants against the Spaniards, for hindering
them from cutting logwood on the mainland, where they have no pretense.To my Lord of Canterbury, to entreat him to engage Sir
John Cutler, the patron, to provide us a grave and learned man, in
opposition to a novice.Treasurer Clifford's new honor,
being made a Baron.My son, John, was specially admitted of the Middle Temple
by Sir Francis North, his Majesty's Solicitor-General, and since
Chancellor.I pray God bless this beginning, my intention being that he
should seriously apply himself to the study of the law.I was ordered, by letter from the Council, to repair
forthwith to his Majesty, whom I found in the Pall-Mall, in St.James's
Park, where his Majesty coming to me from the company, commanded me to
go immediately to the seacoast, and to observe the motion of the Dutch
fleet and ours, the Duke and so many of the flower of our nation being
now under sail, coming from Portsmouth, through the Downs, where it was
believed there might be an encounter.Heard a sermon in Rochester
Cathedral.Bargrave, my old
fellow-traveler in Italy, and great virtuoso.To Dover; but the fleet did not appear till the 16th,
when the Duke of York with his and the French squadron, in all 170 ships
(of which above 100 were men-of-war), sailed by, after the Dutch, who
were newly withdrawn.Such a gallant and formidable navy never, I think,
spread sail upon the seas.It was a goodly yet terrible sight, to behold
them as I did, passing eastward by the straits between Dover and Calais
in a glorious day.The wind was yet so high, that I could not well go
aboard, and they were soon got out of sight.The next day, having
visited our prisoners and the Castle, and saluted the Governor, I took
horse for Margate.Here, from the North Foreland Lighthouse top (which
is a pharos, built of brick, and having on the top a cradle of iron, in
which a man attends a great sea-coal fire all the year long, when the
nights are dark, for the safeguard of sailors), we could see our fleet
as they lay at anchor.The next morning, they weighed, and sailed out of
sight to the N. E.[Sidenote: MARGATE]

19th May, 1672.Went to Margate; and, the following day, was carried to
see a gallant widow, brought up a farmeress, and I think of gigantic
race, rich, comely, and exceedingly industrious.She put me in mind of
Deborah and Abigail, her house was so plentifully stored with all manner
of country provisions, all of her own growth, and all her conveniences
so substantial, neat, and well understood; she herself so jolly and
hospitable; and her land so trim and rarely husbanded, that it struck me
with admiration at her economy.This town much consists of brewers of a certain heady ale, and they deal
much in malt, etc.For the rest, it is raggedly built, and has an ill
haven, with a small fort of little concernment, nor is the island well
disciplined; but as to the husbandry and rural part, far exceeding any
part of England for the accurate culture of their ground, in which they
exceed, even to curiosity and emulation.We passed by Rickborough, and in sight of Reculvers, and so through a
sweet garden, as it were, to Canterbury.To London and gave his Majesty an account of my journey,
and that I had put all things in readiness upon all events, and so
returned home sufficiently wearied.I received another command to repair to the seaside; so
I went to Rochester, where I found many wounded, sick, and prisoners,
newly put on shore after the engagement on the 28th, in which the Earl
of Sandwich, that incomparable person and my particular friend, and
divers more whom I loved, were lost.My Lord (who was Admiral of the
Blue) was in the "Prince," which was burnt, one of the best men-of-war
that ever spread canvas on the sea.There were lost with this brave man,
a son of Sir Charles Cotterell (Master of the Ceremonies), and a son of
Sir Charles Harbord (his Majesty's Surveyor-General), two valiant and
most accomplished youths, full of virtue and courage, who might have
saved themselves; but chose to perish with my Lord, whom they honored
and loved above their own lives.Here, I cannot but make some reflections on things past.It was not
above a day or two that going to Whitehall to take leave of his
Lordship, who had his lodgings in the Privy-Garden, shaking me by the
hand he bid me good-by, and said he thought he would see me no more, and
I saw, to my thinking, something boding in his countenance: "No," says
he, "they will not have me live.Had I lost a fleet (meaning on his
return from Bergen when he took the East India prize) I should have
fared better; but, be as it pleases God--I must do something, I know not
what, to save my reputation."Something to this effect, he had hinted to
me; thus I took my leave.I well remember that the Duke of Albemarle,
and my now Lord Clifford, had, I know not why, no great opinion of his
courage, because, in former conflicts, being an able and experienced
seaman (which neither of them were), he always brought off his Majesty's
ships without loss, though not without as many marks of true courage as
the stoutest of them; and I am a witness that, in the late war, his own
ship was pierced like a colander.But the business was, he was utterly
against this war from the beginning, and abhorred the attacking of the
Smyrna fleet; he did not favor the heady expedition of Clifford at
Bergen, nor was he so furious and confident as was the Duke of
Albemarle, who believed he could vanquish the Hollanders with one
squadron.My Lord Sandwich was prudent as well as valiant, and always
governed his affairs with success and little loss; he was for
deliberation and reason, they for action and slaughter without either;
and for this, whispered as if my Lord Sandwich was not so gallant,
because he was not so rash, and knew how fatal it was to lose a fleet,
such as was that under his conduct, and for which these very persons
would have censured him on the other side.This it was, I am confident,
grieved him, and made him enter like a lion, and fight like one too, in
the midst of the hottest service, where the stoutest of the rest seeing
him engaged, and so many ships upon him, dared not, or would not, come
to his succor, as some of them, whom I know, might have done.Thus, this
gallant person perished, to gratify the pride and envy of some I named.Deplorable was the loss of one of the best accomplished persons, not
only of this nation, but of any other.He was learned in sea affairs, in
politics, in mathematics, and in music: he had been on divers embassies,
was of a sweet and obliging temper, sober, chaste, very ingenious, a
true nobleman, an ornament to the Court and his Prince; nor has he left
any behind him who approach his many virtues.He had, I confess, served the tyrant Cromwell, when a young man, but it
was without malice, as a soldier of fortune; and he readily submitted,
and that with joy, bringing an entire fleet with him from the Sound, at
the first tidings of his Majesty's restoration.I verily believe him as
faithful a subject as any that were not his friends.I am yet heartily
grieved at this mighty loss, nor do I call it to my thoughts without
emotion.[Sidenote: ROCHESTER]

2d June, 1672.Trinity Sunday, I passed at Rochester; and, on the 5th,
there was buried in the Cathedral Monsieur Rabiniere, Rear Admiral of
the French squadron, a gallant person, who died of the wounds he
received in the fight.This ceremony lay on me, which I performed with
all the decency I could, inviting the Mayor and Aldermen to come in
their formalities.Sir Jonas Atkins was there with his guards; and the
Dean and Prebendaries: one of his countrymen pronouncing a funeral
oration at the brink of his grave, which I caused to be dug in the
choir.This is more at large described in the "Gazette" of that day;
Colonel Reymes, my colleague in commission, assisting, who was so kind
as to accompany me from London, though it was not his district; for
indeed the stress of both these wars lay more on me by far than on any
of my brethren, who had little to do in theirs.I went to see Upnore
Castle, which I found pretty well defended, but of no great moment.Next day I sailed to the fleet, now riding at the buoy of the "Nore,"
where I met his Majesty, the Duke, Lord Arlington, and all the great
men, in the "Charles," lying miserably shattered; but the miss of Lord
Sandwich redoubled the loss to me, and showed the folly of hazarding so
brave a fleet, and losing so many good men, for no provocation but that
the Hollanders exceeded us in industry, and in all things but envy.At Sheerness, I gave his Majesty and his Royal Highness an account of my
charge, and returned to Queenborough; next day dined at Major Dorel's,
Governor of Sheerness; thence, to Rochester; and the following day,
home.To London to his Majesty, to solicit for money for the
sick and wounded, which he promised me.Most of this week busied
with the sick and wounded.To Lord Sandwich's funeral, which was by water to
Westminster, in solemn pomp.I entertained the Maids of Honor (among whom there was
one I infinitely esteemed for her many and extraordinary virtues[31]) at
a comedy this afternoon, and so went home.Blagg whom Evelyn never tires of instancing and
    characterizing as a rare example of piety and virtue, in so rare a
    wit, beauty, and perfection, in a licentious court, and depraved
    age.Godolphin, and her life,
    written by Evelyn, has been edited and published by the Bishop of
    Oxford.]I was at the betrothal of Lord Arlington's only
daughter (a sweet child if ever there was any[32]) to the Duke of
Grafton, the King's natural son by the Duchess of Cleveland; the
Archbishop of Canterbury officiating, the King and the grandees being
present.I had a favor given me by my Lady; but took no great joy at the
thing for many reasons.[Footnote 32: She was then only fifteen years old.]Sir James Hayes, Secretary to Prince Rupert, dined
with me; after dinner I was sent to Gravesend to dispose of no fewer
than 800 sick men.That night I got to the fleet at the buoy of the
"Nore," where I spoke with the King and the Duke; and, after dinner next
day, returned to Gravesend.I spent this week in soliciting for moneys, and in
reading to my Lord Clifford my papers relating to the first Holland war.Now, our Council of Plantations met at Lord Shaftesbury's (Chancellor of
the Exchequer) to read and reform the draft of our new Patent, joining
the Council of Trade to our political capacities.After this, I returned
home, in order to another excursion to the seaside, to get as many as
possible of the men who were recovered on board the fleet.I lay at Gravesend, thence to Rochester, returning
on the 11th.Duport, Greek Professor of Cambridge, preached
before the King, on 1 Timothy vi.No great preacher, but a very
worthy and learned man.I dined at Lord John Berkeley's, newly arrived
out of Ireland, where he had been Deputy; it was in his new house, or
rather palace; for I am assured it stood him in near L30,000.It was
very well built, and has many noble rooms, but they are not very
convenient, consisting but of one _Corps de Logis_; they are all rooms
of state, without closets.The staircase is of cedar, the furniture is
princely: the kitchen and stables are ill placed, and the corridor
worse, having no report to the wings they join to.For the rest, the
fore-court is noble, so are the stables; and, above all, the gardens,
which are incomparable by reason of the inequality of the ground, and a
pretty piscina.The holly hedges on the terrace I advised the planting
of.The porticos are in imitation of a house described by Palladio; but
it happens to be the worst in his book, though my good friend, Mr.Hugh
May, his Lordship's architect, effected it.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th September, 1672.I carried with me to dinner my Lord H. Howard (now
to be made Earl of Norwich and Earl Marshal of England) to Sir Robert
Clayton's, now Sheriff of London, at his new house, where we had a great
feast; it is built indeed for a great magistrate, at excessive cost.The
cedar dining room is painted with the history of the Giants' War,
incomparably done by Mr.Streeter, but the figures are too near the eye.Thistlethwaite preached at Whitehall on Rev.2,--a young, but good preacher.Blandford, Bishop of Worcester, and Dean of the Chapel, officiating.Dined at my Lord Clifford's, with Lord Mulgrave, Sir Gilbert Talbot, and
Sir Robert Holmes.I took leave of my Lady Sunderland, who was going to
Paris to my Lord, now ambassador there.She made me stay to dinner at
Leicester House, and afterward sent for Richardson, the famous
fire-eater.He devoured brimstone on glowing coals before us, chewing
and swallowing them; he melted a beer-glass and ate it quite up; then,
taking a live coal on his tongue, he put on it a raw oyster, the coal
was blown on with bellows till it flamed and sparkled in his mouth, and
so remained till the oyster gaped and was quite boiled.Then, he melted
pitch and wax with sulphur, which he drank down as it flamed; I saw it
flaming in his mouth a good while; he also took up a thick piece of
iron, such as laundresses use to put in their smoothing boxes, when it
was fiery hot, held it between his teeth, then in his hand, and threw it
about like a stone; but this, I observed, he cared not to hold very
long; then he stood on a small pot, and, bending his body, took a
glowing iron with his mouth from between his feet, without touching the
pot, or ground, with his hands; with divers other prodigious feats.After sermon (being summoned before), I went to my
Lord Keeper's, Sir Orlando Bridgeman, at Essex House, where our new
patent was opened and read, constituting us that were of the Council of
Plantations, to be now of the Council of Trade also, both united.After
the patent was read, we all took our oaths, and departed.Met in Council, the Earl of Shaftesbury, now our
president, swearing our secretary and his clerks, which was Mr.Locke,
an excellent learned gentleman, and student of Christ Church, Mr.We dispatched a letter to Sir Thomas Linch, Governor of
Jamaica, giving him notice of a design of the Dutch on that island.I went to hear that famous preacher, Dr.Giles's, on Psalm xxxix.This divine had been twice at
Jerusalem, and was not only a very pious and holy man, but excellent in
the pulpit for the moving affections.At Council, we debated the business of the consulate
of Leghorn.I was of the committee with Sir Humphry Winch, the chairman,
to examine the laws of his Majesty's several plantations and colonies in
the West Indies, etc.Many merchants were summoned about the consulate of
Venice; which caused great disputes; the most considerable thought it
useless.This being the Queen-Consort's birthday, there was an
extraordinary appearance of gallantry, and a ball danced at Court.[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st January, 1672-73.After public prayers in the chapel at Whitehall,
when I gave God solemn thanks for all his mercies to me the year past,
and my humble supplications to him for his blessing the year now
entering, I returned home, having my poor deceased servant (Adams) to
bury, who died of pleurisy.My son now published his version of "_Raptinus
Hortorum_."Visited Don Francisco de Melos, the Portugal
Ambassador, who showed me his curious collection of books and pictures.He was a person of good parts, and a virtuous man.To Council about reforming an abuse of the dyers
with _saundus_, and other false drugs; examined divers of that trade.The Bishop of Chichester preached before the King
on Coloss.14, 15, admirably well, as he can do nothing but what is
well.Holden, preached in Whitehall
chapel, on Psalm iv.This gentleman is a very excellent and
universal scholar, a good and wise man; but he had not the popular way
of preaching, nor is in any measure fit for our plain and vulgar
auditory, as his predecessor was.There was, however, no comparison
between their parts for profound learning.But time and experience may
form him to a more practical way than that he is in of University
lectures and erudition; which is now universally left off for what is
much more profitable.I heard the speech made to the Lords in their House by
Sir Samuel Tuke, in behalf of the <DW7>s, to take off the penal laws;
and then dined with Colonel Norwood.Pearson, Bishop of Chester, preached on Hebrews
ix.14; a most incomparable sermon from one of the most learned divines
of our nation.I dined at my Lord Arlington's with the Duke and Duchess
of Monmouth; she is one of the wisest and craftiest of her sex, and has
much wit.Here was also the learned Isaac Vossius.During Lent there is constantly the most excellent preaching by the most
eminent bishops and divines of the nation.I was sworn a younger brother of the Trinity House,
with my most worthy and long-acquainted noble friend, Lord Ossory
(eldest son to the Duke of Ormond), Sir Richard Browne, my
father-in-law, being now Master of that Society; after which there was a
great collation.I carried my son to the Bishop of Chichester, that
learned and pious man, Dr.Peter Gunning, to be instructed by him before
he received the Holy Sacrament, when he gave him most excellent advice,
which I pray God may influence and remain with him as long as he lives;
and O that I had been so blessed and instructed, when first I was
admitted to that sacred ordinance!Myself and son received the blessed
Communion, it being his first time, and with that whole week's more
extraordinary preparation.I beseech God to make him a sincere and good
Christian, while I endeavor to instill into him the fear and love of
God, and discharge the duty of a father.At the sermon _coram Rege_, preached by Dr.Sparrow, Bishop of Exeter,
to a most crowded auditory; I stayed to see whether, according to
custom, the Duke of York received the Communion with the King; but he
did not, to the amazement of everybody.This being the second year he
had forborne, and put it off, and within a day of the Parliament
sitting, who had lately made so severe an Act against the increase of
Popery, gave exceeding grief and scandal to the whole nation, that the
heir of it, and the son of a martyr for the Protestant religion, should
apostatize.What the consequence of this will be, God only knows, and
wise men dread.I dined with the plenipotentiaries designed for the
treaty of Nimeguen.I carried Lady Tuke to thank the Countess of Arlington
for speaking to his Majesty in her behalf, for being one of the Queen
Consort's women.She carried us up into her new dressing room at Goring
House, where was a bed, two glasses, silver jars, and vases, cabinets,
and other so rich furniture as I had seldom seen; to this excess of
superfluity were we now arrived and that not only at Court, but almost
universally, even to wantonness and profusion.Compton, brother to the Earl of Northampton, preached on 1 Corinth.11-16, showing the Church's power in ordaining things indifferent;
this worthy person's talent is not preaching, but he is likely to make a
grave and serious good man.I saw her Majesty's rich toilet in her dressing room, being all of massy
gold, presented to her by the King, valued at L4,000.Martin's the Holy
Sacrament following, which I partook of, upon obligation of the late Act
of Parliament, enjoining everybody in office, civil or military, under
penalty of L500, to receive it within one month before two authentic
witnesses; being engrossed on parchment, to be afterward produced in the
Court of Chancery, or some other Court of Record; which I did at the
Chancery bar, as being one of the Council of Plantations and Trade;
taking then also the oath of allegiance and supremacy, signing the
clause in the said Act against Transubstantiation.My son was made a younger brother of the Trinity House.The new master was Sir J. Smith, one of the Commissioners of the Navy, a
stout seaman, who had interposed and saved the Duke from perishing by a
fire ship in the late war.I carried one Withers, an ingenious shipwright, to the
King to show him some new method of building.I saw the Italian comedy at the Court, this afternoon.Came to visit and dine with me my Lord Viscount
Cornbury and his Lady; Lady Frances Hyde, sister to the Duchess of York;
and Mrs.We went, after dinner, to see
the formal and formidable camp on Blackheath, raised to invade Holland;
or, as others suspected for another design.Thence, to the Italian
glass-house at Greenwich, where glass was blown of finer metal than that
of Murano, at Venice.Came to visit us, with other ladies of rank, Mrs.Sedley,[33] daughter to Sir Charles, who was none of the most virtuous,
but a wit.[Footnote 33: The Duke of York's mistress, afterward created by him
    Countess of Dorchester.]Congratulated the new Lord Treasurer, Sir Thomas
Osborne, a gentleman with whom I had been intimately acquainted at
Paris, and who was every day at my father-in-law's house and table
there; on which account I was too confident of succeeding in his favor,
as I had done in his predecessor's; but such a friend shall I never
find, and I neglected my time, far from believing that my Lord Clifford
would have so rashly laid down his staff, as he did, to the amazement of
all the world, when it came to the test of his receiving the Communion,
which I am confident he forbore more from some promise he had entered
into to gratify the Duke, than from any prejudice to the Protestant
religion, though I found him wavering a pretty while.[Sidenote: LONDON]

23d June, 1673.To London, to accompany our Council who went in a body
to congratulate the new Lord Treasurer, no friend to it because promoted
by my Lord Arlington, whom he hated.Came visitors from Court to dine with me and see the
army still remaining encamped on Blackheath.[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th July, 1673.This evening I went to the funeral of my dear and
excellent friend, that good man and accomplished gentleman, Sir Robert
Murray, Secretary of Scotland.He was buried by order of his Majesty in
Westminster Abbey.I went to Tunbridge Wells, to visit my Lord Clifford,
late Lord Treasurer, who was there to divert his mind more than his
body; it was believed that he had so engaged himself to the Duke, that
rather than take the Test, without which he was not capable of holding
any office, he would resign that great and honorable station.This, I am
confident, grieved him to the heart, and at last broke it; for, though
he carried with him music, and people to divert him, and, when I came to
see him, lodged me in his own apartment, and would not let me go from
him, I found he was struggling in his mind; and being of a rough and
ambitious nature, he could not long brook the necessity he had brought
on himself, of submission to this conjuncture.Besides, he saw the Dutch
war, which was made much by his advice, as well as the shutting up of
the Exchequer, very unprosperous.These things his high spirit could not
support.Having stayed here two or three days, I obtained leave of my
Lord to return.In my way, I saw my Lord of Dorset's house at Knowle, near Sevenoaks, a
great old-fashioned house.To Council, where the business of transporting wool was
brought before us.I went to see the pictures of all the judges and
eminent men of the Long Robe, newly painted by Mr.Wright, and set up in
Guildhall, costing the city L1,000.Most of them are very like the
persons they represent, though I never took Wright to be any
considerable artist.I rode to Durdans, where I dined at my Lord
Berkeley's of Berkeley Castle, my old and noble friend, it being his
wedding anniversary, where I found the Duchess of Albemarle, and other
company, and returned home on that evening late.Came to visit me my Lord Chancellor, the Earl of
Shaftesbury.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th August, 1673.My Lord Clifford, being about this time returned
from Tunbridge, and preparing for Devonshire, I went to take my leave of
him at Wallingford House; he was packing up pictures, most of which were
of hunting wild beasts and vast pieces of bull-baiting, bear-baiting,
etc.I found him in his study, and restored to him several papers of
state, and others of importance, which he had furnished me with, on
engaging me to write the "History of the Holland War," with other
private letters of his acknowledgments to my Lord Arlington, who from a
private gentleman of a very noble family, but inconsiderable fortune,
had advanced him from almost nothing.The first thing was his being in
Parliament, then knighted, then made one of the Commissioners of sick
and wounded, on which occasion we sat long together; then, on the death
of Hugh Pollard, he was made Comptroller of the Household and Privy
Councillor, yet still my brother Commissioner; after the death of Lord
Fitz-Harding, Treasurer of the Household, he, by letters to Lord
Arlington, which that Lord showed me, begged of his Lordship to obtain
it for him as the very height of his ambition.These were written with
such submissions and professions of his patronage, as I had never seen
any more acknowledging.The Earl of Southampton then dying, he was made
one of the Commissioners of the Treasury.His Majesty inclining to put
it into one hand, my Lord Clifford, under pretense of making all his
interest for his patron, my Lord Arlington, cut the grass under his
feet, and procured it for himself, assuring the King that Lord Arlington
did not desire it.Indeed, my Lord Arlington protested to me that his
confidence in Lord Clifford made him so remiss and his affection to him
was so particular, that he was absolutely minded to devolve it on Lord
Clifford, all the world knowing how he himself affected ease and quiet,
now growing into years, yet little thinking of this go-by.This was the
great ingratitude Lord Clifford showed, keeping my Lord Arlington in
ignorance, continually assuring him he was pursuing his interest, which
was the Duke's into whose great favor Lord Clifford was now gotten; but
which certainly cost him the loss of all, namely, his going so
irrevocably far in his interest.For the rest, my Lord Clifford was a valiant, incorrupt gentleman,
ambitious, not covetous; generous, passionate, a most constant, sincere
friend, to me in particular, so as when he laid down his office, I was
at the end of all my hopes and endeavors.These were not for high
matters, but to obtain what his Majesty was really indebted to my
father-in-law, which was the utmost of my ambition, and which I had
undoubtedly obtained, if this friend had stood.Sir Thomas Osborn, who
succeeded him, though much more obliged to my father-in-law and his
family, and my long and old acquaintance, being of a more haughty and
far less obliging nature, I could hope for little; a man of excellent
natural parts; but nothing of generous or grateful.Taking leave of my Lord Clifford, he wrung me by the hand, and, looking
earnestly on me, bid me God-b'ye, adding, "Mr.Evelyn, I shall never see
thee more."said I, "my Lord, what's the meaning of this?I hope I
shall see you often, and as great a person again."Evelyn, do
not expect it, I will never see this place, this city, or Court again,"
or words of this sound.In this manner, not without almost mutual tears,
I parted from him; nor was it long after, but the news was that he was
dead, and I have heard from some who I believe knew, he made himself
away, after an extraordinary melancholy.This is not confidently
affirmed, but a servant who lived in the house, and afterward with Sir
Robert Clayton, Lord Mayor, did, as well as others, report it, and when
I hinted some such thing to Mr.Prideaux, one of his trustees, he was
not willing to enter into that discourse.It was reported with these particulars, that, causing his servant to
leave him unusually one morning, locking himself in, he strangled
himself with his cravat upon the bed-tester; his servant, not liking the
manner of dismissing him, and looking through the keyhole (as I
remember), and seeing his master hanging, broke in before he was quite
dead, and taking him down, vomiting a great deal of blood, he was heard
to utter these words: "Well; let men say what they will, there is a God,
a just God above"; after which he spoke no more.This, if true, is
dismal.Really, he was the chief occasion of the Dutch war, and of all
that blood which was lost at Bergen in attacking the Smyrna fleet, and
that whole quarrel.This leads me to call to mind what my Lord Chancellor Shaftesbury
affirmed, not to me only, but to all my brethren the Council of Foreign
Plantations, when not long after, this accident being mentioned as we
were one day sitting in Council, his Lordship told us this remarkable
passage: that, being one day discoursing with him when he was only Sir
Thomas Clifford, speaking of men's advancement to great charges in the
nation, "Well," says he, "my Lord, I shall be one of the greatest men in
England.Don't impute what I say either to fancy, or vanity; I am
certain that I shall be a mighty man; but it will not last long; I shall
not hold it, but die a bloody death.""What," says my Lord, "your
horoscope tells you so?""No matter for that, it will be as I tell you.""Well," says my Lord Chancellor Shaftesbury, "if I were of that opinion,
I either would not be a great man, but decline preferment, or prevent my
danger."This my Lord affirmed in my hearing before several gentlemen and
noblemen sitting in council at Whitehall.And I the rather am confident
of it, remembering what Sir Edward Walker (Garter King-at-Arms) had
likewise affirmed to me a long time before, even when he was first made
a Lord; that carrying his pedigree to Lord Clifford on his being created
a peer, and, finding him busy, he bade him go into his study and divert
himself there till he was at leisure to discourse with him about some
things relating to his family; there lay, said Sir Edward, on his table,
his horoscope and nativity calculated, with some writing under it, where
he read that he should be advanced to the highest degree in the state
that could be conferred upon him, but that he should not long enjoy it,
but should die, or expressions to that sense; and I think, (but cannot
confidently say) a bloody death.This Sir Edward affirmed both to me and
Sir Richard Browne; nor could I forbear to note this extraordinary
passage in these memoirs.Creighton, son to the late eloquent Bishop of
Bath and Wells, preached to the Household on Isaiah, lvii.I procured L4,000 of the Lords of the Treasury,
and rectified divers matters about the sick and wounded.Bernard
Grenville, at Abs Court in Surrey; an old house in a pretty park.I went to see Paradise, a room in Hatton Garden
furnished with a representation of all sorts of animals handsomely
painted on boards or cloth, and so cut out and made to stand, move, fly,
crawl, roar, and make their several cries.The man who showed it, made
us laugh heartily at his formal poetry.To Council, about sending succors to recover New
York: and then we read the commission and instructions to Sir Jonathan
Atkins, the new Governor of Barbadoes.This night the youths of the city burned the Pope in
effigy, after they had made procession with it in great triumph, they
being displeased at the Duke for altering his religion and marrying an
Italian lady.Andrew's day I first saw the new Duchess of
York, and the Duchess of Modena, her mother.[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st December, 1673.To Gresham College, whither the city had invited the
Royal Society by many of their chief aldermen and magistrates, who gave
us a collation, to welcome us to our first place of assembly, from
whence we had been driven to give place to the City, on their making it
their Exchange on the dreadful conflagration, till their new Exchange
was finished, which it now was.The Society having till now been
entertained and having met at Arundel House.I dined with some friends, and visited the sick;
thence, to an almshouse, where was prayers and relief, some very ill and
miserable.It was one of the best days I ever spent in my life.There was at dinner my Lord Lockhart, designed
Ambassador for France, a gallant and sober person.I saw again the Italian Duchess and her brother, the
Prince Reynaldo.I had some discourse with certain strangers, not
unlearned, who had been born not far from Old Nineveh; they assured me
of the ruins being still extant, and vast and wonderful were the
buildings, vaults, pillars, and magnificent fragments;[34] but they
could say little of the Tower of Babel that satisfied me.But the
description of the amenity and fragrancy of the country for health and
cheerfulness, delighted me; so sensibly they spoke of the excellent air
and climate in respect of our cloudy and splenetic country.[Footnote 34: The remarkable discoveries of Mr.Layard give now a
    curious interest to this notice by Evelyn.]Visited the prisoners at Ludgate, taking orders
about the releasing of some.I gave Almighty God thanks for his infinite
goodness to me the year past, and begged his mercy and protection the
year following; afterward, invited my neighbors to spend the day with
me.I saw an Italian opera in music, the first that
had been in England of this kind.Sent for by his Majesty to write something against
the Hollanders about the duty of the Flag and Fishery.I dined at Knightsbridge, with the Bishops of
Salisbury, Chester, and Lincoln, my old friends.Demalhoy,
Roger L'Estrange, and several of my friends, came to dine with me on the
happy occasion.Dryden, the famous poet and now laureate, came to
give me a visit.It was the anniversary of my marriage, and the first
day I went into my new little cell and cabinet, which I built below
toward the south court, at the east end of the parlor.Jacombe's son's share in
the mill and land at Deptford, which I bought of the Beechers.I went to Windsor with my wife and son to see my
daughter Mary, who was there with my Lady Tuke and to do my duty to his
Majesty.Next day, to a great entertainment at Sir Robert Holmes's at
Cranbourne Lodge, in the Forest; there were his Majesty, the Queen,
Duke, Duchess, and all the Court.I returned in the evening with Sir
Joseph Williamson, now declared Secretary of State.He was son of a poor
clergyman somewhere in Cumberland, brought up at Queen's College,
Oxford, of which he came to be a fellow; then traveled with... and
returning when the King was restored, was received as a clerk under Mr.Sir Henry Bennett (now Lord Arlington) succeeding,
Williamson is transferred to him, who loving his ease more than business
(though sufficiently able had he applied himself to it) remitted all to
his man Williamson; and, in a short time, let him so into the secret of
affairs, that (as his Lordship himself told me) there was a kind of
necessity to advance him; and so, by his subtlety, dexterity, and
insinuation, he got now to be principal Secretary; absolutely Lord
Arlington's creature, and ungrateful enough.It has been the fate of
this obliging favorite to advance those who soon forgot their original.Sir Joseph was a musician, could play at _Jeu de Goblets_, exceedingly
formal, a severe master to his servants, but so inward with my Lord
O'Brien, that after a few months of that gentleman's death, he married
his widow,[35] who, being sister and heir of the Duke of Richmond,
brought him a noble fortune.It was thought they lived not so kindly
after marriage as they did before.She was much censured for marrying so
meanly, being herself allied to the Royal family.[Footnote 35: Lady Catherine Stuart, sister and heir to Charles
    Stuart, Duke of Richmond and Lennox, the husband of Mrs.Frances
    Stuart, one of the most admired beauties of the Court, with whom
    Charles II.was so deeply in love that he never forgave the Duke for
    marrying her, having already, it is thought, formed some similar
    intention himself.He took the first opportunity of sending the Duke
    into an honorable exile, as Ambassador to Denmark, where he shortly
    after died, leaving no issue by the Duchess.][Sidenote: GROOMBRIDGE]

6th August, 1674.I went to Groombridge, to see my old friend, Mr.Packer; the house built within a moat, in a woody valley.The old house
had been the place of confinement of the Duke of Orleans, taken by one
Waller (whose house it then was) at the battle of Agincourt, now
demolished, and a new one built in its place, though a far better
situation had been on the south of the wood, on a graceful ascent.At
some small distance, is a large chapel, not long since built by Mr.Packer's father, on a vow he made to do it on the return of King Charles
I. out of Spain, 1625, and dedicated to St.Charles, but what saint
there was then of that name I am to seek, for, being a Protestant, I
conceive it was not Borromeo.I went to see my farm at Ripe, near Lewes.His Majesty told me how exceedingly the Dutch were
displeased at my treatise of the "History of Commerce;" that the Holland
Ambassador had complained to him of what I had touched of the Flags and
Fishery, etc., and desired the book might be called in; while on the
other side, he assured me he was exceedingly pleased with what I had
done, and gave me many thanks.However, it being just upon conclusion of
the treaty of Breda (indeed it was designed to have been published some
months before and when we were at defiance), his Majesty told me he must
recall it formally; but gave order that what copies should be publicly
seized to pacify the Ambassador, should immediately be restored to the
printer, and that neither he nor the vender should be molested.The
truth is, that which touched the Hollander was much less than what the
King himself furnished me with, and obliged me to publish, having caused
it to be read to him before it went to press; but the error was, it
should have been published before the peace was proclaimed.The noise of
this book's suppression made it presently to be bought up, and turned
much to the stationer's advantage.It was no other than the preface
prepared to be prefixed to my "History of the Whole War;" which I now
pursued no further.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st August, 1674.In one of the meadows at the foot of the long
Terrace below the Castle [Windsor], works were thrown up to show the
King a representation of the city of Maestricht, newly taken by the
French.Bastians, bulwarks, ramparts, palisadoes, graffs, horn-works,
counter-scarps, etc., were constructed.It was attacked by the Duke of
Monmouth (newly come from the real siege) and the Duke of York, with a
little army, to show their skill in tactics.On Saturday night they made
their approaches, opened trenches, raised batteries, took the
counter-scarp and ravelin, after a stout defense; great guns fired on
both sides, grenadoes shot, mines sprung, parties sent out, attempts of
raising the siege, prisoners taken, parleys; and, in short, all the
circumstances of a formal siege, to appearance, and, what is most
strange all without disorder, or ill accident, to the great satisfaction
of a thousand spectators.The
siege being over, I went with Mr.Pepys back to London, where we arrived
about three in the morning.To Council, about fetching away the English left
at Surinam, etc., since our reconciliation with Holland.I went to see the great loss that Lord Arlington
had sustained by fire at Goring House, this night consumed to the
ground, with exceeding loss of hangings, plate, rare pictures, and
cabinets; hardly anything was saved of the best and most princely
furniture that any subject had in England.My lord and lady were both
absent at the Bath.The Lord Chief Baron Turner, and Sergeant Wild,
Recorder of London, came to visit me.At Lord Berkeley's, I discoursed with Sir Thomas
Modiford, late Governor of Jamaica, and with Colonel Morgan, who
undertook that gallant exploit from Nombre de Dios to Panama, on the
Continent of America; he told me 10,000 men would easily conquer all the
Spanish Indies, they were so secure.They took great booty, and much
greater had been taken, had they not been betrayed and so discovered
before their approach, by which the Spaniards had time to carry their
vast treasure on board ships that put off to sea in sight of our men,
who had no boats to follow.They set fire to Panama, and ravaged the
country sixty miles about.The Spaniards were so supine and unexercised,
that they were afraid to fire a great gun.My birthday, 54th year of my life.It was also preparation day for the Holy Sacrament, in which I
participated the next day, imploring God's protection for the year
following, and confirming my resolutions of a more holy life, even upon
the Holy Book.The anniversary of my baptism: I first heard that
famous and excellent preacher, Dr.Burnet, author of the "History of the
Reformation" on Colossians iii.10, with such flow of eloquence and
fullness of matter, as showed him to be a person oL extraordinary parts.Being her Majesty's birthday, the Court was exceeding splendid in
clothes and jewels, to the height of excess.To Council, on the business of Surinam, where the
Dutch had detained some English in prison, ever since the first war,
1665.I heard that stupendous violin, Signor Nicholao
(with other rare musicians), whom I never heard mortal man exceed on
that instrument.He had a stroke so sweet, and made it speak like the
voice of a man, and, when he pleased, like a concert of several
instruments.He did wonders upon a note, and was an excellent composer.Here was also that rare lutanist, Dr.Wallgrave; but nothing approached
the violin in Nicholao's hand.He played such ravishing things as
astonished us all.Slingsby's, master of the mint, my worthy
friend, a great lover of music.Heard Signor Francisco on the
harpsichord, esteemed one of the most excellent masters in Europe on
that instrument; then, came Nicholao with his violin, and struck all
mute, but Mrs.Knight, who sung incomparably, and doubtless has the
greatest reach of any English woman; she had been lately roaming in
Italy, and was much improved in that quality.Saw a comedy at night, at Court, acted by the
ladies only, among them Lady Mary and Ann, his Royal Highness' two
daughters, and my dear friend Mrs.Blagg, who, having the principal
part, performed it to admiration.Was at the repetition of the "Pastoral," on which
occasion Mrs.Blagg had about her near L20,000 worth of jewels, of which
she lost one worth about L80, borrowed of the Countess of Suffolk.The
press was so great, that it is a wonder she lost no more.Streeter, that excellent painter
of perspective and landscape, to comfort and encourage him to be cut for
the stone, with which that honest man was exceedingly afflicted.[Sidenote: LONDON]

22d March, 1675.Supped at Sir William Petty's, with the Bishop of
Salisbury, and divers honorable persons.We had a noble entertainment in
a house gloriously furnished; the master and mistress of it were
extraordinary persons.Sir William was the son of a mean man somewhere
in Sussex, and sent from school to Oxford, where he studied Philosophy,
but was most eminent in Mathematics and Mechanics; proceeded Doctor of
Physic, and was grown famous, as for his learning so for his recovering
a poor wench that had been hanged for felony; and her body having been
begged (as the custom is) for the anatomy lecture, he bled her, put her
to bed to a warm woman, and, with spirits and other means, restored her
to life.The young scholars joined and made a little portion, and
married her to a man who had several children by her, she living fifteen
years after, as I have been assured.Sir William came from Oxford to be
tutor to a neighbor of mine; thence, when the rebels were dividing their
conquests in Ireland, he was employed by them to measure and set out the
land, which he did on an easy contract, so much per acre.This he
effected so exactly, that it not only furnished him with a great sum of
money; but enabled him to purchase an estate worth L4,000 a year.He
afterward married the daughter of Sir Hardress Waller; she was an
extraordinary wit as well as beauty, and a prudent woman.Sir William, among other inventions, was author of the double-bottomed
ship, which perished, and he was censured for rashness, being lost in
the Bay of Biscay in a storm, when, I think, fifteen other vessels
miscarried.This vessel was flat-bottomed, of exceeding use to put into
shallow ports, and ride over small depths of water.It consisted of two
distinct keels cramped together with huge timbers, etc., so as that a
violent stream ran between; it bore a monstrous broad sail, and he still
persists that it is practicable, and of exceeding use; and he has often
told me he would adventure himself in such another, could he procure
sailors, and his Majesty's permission to make a second Experiment; which
name the King gave the vessel at the launching.The Map of Ireland made by Sir William Petty is believed to be the most
exact that ever yet was made of any country.He did promise to publish
it; and I am told it has cost him near L1,000 to have it engraved at
Amsterdam.There is not a better Latin poet living, when he gives
himself that diversion; nor is his excellence less in Council and
prudent matters of state; but he is so exceedingly nice in sifting and
examining all possible contingencies, that he adventures at nothing
which is not demonstration.There was not in the whole world his equal
for a superintendent of manufacture and improvement of trade, or to
govern a plantation.If I were a Prince, I should make him my second
Counsellor, at least.He is, besides,
courageous; on which account, I cannot but note a true story of him,
that when Sir Aleyn Brodrick sent him a challenge upon a difference
between them in Ireland, Sir William, though exceedingly purblind,
accepted the challenge, and it being his part to propound the weapon,
desired his antagonist to meet him with a hatchet, or axe, in a dark
cellar; which the other, of course, refused.Sir William was, with all this, facetious and of easy conversation,
friendly and courteous, and had such a faculty of imitating others, that
he would take a text and preach, now like a grave orthodox divine, then
falling into the Presbyterian way, then to the fanatical, the Quaker,
the monk and friar, the Popish priest, with such admirable action, and
alteration of voice and tone, as it was not possible to abstain from
wonder, and one would swear to hear several persons, or forbear to think
he was not in good earnest an enthusiast and almost beside himself;
then, he would fall out of it into a serious discourse; but it was very
rarely he would be prevailed on to oblige the company with this faculty,
and that only among most intimate friends.My Lord Duke of Ormond once
obtained it of him, and was almost ravished with admiration; but by and
by, he fell upon a serious reprimand of the faults and miscarriages of
some Princes and Governors, which, though he named none, did so sensibly
touch the Duke, who was then Lieutenant of Ireland, that he began to be
very uneasy, and wished the spirit laid which he had raised, for he was
neither able to endure such truths, nor could he but be delighted.At
last, he melted his discourse to a ridiculous subject, and came down
from the joint stool on which he had stood; but my lord would not have
him preach any more.He never could get favor at Court, because he
outwitted all the projectors that came near him.Having never known such
another genius, I cannot but mention these particulars, among a
multitude of others which I could produce.When I, who knew him in mean
circumstances, have been in his splendid palace, he would himself be in
admiration how he arrived at it; nor was it his value or inclination for
splendid furniture and the curiosities of the age, but his elegant lady
could endure nothing mean, or that was not magnificent.He was very
negligent himself, and rather so of his person, and of a philosophic
temper.would he say, "I can lie in straw with
as much satisfaction."He is author of the ingenious deductions from the bills of mortality,
which go under the name of Mr.Graunt; also of that useful discourse of
the manufacture of wool, and several others in the register of the Royal
Society.He was also author of that paraphrase on the 104th Psalm in
Latin verse, which goes about in MS., and is inimitable.In a word,
there is nothing impenetrable to him.Brideoak was elected Bishop of Chichester, on the
translation of Dr.3, the necessity
of those who are baptized to die to sin; a very excellent discourse from
an excellent preacher.Barrow, that excellent, pious, and most learned
man, divine, mathematician, poet, traveler, and most humble person,
preached at Whitehall to the household, on Luke xx.27, of love and
charity to our neighbors.I read my first discourse, "Of Earth and Vegetation,"
before the Royal Society as a lecture in course, after Sir Robert
Southwell had read his, the week before, "On Water."I was commanded by
our President and the suffrage of the Society, to print it.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th May, 1675.Blagg, married at the
Temple Church to my friend, Mr.Sidney Godolphin, Groom of the
Bedchamber to his Majesty.Bathurst, a Spanish merchant, my
neighbor.I went with Lord Ossory to Deptford, where we chose him
Master of the Trinity Company.I was at a conference of the Lords and Commons in the
Painted Chamber, on a difference about imprisoning some of their
members; and on the 3d, at another conference, when the Lords accused
the Commons for their transcendent misbehavior, breach of privilege,
Magna Charta, subversion of government, and other high, provoking, and
diminishing expressions, showing what duties and subjection they owed to
the Lords in Parliament, by record of Henry IV.This was likely to
create a notable disturbance.This afternoon came Monsieur Querouaille and his lady,
parents to the famous beauty and... favorite at Court, to see Sir R.
Browne, with whom they were intimately acquainted in Bretagne, at the
time Sir Richard was sent to Brest to supervise his Majesty's sea
affairs, during the latter part of the King's banishment.This
gentleman's house was not a mile from Brest; Sir Richard made an
acquaintance there, and, being used very civilly, was obliged to return
it here, which we did.He seemed a soldierly person and a good fellow,
as the Bretons generally are; his lady had been very handsome, and
seemed a shrewd understanding woman.Conversing with him in our garden,
I found several words of the Breton language the same with our Welsh.His daughter was now made Duchess of Portsmouth, and in the height of
favor; but he never made any use of it.At Ely House, I went to the consecration of my worthy
friend, the learned Dr.Barlow, Warden of Queen's College, Oxford, now
made Bishop of Lincoln.After it succeeded a magnificent feast, where
were the Duke of Ormond, Earl of Lauderdale, the Lord Treasurer, Lord
Keeper, etc.Howard and her two daughters toward
Northampton Assizes, about a trial at law, in which I was concerned for
them as a trustee.We lay this night at Henley-on-the Thames, at our
attorney, Mr.Stephens's, who entertained us very handsomely.Next day,
dining at Shotover, at Sir Timothy Tyrill's, a sweet place, we lay at
Oxford, where it was the time of the Act.Robert Spencer, uncle to
the Earl of Sunderland, and my old acquaintance in France, entertained
us at his apartment in Christ Church with exceeding generosity.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th July, 1675.Bathurst (who had formerly
taken particular care of my son), President of Trinity College invited
me to dinner, and did me great honor all the time of my stay.The next
day, he invited me and all my company, though strangers to him, to a
very noble feast.I was at all the academic exercises.--Sunday, at St.Mary's, preached a Fellow of Brasen-nose, not a little magnifying the
dignity of Churchmen.We heard the speeches, and saw the ceremony of creating
doctors in Divinity, Law and Physic.I had, early in the morning, heard
Dr.Morison, Botanic Professor, read on divers plants in the Physic
Garden; and saw that rare collection of natural curiosities of Dr.Plot's, of Magdalen Hall, author of "The Natural History of
Oxfordshire," all of them collected in that shire, and indeed
extraordinary, that in one county there should be found such variety of
plants, shells, stones, minerals, marcasites, fowls, insects, models of
works, crystals, agates, and marbles.He was now intending to visit
Staffordshire, and, as he had of Oxfordshire, to give us the natural,
topical, political, and mechanical history.Pity it is that more of this
industrious man's genius were not employed so to describe every county
of England; it would be one of the most useful and illustrious works
that was ever produced in any age or nation.I visited also the Bodleian Library and my old friend, the learned
Obadiah Walker, head of University College, which he had now almost
rebuilt, or repaired.We then proceeded to Northampton, where we arrived
the next day.In this journey, went part of the way Mr.James Graham (since Privy
Purse to the Duke), a young gentleman exceedingly in love with Mrs.Dorothy Howard, one of the maids of honor in our company.I could not
but pity them both, the mother not much favoring it.This lady was not
only a great beauty, but a most virtuous and excellent creature, and
worthy to have been wife to the best of men.My advice was required, and
I spoke to the advantage of the young gentleman, more out of pity than
that she deserved no better match; for, though he was a gentleman of
good family, yet there was great inequality.I went to see my Lord Sunderland's Seat at Althorpe,
four miles from the ragged town of Northampton (since burned, and well
rebuilt).It is placed in a pretty open bottom, very finely watered and
flanked with stately woods and groves in a park, with a canal, but the
water is not running, which is a defect.The house, a kind of modern
building, of freestone, within most nobly furnished; the apartments very
commodious, a gallery and noble hall; but the kitchen being in the body
of the house, and chapel too small, were defects.There is an old yet
honorable gatehouse standing awry, and out-housing mean, but designed to
be taken away.It was moated round, after the old manner, but it is now
dry, and turfed with a beautiful carpet.Above all, are admirable and
magnificent the several ample gardens furnished with the choicest fruit,
and exquisitely kept.Great plenty of oranges, and other curiosities.The park full of fowl, especially herons, and from it a prospect to
Holmby House, which being demolished in the late civil wars, shows like
a Roman ruin shaded by the trees about it, a stately, solemn, and
pleasing view.Our cause was pleaded in behalf of the mother, Mrs.Howard and her daughters, before Baron Thurland, who had formerly been
steward of Courts for me; we carried our cause, as there was reason, for
here was an impudent as well as disobedient son against his mother, by
instigation, doubtless, of his wife, one Mrs.Ogle (an ancient maid),
whom he had clandestinely married, and who brought him no fortune, he
being heir-apparent to the Earl of Berkshire.We lay at Brickhill, in
Bedfordshire, and came late the next day to our journey's end.This was a journey of adventures and knight-errantry.One of the lady's
servants being as desperately in love with Mrs.Graham was with her daughter, and she riding on horseback behind his
rival, the amorous and jealous youth having a little drink in his pate,
had here killed himself had he not been prevented; for, alighting from
his horse, and drawing his sword, he endeavored twice or thrice to fall
on it, but was interrupted by our coachman, and a stranger passing by.After this, running to his rival, and snatching his sword from his side
(for we had beaten his own out of his hand), and on the sudden pulling
down his mistress, would have run both of them through; we parted them,
not without some blood.This miserable creature poisoned himself for her
not many days after they came to London.[Sidenote: LONDON]

19th July, 1675.The Lord Treasurer's Chaplain preached at Wallingford
House.Sprat, prebend of Westminster, and Chaplain to the
Duke of Buckingham, preached on the 3d Epistle of Jude, showing what the
primitive faith was, how near it and how excellent that of the Church of
England, also the danger of departing from it.I visited the Bishop of Rochester, at Bromley, and
dined at Sir Philip Warwick's, at Frogpoole [Frognall].I went to see Dulwich College, being the pious
foundation of one Alleyn, a famous comedian, in King James's time.The
chapel is pretty, the rest of the hospital very ill contrived; it yet
maintains divers poor of both sexes.It is in a melancholy part of
Camberwell parish.I came back by certain medicinal Spa waters, at a
place called Sydenham Wells, in Lewisham parish, much frequented in
summer.I was casually shown the Duchess of Portsmouth's
splendid apartment at Whitehall, luxuriously furnished, and with ten
times the richness and glory beyond the Queen's; such massy pieces of
plate, whole tables, and stands of incredible value.I saw the Italian Scaramuccio act before the King
at Whitehall, people giving money to come in, which was very scandalous,
and never so before at Court diversions.Having seen him act before in
Italy, many years past, I was not averse from seeing the most excellent
of that kind of folly.Dined at Kensington with my old acquaintance, Mr.Henshaw, newly returned from Denmark, where he had been left resident
after the death of the Duke of Richmond, who died there Ambassador.I got an extreme cold, such as was afterward so
epidemical, as not only to afflict us in this island, but was rife over
all Europe, like a plague.It was after an exceedingly dry summer and
autumn.I settled affairs, my son being to go into France with my Lord Berkeley,
designed Ambassador-extraordinary for France and Plenipotentiary for the
general treaty of peace at Nimeguen.Dined at Lord Chamberlain's with the Holland
Ambassador L. Duras, a valiant gentleman whom his Majesty made an
English Baron, of a cadet, and gave him his seat of Holmby, in
Northamptonshire.Lord Berkeley coming into Council, fell down in the
gallery at Whitehall, in a fit of apoplexy, and being carried into my
Lord Chamberlain's lodgings, several famous doctors were employed all
that night, and with much ado he was at last recovered to some sense, by
applying hot fire pans and spirit of amber to his head; but nothing was
found so effectual as cupping him on the shoulders.It was almost a
miraculous restoration.The next day he was carried to Berkeley House.This stopped his journey for the present, and caused my stay in town.He
had put all his affairs and his whole estate in England into my hands
during his intended absence, which though I was very unfit to undertake,
in regard of many businesses which then took me up, yet, upon the great
importunity of my lady and Mr.Godolphin (to whom I could refuse
nothing) I did take it on me.It seems when he was Deputy in Ireland,
not long before, he had been much wronged by one he left in trust with
his affairs, and therefore wished for some unmercenary friend who would
take that trouble on him; this was to receive his rents, look after his
houses and tenants, solicit supplies from the Lord Treasurer, and
correspond weekly with him, more than enough to employ any drudge in
England; but what will not friendship and love make one do?Dined at my Lord Chamberlain's, with my son.There
were the learned Isaac Vossius, and Spanhemius, son of the famous man of
Heidelberg; nor was this gentleman less learned, being a general
scholar.Among other pieces, he was author of an excellent treatise on
Medals.Being the day appointed for my Lord Ambassador to
set out, I met them with my coach at New Cross.There were with him my
Lady his wife, and my dear friend, Mrs.Godolphin, who, out of an
extraordinary friendship, would needs accompany my lady to Paris, and
stay with her some time, which was the chief inducement for permitting
my son to travel, but I knew him safe under her inspection, and in
regard my Lord himself had promised to take him into his special favor,
he having intrusted all he had to my care.Thus we set out three coaches (besides mine), three wagons, and about
forty horses.It being late, and my Lord as yet but valetudinary, we got
but to Dartford, the first day, the next to Sittingbourne.Cony, then an officer of mine for the sick
and wounded of that place, gave the ladies a handsome refreshment as we
came by his house.[Sidenote: DOVER]

12th November, 1675.We came to Canterbury: and, next morning, to Dover.There was in my Lady Ambassadress's company my Lady Hamilton, a
sprightly young lady, much in the good graces of the family, wife of
that valiant and worthy gentleman, George Hamilton, not long after slain
in the wars.She had been a maid of honor to the Duchess, and now turned
<DW7>.Being Sunday, my Lord having before delivered to me
his letter of attorney, keys, seal, and his Will, we took a solemn leave
of one another upon the beach, the coaches carrying them into the sea to
the boats, which delivered them to Captain Gunman's yacht, the "Mary."Being under sail, the castle gave them seventeen guns, which Captain
Gunman answered with eleven.Hence, I went to church, to beg a blessing
on their voyage.Being returned home, I visited Lady Mordaunt at
Parson's Green, my Lord, her son, being sick.This pious woman delivered
to me L100 to bestow as I thought fit for the release of poor prisoners,
and other charitable uses.Visited her Ladyship again, where I found the
Bishop of Winchester, whom I had long known in France; he invited me to
his house at Chelsea.Lady Sunderland gave me ten guineas, to bestow in
charities.Gunning, Bishop of Ely, preached before the
King from St.21, 22, 23, chiefly against an anonymous book,
called "Naked Truth," a famous and popular treatise against the
corruption in the Clergy, but not sound as to its quotations, supposed
to have been the Bishop of Hereford's and was answered by Dr.Turner, it
endeavoring to prove an equality of order of Bishop and Presbyter.Pritchard, Bishop of Gloucester, preached at
Whitehall, on Isaiah v.5, very allegorically, according to his manner,
yet very gravely and wittily.Povey, one of the Masters of
Requests, a nice contriver of all elegancies, and exceedingly formal.Supped with Sir J. Williamson, where were of our Society Mr.Robert
Boyle, Sir Christopher Wren, Sir William Petty, Dr.Holden, subdean of
his Majesty's Chapel, Sir James Shaen, Dr.Whistler, and our Secretary,
Mr.Sir Thomas Linch was returned from his government of
Jamaica.The Countess of Sunderland and I went by water to
Parson's Green, to visit my Lady Mordaunt, and to consult with her about
my Lord's monument.Lloyd, late Curate of Deptford, but now Bishop of
Llandaff, preached before the King, on 1 Cor.57, that though sin
subjects us to death, yet through Christ we become his conquerors.To Twickenham Park, Lord Berkeley's country seat, to
examine how the bailiffs and servants ordered matters.Brideoake, Bishop of Chichester, preached a mean
discourse for a Bishop.Fleetwood, Bishop of Worcester,
on Matt.38, of the sorrows of Christ, a deadly sorrow caused by
our sins; he was no great preacher.Dining with my Lady Sunderland, I saw a fellow swallow
a knife, and divers great pebble stones, which would make a plain
rattling one against another.The knife was in a sheath of horn.North, son of my Lord North, preached before the King, on Isaiah
liii.57, a very young but learned and excellent person.This was
the first time the Duke appeared no more in chapel, to the infinite
grief and threatened ruin of this poor nation.I had now notice that my dear friend Mrs.Godolphin, was
returning from Paris.On the 6th, she arrived to my great joy, whom I
most heartily welcomed.My wife entertained her Majesty at Deptford, for which
the Queen gave me thanks in the withdrawing room at Whitehall.The University of Oxford presented me with the "_Marmora Oxoniensia
Arundeliana_"; the Bishop of Oxford writing to desire that I would
introduce Mr.Prideaux, the editor (a young man most learned in
antiquities) to the Duke of Norfolk, to present another dedicated to his
Grace, which I did, and we dined with the Duke at Arundel House, and
supped at the Bishop of Rochester's with Isaac Vossius.I spoke to the Duke of York about my Lord Berkeley's
going to Nimeguen.Thence, to the Queen's Council at Somerset House,
about Mrs.Godolphin's lease of Spalding, in Lincolnshire.Montague's new palace, near Bloomsbury, built by Mr.Hooke, of our
Society, after the French manner.[36]

    [Footnote 36: Now the British Museum.]Returned home, and found my son returned from France;
praised be God!A chaplain of my Lord Ossory's preached,
after which we took barge to Trinity House in London.Pepys
(Secretary of the Admiralty) succeeded my Lord as Master.[Sidenote: ENFIELD]

2d June, 1676.I went with my Lord Chamberlain to see a garden, at
Enfield town; thence, to Mr.It
is a very pretty place, the house commodious, the gardens handsome, and
our entertainment very free, there being none but my Lord and myself.That which I most wondered at was, that, in the compass of twenty-five
miles, yet within fourteen of London, there is not a house, barn,
church, or building, besides three lodges.To this Lodge are three great
ponds, and some few inclosures, the rest a solitary desert, yet stored
with no less than 3,000 deer.These are pretty retreats for gentlemen,
especially for those who are studious and lovers of privacy.We returned in the evening by Hampstead, to see Lord Wotton's house and
garden (Bellsize House), built with vast expense by Mr.O'Neale, an
Irish gentleman who married Lord Wotton's mother, Lady Stanhope.The
furniture is very particular for Indian cabinets, porcelain, and other
solid and noble movables.The gallery very fine, the gardens very large,
but ill kept, yet woody and chargeable.The soil a cold weeping clay,
not answering the expense.I went to see Sir Thomas Bond's new and fine house by
Peckham; it is on a flat, but has a fine garden and prospect through the
meadows to London.Castillion, Prebend of Canterbury, preached before
the King, on John xv.Went to the funeral of Sir William Sanderson, husband
to the Mother of the Maids, and author of two large but mean histories
of King James and King Charles I. He was buried at Westminster.James's Chapel,
was christened a daughter of Dr.Leake's, the Duke's Chaplain:
godmothers were Lady Mary, daughter of the Duke of York, and the Duchess
of Monmouth: godfather, the Earl of Bath.Came to dine with me my Lord Halifax, Sir Thomas
Meeres, one of the Commissioners of the Admiralty, Sir John Clayton, Mr.Dined with Sir John Banks at his house in Lincoln's
Inn Fields, on recommending Mr.Upman to be tutor to his son going into
France.This Sir John Banks was a merchant of small beginning, but had
amassed L100,000.I dined at the Admiralty with Secretary Pepys, and
supped at the Lord Chamberlain's.Here was Captain Baker, who had been
lately on the attempt of the Northwest passage.He reported prodigious
depth of ice, blue as a sapphire, and as transparent.The thick mists
were their chief impediment, and cause of their return.I paid L1,700 to the Marquis de Sissac, which he had
lent to my Lord Berkeley, and which I heard the Marquis lost at play in
a night or two.The Dean of Chichester preached before the King, on Acts xxiv.Crichton preached the second sermon before him on Psalm xc.12, of
wisely numbering our days, and well employing our time.Dined at Captain Graham's, where I became acquainted
with Dr.Compton (brother to the Earl of Northampton), now Bishop of
London, and Mr.North, son to the Lord North, brother to the Lord
Chief-Justice and Clerk of the Closet, a most hopeful young man.The
Bishop had once been a soldier, had also traveled in Italy, and became a
most sober, grave, and excellent prelate.Supped at the Lord Chamberlain's, where also supped
the famous beauty and errant lady, the Duchess of Mazarine (all the
world knows her story), the Duke of Monmouth, Countess of Sussex (both
natural children of the King by the Duchess of Cleveland[37]), and the
Countess of Derby, a virtuous lady, daughter to my best friend, the Earl
of Ossory.[Footnote 37: Evelyn makes a slip here.The Duke of Monmouth's
    mother was, it is well known, Lucy Walters, sometimes called Mrs.Barlow, and heretofore mentioned in the "Diary."Nor is he more
    correct as to the Countess of Sussex.Lady Anne Fitzroy, as she is
    called in the Peerage books, was married to Lennard Dacre, Earl of
    Sussex, by whom she left a daughter only, who succeeded on her
    father's death to the Barony of Dacre.On the other hand, the Duke
    of Southampton, the Duke of Grafton, and the Duke of Northumberland,
    were all of them children of Charles II.by the Duchess of
    Cleveland.]Flamsted, the learned astrologer
and mathematician, whom his Majesty had established in the new
Observatory in Greenwich Park, furnished with the choicest instruments.To London, to take order about the building of a
house, or rather an apartment, which had all the conveniences of a
house, for my dear friend, Mr.Godolphin and lady, which I undertook to
contrive and survey, and employ workmen until it should be quite
finished; it being just over against his Majesty's wood-yard by the
Thames side, leading to Scotland Yard.To Lambeth, to that rare magazine of marble, to
take order for chimney-pieces, etc., for Mr.The
owner of the works had built for himself a pretty dwelling house; this
Dutchman had contracted with the Genoese for all their marble.We also
saw the Duke of Buckingham's glasswork, where they made huge vases of
metal as clear, ponderous, and thick as crystal; also looking-glasses
far larger and better than any that come from Venice.Godolphin and my wife to Blackwall,
to see some Indian curiosities; the streets being slippery, I fell
against a piece of timber with such violence that I could not speak nor
fetch my breath for some space; being carried into a house and let
blood, I was removed to the water-side and so home, where, after a day's
rest, I recovered.This being one of my greatest deliverances, the Lord
Jesus make me ever mindful and thankful!Being my birthday, and fifty-six years old, I spent
the morning in devotion and imploring God's protection, with solemn
thanksgiving for all his signal mercies to me, especially for that
escape which concerned me this month at Blackwall.Godolphin, and returned home through a prodigious and dangerous mist.Finished the lease of Spalding, for Mr.My son and I dining at my Lord Chamberlain's, he
showed us among others that incomparable piece of Raphael's, being a
Minister of State dictating to Guicciardini, the earnestness of whose
face looking up in expectation of what he was next to write, is so to
the life, and so natural, as I esteem it one of the choicest pieces of
that admirable artist.There was a woman's head of Leonardo da Vinci; a
Madonna of old Palma, and two of Vandyke's, of which one was his own
picture at length, when young, in a leaning posture; the other, an
eunuch, singing.I saw the great ball danced by all the gallants and
ladies at the Duchess of York's.There fell so deep a snow as hindered us from
church.[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th December, 1676.To London, in so great a snow, as I remember not
to have seen the like.More snow falling, I was not able to get to church.I went to Roehampton, with my Lady Duchess of
Ormond.The garden and perspective is pretty, the prospect most
agreeable.Came the Earl of Peterborough, to desire me to be a
trustee for Lord Viscount Mordaunt and the Countess, for the sale of
certain lands set out by Act of Parliament, to pay debts.I went to London, to give the Lord Ambassador Berkeley
(now returned from the treaty at Nimeguen) an account of the great trust
reposed in me during his absence, I having received and remitted to him
no less than L20,000 to my no small trouble and loss of time, that
during his absence, and when the Lord Treasurer was no great friend [of
his] I yet procured him great sums, very often soliciting his Majesty in
his behalf; looking after the rest of his estates and concerns entirely,
without once accepting any kind of acknowledgment, purely upon the
request of my dear friend, Mr.I returned with abundance of
thanks and professions from my Lord Berkeley and my Lady.This business being now at an end, and myself delivered
from that intolerable servitude and correspondence, I had leisure to be
somewhat more at home and to myself.I sealed the deeds of sale of the manor of Blechingley to
Sir Robert Clayton, for payment of Lord Peterborough's debts, according
to the trust of the Act of Parliament.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

16th July, 1677.Evans, curate of Abinger,
preached an excellent sermon on Matt.Duncomb's, at Sheere, whose house stands
environed with very sweet and quick streams.Bohun, my Son's late tutor, preached at Abinger, on
Phil., iv.I went to visit my Lord Brounker, now taking the
waters at Dulwich.Dined at the Earl of Peterborough's the day after the
marriage of my Lord of Arundel to Lady Mary Mordaunt, daughter of the
Earl of Peterborough.To visit my Lord Chamberlain, in Suffolk; he sent his
coach and six to meet and bring me from St.Edmund's Bury to Euston.We hunted in the Park and killed a very fat buck.I went to visit my Lord Crofts, now dying at St.Edmunds Bury, and took the opportunity to see this ancient town, and the
remains of that famous monastery and abbey.There is little standing
entire, save the gatehouse; it has been a vast and magnificent Gothic
structure, and of great extent.The gates are wood, but quite plated
over with iron.There are also two stately churches, one especially.I went to Thetford, to the borough-town, where
stand the ruins of a religious house: there is a round mountain
artificially raised, either for some castle, or monument, which makes a
pretty landscape.As we went and returned, a tumbler showed his
extraordinary address in the Warren.I also saw the Decoy; much pleased
with the stratagem.There dined this day at my Lord's one Sir John
Gaudy, a very handsome person, but quite dumb, yet very intelligent by
signs, and a very fine painter; he was so civil and well bred, as it was
not possible to discern any imperfection in him.His lady and children
were also there, and he was at church in the morning with us.A stranger preached at Euston Church, and fell into
a handsome panegyric on my Lord's new building the church, which indeed
for its elegance and cheerfulness, is one of the prettiest country
churches in England.My Lord told me his heart smote him that, after he
had bestowed so much on his magnificent palace there, he should see
God's House in the ruin it lay in.He has also rebuilt the
parsonage-house, all of stone, very neat and ample.[Sidenote: EUSTON]

10th September, 1677.To divert me, my Lord would needs carry me to see
Ipswich, when we dined with one Mr.Mann by the way, who was Recorder of
the town.There were in our company my Lord Huntingtower, son to the
Duchess of Lauderdale, Sir Edward Bacon, a learned gentleman of the
family of the great Chancellor Verulam, and Sir John Felton, with some
other knights and gentlemen.After dinner came the bailiff and
magistrates in their formalities with their maces to compliment my Lord,
and invite him to the town-house, where they presented us a collation of
dried sweetmeats and wine, the bells ringing, etc.Then, we went to see
the town, and first, the Lord Viscount Hereford's house, which stands in
a park near the town, like that at Brussels, in Flanders; the house not
great, yet pretty, especially the hall.The stews for fish succeeded one
another, and feed one the other, all paved at bottom.There is a good
picture of the blessed virgin in one of the parlors, seeming to be of
Holbein, or some good master.Then we saw the Haven, seven miles from
Harwich.The tide runs out every day, but the bedding being soft mud, it
is safe for shipping and a station.The trade of Ipswich is for the most
part Newcastle coals, with which they supply London; but it was formerly
a clothing town.There is not any beggar asks alms in the whole place, a
thing very extraordinary, so ordered by the prudence of the magistrates.It has in it fourteen or fifteen beautiful churches: in a word, it is
for building, cleanness, and good order, one of the best towns in
England.Cardinal Wolsey was a butcher's son of Ipswich, but there is
little of that magnificent Prelate's foundation here, besides a school
and I think a library, which I did not see.His intentions were to build
some great thing.We returned late to Euston, having traveled about
fifty miles this day.Since first I was at this place, I found things exceedingly improved.It is seated in a bottom between two graceful swellings, the main
building being now in the figure of a Greek II with four pavilions, two
at each corner, and a break in the front, railed and balustered at the
top, where I caused huge jars to be placed full of earth to keep them
steady upon their pedestals between the statues, which make as good a
show as if they were of stone, and, though the building be of brick, and
but two stories besides cellars and garrets covered with blue slate, yet
there is room enough for a full court, the offices and outhouses being
so ample and well disposed.The King's apartment is painted _a fresco_,
and magnificently furnished.There are many excellent pictures of the
great masters.The gallery is a pleasant, noble room; in the break, or
middle, is a billiard table, but the wainscot, being of fir, and
painted, does not please me so well as Spanish oak without paint.The
chapel is pretty, the porch descending to the gardens.The orange garden
is very fine, and leads into the greenhouse, at the end of which is a
hall to eat in, and the conservatory some hundred feet long, adorned
with maps, as the other side is with the heads of the Caesars, ill cut in
alabaster; above are several apartments for my Lord, Lady, and Duchess,
with kitchens and other offices below, in a lesser form; lodgings for
servants, all distinct for them to retire to when they please and would
be in private, and have no communication with the palace, which he tells
me he will wholly resign to his son-in-law and daughter, that charming
young creature.The canal running under my Lady's dressing room chamber window, is full
of carps and fowl, which come and are fed there.The cascade at the end
of the canal turns a cornmill that provides the family, and raises water
for the fountains and offices.To pass this canal into the opposite
meadows, Sir Samuel Morland has invented a screw bridge, which, being
turned with a key, lands you fifty feet distant at the entrance of an
ascending walk of trees, a mile in length,--as it is also on the front
into the park,--of four rows of ash trees, and reaches to the park pale,
which is nine miles in compass, and the best for riding and meeting the
game that I ever saw.There were now of red and fallow deer almost a
thousand, with good covert, but the soil barren and flying sand, in
which nothing will grow kindly.The tufts of fir, and much of the other
wood, were planted by my direction some years before.This seat is
admirably placed for field sports, hawking, hunting, or racing.The
mutton is small, but sweet.The stables hold thirty horses and four
coaches.The out-offices make two large quadrangles, so as servants
never lived with more ease and convenience; never master more civil.Strangers are attended and accommodated as at their home, in pretty
apartments furnished with all manner of conveniences and privacy.There is a library full of excellent books; bathing rooms, elaboratory,
dispensary, a decoy, and places to keep and fat fowl in.He had now in
his new church (near the garden) built a dormitory, or vault, with
several repositories, in which to bury his family.In the expense of this pious structure, the church is most laudable,
most of the houses of God in this country resembling rather stables and
thatched cottages than temples in which to serve the Most High.He has
built a lodge in the park for the keeper, which is a neat dwelling, and
might become any gentleman.The same has he done for the parson, little
deserving it for murmuring that my Lord put him some time out of his
wretched hovel, while it was building.He has also erected a fair inn at
some distance from his palace, with a bridge of stone over a river near
it, and repaired all the tenants' houses, so as there is nothing but
neatness and accommodations about his estate, which I yet think is not
above L1,500 a year.I believe he had now in his family one hundred
domestic servants.His lady (being one of the Brederode's daughters, grandchild to a
natural son of Henry Frederick, Prince of Orange) is a good-natured and
obliging woman.They love fine things, and to live easily, pompously,
and hospitably; but, with so vast expense, as plunges my Lord into debts
exceedingly.My Lord himself is given into no expensive vice but
building, and to have all things rich, polite, and princely.He never
plays, but reads much, having the Latin, French, and Spanish tongues in
perfection.He has traveled much, and is the best bred and courtly
person his Majesty has about him, so as the public Ministers more
frequent him than any of the rest of the nobility.While he was
Secretary of State and Prime Minister, he had gotten vastly, but spent
it as hastily, even before he had established a fund to maintain his
greatness; and now beginning to decline in favor (the Duke being no
great friend of his), he knows not how to retrench.He was son of a
Doctor of Laws, whom I have seen, and, being sent from Westminster
School to Oxford, with intention to be a divine, and parson of
Arlington, a village near Brentford, when Master of Arts the Rebellion
falling out, he followed the King's Army, and receiving an HONORABLE
WOUND IN THE FACE, grew into favor, and was advanced from a mean
fortune, at his Majesty's Restoration, to be an Earl and Knight of the
Garter, Lord Chamberlain of the Household, and first favorite for a long
time, during which the King married his natural son, the Duke of
Grafton, to his only daughter and heiress, as before mentioned, worthy
for her beauty and virtue of the greatest prince in Christendom.My Lord
is, besides this, a prudent and understanding person in business, and
speaks well; unfortunate yet in those he has advanced, most of them
proving ungrateful.The many obligations and civilities I have received
from this noble gentleman, extracts from me this character, and I am
sorry he is in no better circumstances.Having now passed near three weeks at Euston, to my great satisfaction,
with much difficulty he suffered me to look homeward, being very earnest
with me to stay longer; and, to engage me, would himself have carried me
to Lynn-Regis, a town of important traffic, about twenty miles beyond,
which I had never seen; as also the Traveling Sands, about ten miles
wide of Euston, that have so damaged the country, rolling from place to
place, and, like the Sands in the Deserts of Lybia, quite overwhelmed
some gentlemen's whole estates, as the relation extant in print, and
brought to our Society, describes at large.My Lord's coach conveyed me to Bury, and thence
baiting at Newmarket, stepping in at Audley-End to see that house again,
I slept at Bishop-Stortford, and, the next day, home.I was accompanied
in my journey by Major Fairfax, of a younger house of the Lord Fairfax,
a soldier, a traveler, an excellent musician, a good-natured, well-bred
gentleman.Phillips (nephew of Milton) to the
service of my Lord Chamberlain, who wanted a scholar to read to and
entertain him sometimes.With Sir Robert Clayton to Marden, an estate he had
bought lately of my kinsman, Sir John Evelyn, of Godstone, in Surrey,
which from a despicable farmhouse Sir Robert had erected into a seat
with extraordinary expense.It is in such a solitude among hills, as,
being not above sixteen miles from London, seems almost incredible, the
ways up to it are so winding and intricate.The gardens are large, and
well-walled, and the husbandry part made very convenient and perfectly
understood.The barns, the stacks of corn, the stalls for cattle, pigeon
house, etc., of most laudable example.Innumerable are the plantations
of trees, especially walnuts.The orangery and gardens are very curious.He and his lady (who is very
curious in distillery) entertained me three or four days very freely.I
earnestly suggested to him the repairing of an old desolate dilapidated
church, standing on the hill above the house, which I left him in good
disposition to do, and endow it better; there not being above four or
five houses in the parish, besides that of this prodigious rich
Scrivener.This place is exceedingly sharp in the winter, by reason of
the serpentining of the hills: and it wants running water; but the
solitude much pleased me.All the ground is so full of wild thyme,
marjoram, and other sweet plants, that it cannot be overstocked with
bees; I think he had near forty hives of that industrious insect.I went to church at Godstone, and to see old Sir
John Evelyn's DORMITORY, joining to the church, paved with marble, where
he and his Lady lie on a very stately monument at length; he in armor of
white marble.The inscription is only an account of his particular
branch of the family, on black marble.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th October, 1677.Returned to London; in the evening, I saw the Prince
of Orange, and supped with Lord Ossory.Saw again the Prince of Orange; his marriage with the
Lady Mary, eldest daughter to the Duke of York, by Mrs.Hyde, the late
Duchess, was now declared.I was all this week composing matters between old
Mrs.Howard and Sir Gabriel Sylvius, upon his long and earnest addresses
to Mrs.Anne, her second daughter, maid of honor to the Queen.Godolphin (who exceedingly loved the young lady) was most
industrious in it, out of pity to the languishing knight; so as though
there were great differences in their years, it was at last effected,
and they were married the 13th, in Henry VII.'s Chapel, by the Bishop of
Rochester, there being besides my wife and Mrs.We dined at the old lady's, and supped at
Mr.The Queen's birthday, a great ball at Court, where
the Prince of Orange and his new Princess danced.They went away, and I saw embarked my Lady Sylvius,
who went into Holland with her husband, made Hoffmaester to the Prince,
a considerable employment.We parted with great sorrow, for the great
respect and honor I bore her, a most pious and virtuous lady.Dined at the Lord Treasurer's with Prince Rupert,
Viscount Falkenburg, Earl of Bath, Lord O'Brien, Sir John Lowther, Sir
Christopher Wren, Dr.Sir Joseph Williamson, Principal Secretary of
State, was chosen President of the Royal Society, after my Lord Viscount
Brouncker had possessed the chair now sixteen years successively, and
therefore now thought fit to CHANGE, that prescription might not
prejudice.Being the first day of his taking the chair, he gave
us a magnificent supper.Carried to my Lord Treasurer an account of the Earl
of Bristol's Library, at Wimbledon, which my Lord thought of purchasing,
till I acquainted him that it was a very broken collection, consisting
much in books of judicial astrology, romances, and trifles.I gave my son an office, with instructions how to
govern his youth; I pray God give him the grace to make a right use of
it!Dined with the Duke of Norfolk, being the first
time I had seen him since the death of his elder brother, who died at
Padua in Italy, where he had resided above thirty years.The Duke had
now newly declared his marriage to his concubine, whom he promised me he
never would marry.I went with him to see the Duke of Buckingham, thence
to my Lord Sunderland, now Secretary of State, to show him that rare
piece of Vosterman's (son of old Vosterman), which was a view, or
landscape of my Lord's palace, etc., at Althorpe in Northamptonshire.Supping at my Lord Chamberlain's I had a long
discourse with the Count de Castel Mellor, lately Prime Minister in
Portugal, who, taking part with his master, King Alphonso, was banished
by his brother, Don Pedro, now Regent; but had behaved himself so
uncorruptly in all his ministry that, though he was acquitted, and his
estate restored, yet would they not suffer him to return.He is a very
intelligent and worthy gentleman.My Lord Treasurer sent for me to accompany him to
Wimbledon, which he had lately purchased of the Earl of Bristol; so
breaking fast with him privately in his chamber, I accompanied him with
two of his daughters, my Lord Conway, and Sir Bernard Gascoyne; and,
having surveyed his gardens and alterations, returned late at night.[Sidenote: LONDON]

22d February, 1678.Pierce preached at Whitehall, on 2 Thessalonians
iii.6, against our late schismatics, in a rational discourse, but a
little over-sharp, and not at all proper for the auditory there.South preached _coram Rege_, an incomparable
discourse on this text, "A wounded spirit who can bear!"Note: Now was
our Communion table placed altarwise; the church steeple, clock, and
other reparations finished.I showed Don Emmanuel de Lyra (Portugal Ambassador)
and the Count de Castel Mellor, the Repository of the Royal Society, and
the College of Physicians.I went to see new Bedlam Hospital, magnificently
built, and most sweetly placed in Moorfields, since the dreadful fire in
London.I went to Windsor with my Lord Chamberlain (the castle
now repairing with exceeding cost) to see the rare work of Verrio, an
incomparable carving of Gibbons.Returned with my Lord by Hounslow Heath, where we saw
the newly raised army encamped, designed against France, in pretense, at
least; but which gave umbrage to the Parliament.His Majesty and a world
of company were in the field, and the whole army in battalia; a very
glorious sight.Now were brought into service a new sort of soldiers,
called GRENADIERS, who were dexterous in flinging hand grenades,
everyone having a pouch full; they had furred caps with coped crowns
like Janizaries, which made them look very fierce, and some had long
hoods hanging down behind, as we picture fools.Their clothing being
likewise piebald, yellow and red.Came to dine with me my Lord Longford, Treasurer of
Ireland, nephew to that learned gentleman, my Lord Aungier, with whom I
was long since acquainted; also the Lady Stidolph, and other company.The Earl of Ossory came to take his leave of me, going
into Holland to command the English forces.I went to the Tower to try a metal at the
Assay-master's, which only proved sulphur; then saw Monsieur Rotiere,
that excellent graver belonging to the Mint, who emulates even the
ancients, in both metal and stone;[38] he was now molding a horse for
the King's statue, to be cast in silver, of a yard high.[Footnote 38: Doubtless Philip Rotiere, who introduced the figure of
    Britannia into the coinage, taking for his model the King's
    favorite, Frances Stewart, Duchess of Richmond.]Elias Ashmole's library and curiosities,
at Lambeth.He had divers MSS., but most of them astrological, to which
study he is addicted, though I believe not learned, but very
industrious, as his History of the order of the Garter proves.He showed
me a toad included in amber.The prospect from a turret is very fine, it
being so near London, and yet not discovering any house about the
country.The famous John Tradescant bequeathed his Repository to this
gentleman, who has given them to the University of Oxford, and erected a
lecture on them, over the laboratory, in imitation of the Royal Society.Godolphin was made master of the robes to the King.There was sent me L70; from whom I knew not, to be by
me distributed among poor people; I afterward found it was from that
dear friend (Mrs.Godolphin), who had frequently given me large sums to
bestow on charities.I went to Lady Mordaunt, who put L100 into my hand to
dispose of for pious uses, relief of prisoners, poor, etc.Many a sum
had she sent me on similar occasions; a blessed creature she was, and
one that loved and feared God exemplarily.[Sidenote: WEYBRIDGE]

23d August, 1678.Upon Sir Robert Reading's importunity, I went to visit
the Duke of Norfolk, at his new palace at Weybridge, where he has laid
out in building near L10,000, on a copyhold, and in a miserable, barren,
sandy place by the street side; never in my life had I seen such expense
to so small purpose.The rooms are wainscotted, and some of them richly
pargeted with cedar, yew, cypress, etc.There are some good pictures,
especially that incomparable painting of Holbein's, where the Duke of
Norfolk, Charles Brandon and Henry VIII., are dancing with the three
ladies, with most amorous countenances, and sprightly motion exquisitely
expressed.It is a thousand pities (as I told my Lord of Arundel, his
son), that that jewel should be given away.Alban's house, at
Byfleet, an old, large building.Thence, to the papermills, where I
found them making a coarse white paper.They cull the rags which are
linen for white paper, woolen for brown; then they stamp them in troughs
to a pap, with pestles, or hammers, like the powder mills, then put it
into a vessel of water, in which they dip a frame closely wired with
wire as small as a hair and as close as a weaver's reed; on this they
take up the pap, the superfluous water draining through the wire; this
they dexterously turning, shake out like a pancake on a smooth board
between two pieces of flannel, then press it between a great press, the
flannel sucking out the moisture; then, taking it out, they ply and dry
it on strings, as they dry linen in the laundry; then dip it in alum
water, lastly, polish and make it up in quires.They put some gum in the
water in which they macerate the rags.The mark we find on the sheets is
formed in the wire.Sheldon (nephew to
the late Archbishop of Canterbury), and his pretty melancholy garden; I
took notice of the largest _arbor thuyris_ I had ever seen.The place is
finely watered, and there are many curiosities of India, shown in the
house.There was at Weybridge the Duchess of Norfolk, Lord Thomas Howard (a
worthy and virtuous gentleman, with whom my son was sometime bred in
Arundel House), who was newly come from Rome, where he had been some
time; also one of the Duke's daughters, by his first lady.My Lord
leading me about the house made no scruple of showing me all the hiding
places for the Popish priests, and where they said mass, for he was no
bigoted <DW7>.He told me he never trusted them with any secret, and
used Protestants only in all businesses of importance.I went this evening with my Lord Duke to Windsor, where was a
magnificent Court, it being the first time of his Majesty's removing
thither since it was repaired.I took leave of the Duke, and dined at Mr.Henry
Bruncker's, at the Abbey of Sheene, formerly a monastery of Carthusians,
there yet remaining one of their solitary cells with a cross.Within
this ample inclosure are several pretty villas and fine gardens of the
most excellent fruits, especially Sir William Temple's (lately
Ambassador into Holland), and the Lord Lisle's, son to the Earl of
Leicester, who has divers rare pictures, above all, that of Sir Brian
Tuke's, by Holbein.After dinner I walked to Ham, to see the house and garden of the Duke of
Lauderdale, which is indeed inferior to few of the best villas in Italy
itself; the house furnished like a great Prince's; the parterres,
flower-gardens, orangeries, groves, avenues, courts, statues,
perspectives, fountains, aviaries, and all this at the banks of the
sweetest river in the world, must needs be admirable.Hence, I went to my worthy friend, Sir Henry Capel [at Kew], brother to
the Earl of Essex; it is an old timber-house; but his garden has the
choicest fruit of any plantation in England, as he is the most
industrious and understanding in it.I was called to London to wait upon the Duke of
Norfolk, who having at my sole request bestowed the Arundelian Library
on the Royal Society; sent to me to take charge of the books, and remove
them, only stipulating that I would suffer the Herald's chief officer,
Sir William Dugdale, to have such of them as concerned heraldry and the
marshal's office, books of armory and genealogies, the Duke being Earl
Marshal of England.I procured for our Society, besides printed books,
near one hundred MSS.The printed
books being of the oldest impressions, are not the less valuable; I
esteem them almost equal to MSS.Among them, are most of the Fathers,
printed at Basil, before the Jesuits abused them with their expurgatory
Indexes; there is a noble MS.Many of these books had been
presented by Popes, Cardinals, and great persons, to the Earls of
Arundel and Dukes of Norfolk; and the late magnificent Earl of Arundel
bought a noble library in Germany, which is in this collection.I should
not, for the honor I bear the family, have persuaded the Duke to part
with these, had I not seen how negligent he was of them, suffering the
priests and everybody to carry away and dispose of what they pleased; so
that abundance of rare things are irrecoverably gone.Having taken order here, I went to the Royal Society to give them an
account of what I had procured, that they might call a Council and
appoint a day to wait on the Duke to thank him for this munificent gift.[Sidenote: LONDON]

3d September, 1678.I went to London, to dine with Mrs.Godolphin, and
found her in labor; she was brought to bed of a son, who was baptized in
the chamber, by the name of Francis, the susceptors being Sir William
Godolphin (head of the family), Mr.John Hervey, Treasurer to the Queen,
and Mrs.Boscawen, sister to Sir William and the father.While I was at church came a letter from Mr.Godolphin, that my dear friend his lady was exceedingly ill, and
desiring my prayers and assistance.My wife and I took boat immediately,
and went to Whitehall, where, to my inexpressible sorrow, I found she
had been attacked with a new fever, then reigning this excessive hot
autumn, and which was so violent, that it was not thought she could last
many hours.She died in the 26th year of her age, to the
inexpressible affliction of her dear husband, and all her relations, but
of none in the world more than of myself, who lost the most excellent
and inestimable friend that ever lived.Never was a more virtuous and
inviolable friendship; never a more religious, discreet, and admirable
creature, beloved of all, admired of all, for all possible perfections
of her sex.She is gone to receive the reward of her signal charity, and
all other her Christian graces, too blessed a creature to converse with
mortals, fitted as she was, by a most holy life, to be received into the
mansions above.She was for wit, beauty, good nature, fidelity,
discretion, and all accomplishments, the most incomparable person.How
shall I ever repay the obligations to her for the infinite good offices
she did my soul by so often engaging me to make religion the terms and
tie of the friendship there was between us!She was the best wife, the
best mistress, the best friend, that ever husband had.But it is not
here that I pretend to give her character, HAVING DESIGNED TO CONSECRATE
HER WORTHY LIFE TO POSTERITY.Her husband, struck with unspeakable affliction, fell down as dead.The
King himself, and all the Court, expressed their sorrow.To the poor and
miserable, her loss was irreparable; for there was no degree but had
some obligation to her memory.So careful and provident was she to be
prepared for all possible accidents, that (as if she foresaw her end)
she received the heavenly viaticum but the Sunday before, after a most
solemn recollection.She put all her domestic concerns into the exactest
order, and left a letter directed to her husband, to be opened in case
she died in childbed, in which with the most pathetic and endearing
expressions of the most loyal and virtuous wife, she begs his kindness
to her memory might be continued by his care and esteem of those she
left behind, even to her domestic servants, to the meanest of which she
left considerable legacies, as well as to the poor.It was now seven
years since she was maid of honor to the Queen, that she regarded me as
a father, a brother, and what is more, a friend.We often prayed,
visited the sick and miserable, received, read, discoursed, and
communicated in all holy offices together.She was most dear to my wife,
and affectionate to my children.This only is my
comfort, that she is happy in Christ, and I shall shortly behold her
again.She desired to be buried in the dormitory of his family, near
three hundred miles from all her other friends.So afflicted was her
husband at this severe loss, that the entire care of her funeral was
committed to me.Having closed the eyes, and dropped a tear upon the
cheek of my dear departed friend, lovely even in death, I caused her
corpse to be embalmed and wrapped in lead, a plate of brass soldered
thereon, with an inscription, and other circumstances due to her worth,
with as much diligence and care as my grieved heart would permit me; I
then retired home for two days, which were spent in solitude and sad
reflection.She was, accordingly, carried to Godolphin, in
Cornwall, in a hearse with six horses, attended by two coaches of as
many, with about thirty of her relations and servants.There accompanied
the hearse her husband's brother, Sir William, two more of his brothers,
and three sisters; her husband was so overcome with grief, that he was
wholly unfit to travel so long a journey, till he was more composed.I
went as far as Hounslow with a sad heart; but was obliged to return upon
some indispensable affairs.The corpse was ordered to be taken out of
the hearse every night, and decently placed in the house, with tapers
about it, and her servants attending, to Cornwall; and then was
honorably interred in the parish church of Godolphin.This funeral cost
not much less than L1,000.Godolphin, I looked over and sorted his lady's papers, most of
which consisted of Prayers, Meditations, Sermon-notes, Discourses, and
Collections on several religious subjects, and many of her own happy
composing, and so pertinently digested, as if she had been all her life
a student in divinity.We found a diary of her solemn resolutions,
tending to practical virtue, with letters from select friends, all put
into exact method.It astonished us to see what she had read and
written, her youth considered.[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st October, 1678.The Parliament and the whole Nation were alarmed
about a conspiracy of some eminent <DW7>s for the destruction of the
King and introduction of Popery, discovered by one Oates and Dr.Tongue,[39] WHICH LAST I KNEW, BEING THE TRANSLATOR OF THE "Jesuits'
Morals"; I went to see and converse with him at Whitehall, with Mr.Oates, one that was lately an apostate to the church of Rome, and now
returned again with this discovery.He seemed to be a bold man, and, in
my thoughts, furiously indiscreet; but everybody believed what he said;
and it quite changed the genius and motions of the Parliament, growing
now corrupt and interested with long sitting and court practices; but,
with all this, Popery would not go down.This discovery turned them all
as one man against it, and nothing was done but to find out the depth of
this.Oates was encouraged, and everything he affirmed taken for gospel;
the truth is, the Roman Catholics were exceedingly bold and busy
everywhere, since the Duke forbore to go any longer to the chapel.[Footnote 39: Ezrael Tonge was bred in University College, Oxford,
    and being puritanically inclined, quitted the University; but in
    1648 returned, and was made a Fellow.He had the living of Pluckley,
    in Kent, which he resigned in consequence of quarrels with his
    parishioners and Quakers.In 1657, he was made fellow of the
    newly-erected College at Durham, and that being dissolved in 1660,
    he taught school at Islington.He then went with Colonel Edward
    Harley to Dunkirk, and subsequently took a small living in
    Herefordshire (Lentwardine); but quitted it for St.Mary Stayning,
    in London, which, after the fire in 1666, was united to St.These he held till his death, in 1680.He was a great
    opponent of the Roman Catholics.Wood mentions several publications
    of his, among which are, "The Jesuits Unmasked," 1678; "Jesuitical
    Aphorisms," 1678; and "The Jesuits' Morals," 1680 (1670); the two
    latter translated from the French.(Wood's "_Athenae, Oxon._" vol.Evelyn speaks of the last of these translations as
    having been executed by his desire: and it figures in a notable
    passage of Oates's testimony.Oates said, for example, "that Thomas
    Whitbread, a priest, on 13th of June, 16.did tell the rector of
    St.Omer's that a Minister of the Church of England had scandalously
    put out the 'Jesuits' Morals' in English, and had endeavored to
    render them odious, and had asked the Rector whether he thought
    Oates might know him?and the Rector called, the deponent, who heard
    these words as he stood at the chamber door, and when he went into
    the chamber of the Provincial, he asked him 'If he knew the author
    of the "Jesuits' Morals?"'deponent answered, 'His person, but not
    his name.'Whitbread then demanded, whether he would undertake to
    poison, or assassinate the author; which deponent undertook, having
    L50 reward promised him, and appointed to return to England."]Godolphin requested me to continue the trust his
wife had reposed in me, in behalf of his little son, conjuring me to
transfer the friendship I had for his dear wife, on him and his.The murder of Sir Edmondbury Godfrey, found
strangled about this time, as was manifest, by the <DW7>s, he being the
Justice of the Peace, and one who knew much of their practices, as
conversant with Coleman (a servant of the... now accused), put the
whole nation into a new ferment against them.Being the 58th of my age, required my humble
addresses to Almighty God, and that he would take off his heavy hand,
still on my family; and restore comforts to us after the death of my
excellent friend.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1678.Tillotson preached before the Commons at St.He said the <DW7>s were now arrived at that impudence, as
to deny that there ever was any such as the gunpowder-conspiracy; but he
affirmed that he himself had several letters written by Sir Everard
Digby (one of the traitors), in which he gloried that he was to suffer
for it; and that it was so contrived, that of the <DW7>s not above two
or three should have been blown up, and they, such as were not worth
saving.I never saw the Court more
brave, nor the nation in more apprehension and consternation.Coleman
and one Staly had now been tried, condemned, and executed.On this,
Oates grew so presumptuous as to accuse the Queen of intending to poison
the King; which certainly that pious and virtuous lady abhorred the
thoughts of, and Oates's circumstances made it utterly unlikely in my
opinion.He probably thought to gratify some who would have been glad
his Majesty should have married a fruitful lady; but the King was too
kind a husband to let any of these make impression on him.However,
divers of the Popish peers were sent to the Tower, accused by Oates; and
all the Roman Catholic lords were by a new Act forever excluded the
Parliament; which was a mighty blow.The King's, Queen's, and Duke's
servants, were banished, and a test to be taken by everybody who
pretended to enjoy any office of public trust, and who would not be
suspected of Popery.I went with Sir William Godolphin, a member of the
Commons' House, to the Bishop of Ely (Dr.Peter Gunning), to be resolved
whether masses were idolatry, as the text expressed it, which was so
worded, that several good Protestants scrupled, and Sir William, though
a learned man and excellent divine himself, had some doubts about it.The Bishop's opinion was that he might take it, though he wished it had
been otherwise worded in the text.I went with my Lady Sunderland to Chelsa, and
dined with the Countess of Bristol [her mother] in the great house,
formerly the Duke of Buckingham's, a spacious and excellent place for
the extent of ground and situation in a good air.The house is large but
ill-contrived, though my Lord of Bristol, who purchased it after he sold
Wimbledon to my Lord Treasurer, expended much money on it.There were
divers pictures of Titian and Vandyke, and some of Bassano, very
excellent, especially an Adonis and Venus, a Duke of Venice, a butcher
in his shambles selling meat to a Swiss; and of Vandyke, my Lord of
Bristol's picture, with the Earl of Bedford's at length, in the same
table.There was in the garden a rare collection of orange trees, of
which she was pleased to bestow some upon me.Houblon's, a French merchant, who had his house furnished _en Prince_,
and gave us a splendid entertainment.The Long Parliament, which had sat ever since the
Restoration, was dissolved by persuasion of the Lord Treasurer, though
divers of them were believed to be his pensioner.At this, all the
politicians were at a stand, they being very eager in pursuit of the
late plot of the <DW7>s.Cudworth preached before the King at Whitehall,
on 2 Timothy iii.5, reckoning up the perils of the last times, in
which, among other wickedness, treasons should be one of the greatest,
applying it to the occasion, as committed under a form of reformation
and godliness; concluding that the prophecy did intend more particularly
the present age, as one of the last times; the sins there enumerated,
more abundantly reigning than ever.[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d February, 1679.Durell, Dean of Windsor, preached to the
household at Whitehall, on 1 Cor.22; he read the whole sermon out
of his notes, which I had never before seen a Frenchman do, he being of
Jersey, and bred at Paris.Pierce, Dean of Salisbury, preached on 1 John,
iv.1, "Try the Spirits, there being so many delusory ones gone forth of
late into the world"; he inveighed against the pernicious doctrines of
Mr.My brother Evelyn, was now chosen Knight for the County of Surrey,
carrying it against my Lord Longford and Sir Adam Brown, of Bechworth
Castle.The country coming in to give him their suffrages were so many,
that I believe they ate and drank him out near L2,000, by a most
abominable custom.Godolphin, was now made one of the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury, and of the Privy Council.The Bishop of Gloucester preached in a manner very like
Bishop Andrews, full of divisions, and scholastical, and that with much
quickness.Our vicar preached exceedingly well on 1
Cor.The Holy Communion followed, at which I and my daughter, Mary
(now about fourteen years old), received for the first time.The Lord
Jesus continue his grace unto her, and improve this blessed beginning!The Duke of York, voted against by the Commons for his
recusancy, went over to Flanders; which made much discourse.Pepys in the Tower, he having been
committed by the House of Commons for misdemeanors in the Admiralty when
he was secretary; I believe he was unjustly charged.Here I saluted my
Lords Stafford and Petre, who were committed for the Popish plot.I saw the magnificent cavalcade and entry of the
Portugal Ambassador.I was godfather to a son of Sir Christopher Wren,
surveyor of his Majesty's buildings, that most excellent and learned
person, with Sir William Fermor, and my Lady Viscountess Newport, wife
of the Treasurer of the Household.Thence to Chelsea, to Sir Stephen Fox, and my lady, in order to the
purchase of the Countess of Bristol's house there, which she desired me
to procure a chapman for.I dined at Sir Robert Clayton's with Sir Robert Viner,
the great banker.There were now divers Jesuits executed about the plot,
and a rebellion in Scotland of the fanatics, so that there was a sad
prospect of public affairs.The new Commissioners of the Admiralty came to visit
me, viz, Sir Henry Capell, brother to the Earl of Essex, Mr.Finch,
eldest son to the Lord Chancellor, Sir Humphry Winch, Sir Thomas Meeres,
Mr.Hales, with some of the Commissioners of the Navy.I dined at Sir William Godolphin's, and with that
learned gentleman went to take the air in Hyde Park, where was a
glorious _cortege_.Sending a piece of venison to Mr.Pepys, still a
prisoner, I went and dined with him.Now were there papers, speeches, and libels, publicly
cried in the streets against the Dukes of York and Lauderdale, etc.,
obnoxious to the Parliament, with too much and indeed too shameful a
liberty; but the people and Parliament had gotten head by reason of the
vices of the great ones.[Sidenote: LONDON]

There was now brought up to London a child, son of one Mr.Wotton,
formerly amanuensis to Dr.Andrews, Bishop of Winton, who both read and
perfectly understood Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Arabic, Syriac, and most of
the modern languages; disputed in divinity, law, and all the sciences;
was skillful in history, both ecclesiastical and profane; in politics;
in a word, so universally and solidly learned at eleven years of age,
that he was looked on as a miracle.Lloyd, one of the most deeply
learned divines of this nation in all sorts of literature, with Dr.Burnet, who had severely examined him, came away astonished, and they
told me they did not believe there had the like appeared in the world.He had only been instructed by his father, who being himself a learned
person, confessed that his son knew all that he himself knew.But, what
was more admirable than his vast memory, was his judgment and invention,
he being tried with divers hard questions, which required maturity of
thought and experience.He was also dexterous in chronology,
antiquities, mathematics.In sum, an _intellectus universalis_, beyond
all that we read of Picus Mirandula, and other precocious wits, and yet
withal a very humble child.I went to see how things stood at Parson's Green, my
Lady Viscountess Mordaunt (now sick in Paris, whither she went for
health) having made me a trustee for her children, an office I could not
refuse to this most excellent, pious, and virtuous lady, my long
acquaintance.Sidney Godolphin, now one of the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury.I went early to the Old Bailey Sessions House, to the
famous trial of Sir George Wakeman, one of the Queen's physicians, and
three Benedictine monks; the first (whom I was well acquainted with, and
take to be a worthy gentleman abhorring such a fact), for intending to
poison the King; the others as accomplices to carry on the plot, to
subvert the government, and introduce Popery.The bench was crowded with
the judges, Lord Mayor justices, and innumerable spectators.Oates (as he called himself), and one Bedlow, a man of
inferior note.Their testimonies were not so pregnant, and I fear much
of it from hearsay, but swearing positively to some particulars, which
drew suspicion upon their truth; nor did circumstances so agree, as to
give either the bench or jury so entire satisfaction as was expected.After, therefore, a long and tedious trial of nine hours, the jury
brought them in not guilty, to the extraordinary triumph of the <DW7>s,
and without sufficient disadvantage and reflections on witnesses,
especially Oates and Bedlow.This was a happy day for the lords in the Tower, who, expecting their
trial, had this gone against the prisoners at the bar, would all have
been in the utmost hazard.For my part, I look on Oates as a vain,
insolent man, puffed up with the favor of the Commons for having
discovered something really true, more especially as detecting the
dangerous intrigue of Coleman, proved out of his own letters, and of a
general design which the Jesuited party of the <DW7>s ever had and
still have, to ruin the Church of England; but that he was trusted with
those great secrets he pretended, or had any solid ground for what he
accused divers noblemen of, I have many reasons to induce my contrary
belief.That among so many commissions as he affirmed to have delivered
to them from P. Oliva[40] and the Pope,--he who made no scruple of
opening all other papers, letters, and secrets, should not only not open
any of those pretended commissions, but not so much as take any copy or
witness of any one of them, is almost miraculous.But the Commons (some
leading persons I mean of them) had so exalted him that they took all he
said for Gospel, and without more ado ruined all whom he named to be
conspirators; nor did he spare whoever came in his way.But, indeed, the
murder of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, suspected to have been compassed by
the Jesuits' party for his intimacy with Coleman (a busy person whom I
also knew), and the fear they had that he was able to have discovered
things to their prejudice, did so exasperate not only the Commons, but
all the nation, that much of these sharpnesses against the more honest
Roman Catholics who lived peaceably, is to be imputed to that horrid
fact.[Footnote 40: Padre Oliva, General of the Order of Jesuits.]The sessions ended, I dined or rather supped (so late it was) with the
judges in the large room annexed to the place, and so returned home.Though it was not my custom or delight to be often present at any
capital trials, we having them commonly so exactly published by those
who take them in short-hand, yet I was inclined to be at this signal
one, that by the ocular view of the carriages and other circumstances of
the managers and parties concerned, I might inform myself, and regulate
my opinion of a cause that had so alarmed the whole nation.Dined at Clapham, at Sir D. Gauden's; went thence with
him to Windsor, to assist him in a business with his Majesty.I lay that
night at Eton College, the Provost's lodgings (Dr.Craddock), where I
was courteously entertained.[Sidenote: LONDON]

23d July, 1679.To Court: after dinner, I visited that excellent
painter, Verrio, whose works in _fresco_ in the King's palace, at
Windsor, will celebrate his name as long as those walls last.He showed
us his pretty garden, choice flowers, and curiosities, he himself being
a skillful gardener.I went to Clifden, that stupendous natural rock, wood, and prospect, of
the Duke of Buckingham's, and buildings of extraordinary expense.The
grots in the chalky rocks are pretty: it is a romantic object, and the
place altogether answers the most poetical description that can be made
of solitude, precipice, prospect, or whatever can contribute to a thing
so very like their imaginations.The stand, somewhat like Frascati as to
its front, and on the platform is a circular view to the utmost verge of
the horizon, which, with the serpenting of the Thames, is admirable.The
staircase is for its materials singular; the cloisters, descents,
gardens, and avenue through the wood, august and stately; but the land
all about wretchedly barren, and producing nothing but fern.Indeed, as
I told his Majesty that evening (asking me how I liked Clifden) without
flattery, that it did not please me so well as Windsor for the prospect
and park, which is without compare; there being but one only opening,
and that narrow, which led one to any variety; whereas that of Windsor
is everywhere great and unconfined.Returning, I called at my cousin Evelyn's, who has a very pretty seat in
the forest, two miles by hither Clifden, on a flat, with gardens
exquisitely kept, though large, and the house a staunch good old
building, and what was singular, some of the rooms floored dove
tail-wise without a nail, exactly close.One of the closets is pargeted
with plain deal, set in diamond, exceeding staunch and pretty.Dined at the Sheriff's, when, the Company of Drapers
and their wives being invited, there was a sumptuous entertainment,
according to the forms of the city, with music, etc., comparable to any
prince's service in Europe.I went this morning to show my Lord Chamberlain, his
Lady, and the Duchess of Grafton, the incomparable work of Mr.Gibbon,
the carver, whom I first recommended to his Majesty, his house being
furnished like a cabinet, not only with his own work, but divers
excellent paintings of the best hands.Thence, to Sir Stephen Fox's,
where we spent the day.After evening service, to see a neighbor, one Mr.Bohun, related to my son's late tutor of that name, a rich Spanish
merchant, living in a neat place, which he has adorned with many
curiosities, especially several carvings of Mr.Gibbons, and some
pictures by Streeter.To Windsor, to congratulate his Majesty on his
recovery; I kissed the Duke's hand, now lately returned from
Flanders[41] to visit his brother the King, on which there were various
bold and foolish discourses, the Duke of Monmouth being sent away.[Footnote 41: He returned the day before, the 12th of September.This is another of the indications that the entries of this Diary
    were not always made on the precise days they refer to.]My Lord Sunderland, one of the principal
Secretaries of State, invited me to dinner, where was the King's natural
son, the Earl of Plymouth, the Earl of Shrewsbury, Earl of Essex, Earl
of Mulgrave, Mr.After dinner I went to prayers
at Eton, and visited Mr.Henry Godolphin, fellow there, and Dr.Slingsby and Signor Verrio came to dine with
me, to whom I gave China oranges off my own trees, as good, I think, as
were ever eaten.Dined at my Lord Chamberlain's, the King being now
newly returned from his Newmarket recreations.Dined at the Lord Mayor's; and, in the evening, went
to the funeral of my pious, dear, and ancient learned friend, Dr.Jasper
Needham, who was buried at St.He was a true and holy
Christian, and one who loved me with great affection.Dove preached
with an eulogy due to his memory.I lost in this person one of my
dearest remaining sincere friends.I was invited to dine at my Lord Teviotdale's, a
Scotch Earl, a learned and knowing nobleman.Montague's new palace near Bloomsbury, built by our curator, Mr.Hooke, somewhat after the French; it was most nobly furnished, and a
fine, but too much exposed garden.[42]

6th November, 1679.Dined at the Countess of Sunderland's, and was this
evening at the remarriage of the Duchess of Grafton to the Duke (his
Majesty's natural son), she being now twelve years old.The ceremony was
performed in my Lord Chamberlain's (her father's) lodgings at Whitehall
by the Bishop of Rochester, his Majesty being present.A sudden and
unexpected thing, when everybody believed the first marriage would have
come to nothing; but, the measure being determined, I was privately
invited by my Lady, her mother, to be present.I confess I could give
her little joy, and so I plainly told her, but she said the King would
have it so, and there was no going back.This sweetest, most hopeful,
most beautiful, child, and most virtuous, too, was sacrificed to a boy
that had been rudely bred, without anything to encourage them but his
Majesty's pleasure.I pray God the sweet child find it to her advantage,
who, if my augury deceive me not, will in a few years be such a paragon
as were fit to make the wife of the greatest Prince in Europe!I staid
supper, where his Majesty sat between the Duchess of Cleveland (the
mother of the Duke of Grafton) and the sweet Duchess the bride; there
were several great persons and ladies, without pomp.My love to my Lord
Arlington's family, and the sweet child made me behold all this with
regret, though as the Duke of Grafton affects the sea, to which I find
his father intends to use him, he may emerge a plain, useful and robust
officer: and were he polished, a tolerable person; for he is exceedingly
handsome, by far surpassing any of the King's other natural issue.At Sir Stephen Fox's, and was agreeing for the
Countess of Bristol's house at Chelsea, within L500.I dined at my Lord Mayor's, being desired by the
Countess of Sunderland to carry her thither on a solemn day, that she
might see the pomp and ceremony of this Prince of Citizens, there never
having been any, who for the stateliness of his palace, prodigious
feasting, and magnificence, exceeded him.This Lord Mayor's acquaintance
had been from the time of his being apprentice to one Mr.Abbot, his
uncle, who being a scrivener, and an honest worthy man, one who was
condemned to die at the beginning of the troubles forty years past, as
concerned in the commission of array for King Charles I. had escaped
with his life; I often used his assistance in money matters.Robert
Clayton, then a boy, his nephew, became, after his uncle Abbot's death,
so prodigiously rich and opulent, that he was reckoned one of the
wealthiest citizens.He married a free-hearted woman, who became his
hospitable disposition; and having no children, with the accession of
his partner and fellow apprentice, who also left him his estate, he grew
excessively rich.He was a discreet magistrate, and though envied, I
think without much cause.Some believed him guilty of hard dealing,
especially with the Duke of Buckingham, much of whose estate he had
swallowed, but I never saw any ill by him, considering the trade he was
of.The reputation and known integrity of his uncle, Abbot, brought all
the royal party to him, by which he got not only great credit, but vast
wealth, so as he passed this office with infinite magnificence and
honor.Slingsby, Master of the Mint, with
my wife, invited to hear music, which was exquisitely performed by four
of the most renowned masters: Du Prue, a Frenchman, on the lute; Signor
Bartholomeo, an Italian, on the harpsichord; Nicholao on the violin;
but, above all, for its sweetness and novelty, the _viol d'amore_ of
five wire strings played on with a bow, being but an ordinary violin,
played on lyre-way, by a German.There was also a _flute douce_, now in
much request for accompanying the voice.Slingsby, whose son and
daughter played skillfully, had these meetings frequently in his house.I dined at my Lord Mayor's, to accompany my
worthiest and generous friend, the Earl of Ossory; it was on a Friday, a
private day, but the feast and entertainment might have become a King.Such an hospitable costume and splendid magistrature does no city in the
world show, as I believe.Allestree preached before the household on St.20, before the King, showing with
how little reason the <DW7>s applied those words of our blessed Savior
to maintain the pretended infallibility they boast of.I never heard a
more Christian and excellent discourse; yet were some offended that he
seemed to say the Church of Rome was a true church; but it was a
captious mistake; for he never affirmed anything that could be more to
their reproach, and that such was the present Church of Rome, showing
how much it had erred.There was not in this sermon so much as a shadow
for censure, no person of all the clergy having testified greater zeal
against the errors of the <DW7>s than this pious and most learned
person.I dined at the Bishop of Rochester's, and then went to St.Paul's to hear that great wit, Dr.His talent was a great memory,
never making use of notes, a readiness of expression in a most pure and
plain style of words, full of matter, easily delivered.I met the Earl of Clarendon with the rest of my
fellow executors of the Will of my late Lady Viscountess Mordaunt,
namely, Mr.Laurence Hyde, one of the Commissioners of the Treasury, and
lately Plenipotentiary-Ambassador at Nimeguen; Andrew Newport; and Sir
Charles Wheeler; to examine and audit and dispose of this year's account
of the estate of this excellent Lady, according to the direction of her
Will.I went to see Sir John Stonehouse, with whom I was
treating a marriage between my son and his daughter-in-law.Came over the Duke of Monmouth from Holland
unexpectedly to his Majesty; while the Duke of York was on his journey
to Scotland, whither the King sent him to reside and govern.The bells
and bonfires of the city at this arrival of the Duke of Monmouth
publishing their joy, to the no small regret of some at Court.This
Duke, whom for distinction they called the Protestant Duke (though the
son of an abandoned woman), the people made their idol.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th December, 1679.I dined, together with Lord Ossory and the Earl of
Chesterfield, at the Portugal Ambassador's, now newly come, at Cleveland
House, a noble palace, too good for that infamous.... The staircase is
sumptuous, and the gallery and garden; but, above all, the costly
furniture belonging to the Ambassador, especially the rich Japan
cabinets, of which I think there were a dozen.There was a billiard
table, with as many more hazards as ours commonly have; the game being
only to prosecute the ball till hazarded, without passing the port, or
touching the pin; if one miss hitting the ball every time, the game is
lost, or if hazarded.It is more difficult to hazard a ball, though so
many, than in our table, by reason the bound is made so exactly even,
and the edges not stuffed; the balls are also bigger, and they for the
most part use the sharp and small end of the billiard stick, which is
shod with brass, or silver.The entertainment was exceedingly civil;
but, besides a good olio, the dishes were trifling, hashed and condited
after their way, not at all fit for an English stomach, which is for
solid meat.There was yet good fowls, but roasted to coal, nor were the
sweetmeats good.I went to meet Sir John Stonehouse, and give him a
particular of the settlement on my son, who now made his addresses to
the young lady his daughter-in-law, daughter of Lady Stonehouse.Cave, author of "Primitive Christianity,"
etc., a pious and learned man, preached at Whitehall to the household,
on James iii.17, concerning the duty of grace and charity.I supped with Sir Stephen Fox, now made one of the
Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.The writings for the settling jointure and other
contracts of marriage of my son were finished and sealed.The lady was
to bring L5,000, in consideration of a settlement of L500 a year present
maintenance, which was likewise to be her jointure, and L500 a year
after mine and my wife's decease.But, with God's blessing, it will be
at the least L1,000 a year more in a few years.I pray God make him
worthy of it, and a comfort to his excellent mother, who deserves much
from him!Martha
Spencer, daughter to my Lady Stonehouse by a former gentleman, at St.Andrew's, Holborn, by our Vicar, borrowing the church of Dr.We afterward
dined at a house in Holborn; and, after the solemnity and dancing was
done, they were bedded at Sir John Stonehouse's lodgings in Bow Street,
Convent Garden.To the Royal Society, where I met an Irish Bishop
with his Lady, who was daughter to my worthy and pious friend, Dr.Jeremy Taylor, late Bishop of Down and Connor; they came to see the
Repository.She seemed to be a knowing woman, beyond the ordinary talent
of her sex.I dined at my Lord Mayor's, in order to the meeting of
my Lady Beckford, whose daughter (a rich heiress) I had recommended to
my brother of Wotton for his only son, she being the daughter of the
lady by Mr.To London, to receive L3,000 of my daughter-in-law's
portion, which was paid in gold.The Dean of Sarum preached on Jerem.5, an hour
and a half from his common-place book, of kings and great men retiring
to private situations.[Sidenote: CASHIOBURY]

18th April, 1680.On the earnest invitation of the Earl of Essex, I went
with him to his house at Cashiobury, in Hertfordshire.It was on Sunday,
but going early from his house in the square of St.James, we arrived by
ten o'clock; this he thought too late to go to church, and we had
prayers in his chapel.The house is new, a plain fabric, built by my
friend, Mr.There are divers fair and good rooms, and
excellent carving by Gibbons, especially the chimney-piece of the
library.There is in the porch, or entrance, a painting by Verrio, of
Apollo and the Liberal Arts.One room pargeted with yew, which I liked
well.Some of the chimney mantels are of Irish marble, brought by my
Lord from Ireland, when he was Lord-Lieutenant, and not much inferior to
Italian.The tympanum, or gable, at the front is a bass-relievo of Diana
hunting, cut in Portland stone, handsomely enough.I do not approve of
the middle doors being round: but, when the hall is finished as
designed, it being an oval with a cupola, together with the other wing,
it will be a very noble palace.The library is large, and very nobly
furnished, and all the books are richly bound and gilded; but there are
no MSS., except the Parliament Rolls and Journals, the transcribing and
binding of which cost him, as he assured me, L500.No man has been more industrious than this noble Lord in planting about
his seat, adorned with walks, ponds, and other rural elegancies; but the
soil is stony, churlish, and uneven, nor is the water near enough to the
house, though a very swift and clear stream runs within a flight-shot
from it in the valley, which may fitly be called Coldbrook, it being
indeed excessively cold, yet producing fair trouts.It is a pity the
house was not situated to more advantage: but it seems it was built just
where the old one was, which I believe he only meant to repair; this
leads men into irremediable errors, and saves but a little.The land about is exceedingly addicted to wood, but the coldness of the
place hinders the growth.Black cherry trees prosper even to
considerable timber, some being eighty feet long; they make also very
handsome avenues.There is a pretty oval at the end of a fair walk, set
about with treble rows of Spanish chestnut trees.The gardens are very rare, and cannot be otherwise, having so skillful
an artist to govern them as Mr.Cooke, who is, as to the mechanic part,
not ignorant in mathematics, and pretends to astrology.There is an
excellent collection of the choicest fruit.As for my Lord, he is a sober, wise, judicious, and pondering person,
not illiterate beyond the rate of most noblemen in this age, very well
versed in English history and affairs, industrious, frugal, methodical,
and every way accomplished.His Lady (being sister of the late Earl of
Northumberland) is a wise, yet somewhat melancholy woman, setting her
heart too much on the little lady, her daughter, of whom she is over
fond.My Lord was not long since come from his Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland,
where he showed his abilities in administration and government, as well
as prudence in considerably augmenting his estate without reproach.He
had been Ambassador-extraordinary in Denmark, and, in a word, such a
person as became the son of that worthy hero his father to be, the late
Lord Capel, who lost his life for King Charles I.

We spent our time in the mornings in walking, or riding, and contriving
[alterations], and the afternoons in the library, so as I passed my time
for three or four days with much satisfaction.He was pleased in
conversation to impart to me divers particulars of state, relating to
the present times.He being no great friend to the D---- was now laid
aside, his integrity and abilities being not so suitable in this
conjuncture.To a meeting of the executors of late Viscountess
Mordaunt's estate, to consider of the sale of Parson's Green, being in
treaty with Mr.Loftus, and to settle the half year's account.Was a meeting of the feoffees of the poor of our parish.This year I would stand one of the collectors of their rents, to give
example to others.My son was added to the feoffees.This afternoon came to visit me Sir Edward Deering, of Surrendon, in
Kent, one of the Lords of the Treasury, with his daughter, married to my
worthy friend, Sir Robert Southwell, Clerk of the Council, now
Extraordinary-Envoy to the Duke of Brandenburgh, and other Princes in
Germany, as before he had been in Portugal, being a sober, wise, and
virtuous gentleman.Shish, master-shipwright
of his Majesty's Yard here, an honest and remarkable man, and his death
a public loss, for his excellent success in building ships (though
altogether illiterate), and for breeding up so many of his children to
be able artists.I held up the pall with three knights, who did him that
honor, and he was worthy of it.It was the custom of this good man to
rise in the night, and to pray, kneeling in his own coffin, which he had
lying by him for many years.He was born that famous year, the
Gunpowder-plot, 1605.Came to dine with us the Countess of Clarendon, Dr.Lloyd, Dean of Bangor (since Bishop of St.Burnet, author of
the "History of the Reformation," and my old friend, Mr.After
dinner we all went to see the Observatory, and Mr.Flamsted, who showed
us divers rare instruments, especially the great quadrant.[Sidenote: WINDSOR]

24th July, 1680.Went with my wife and daughter to Windsor, to see that
stately court, now near finished.There was erected in the court the
King on horseback, lately cast in copper, and set on a rich pedestal of
white marble, the work of Mr.Gibbons, at the expense of Toby Rustate, a
page of the back stairs, who by his wonderful frugality had arrived to a
great estate in money, and did many works of charity, as well as this of
gratitude to his master, which cost him L1,000.He is very simple,
ignorant, but honest and loyal creature.We all dined at the Countess of Sunderland's, afterward to see Signor
Verrio's garden, thence to Eton College, to salute the provost, and
heard a Latin speech of one of the alumni (it being at the election) and
were invited to supper; but took our leave, and got to London that night
in good time.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th July, 1680.My most noble and illustrious friend, the Earl of
Ossory, espying me this morning after sermon in the privy gallery,
calling to me, told me he was now going his journey (meaning to Tangier,
whither he was designed Governor, and General of the forces, to regain
the losses we had lately sustained from the Moors, when Inchiquin was
Governor).I asked if he would not call at my house (as he always did
whenever he went out of England on any exploit).He said he must embark
at Portsmouth, "wherefore let you and me dine together to-day; I am
quite alone, and have something to impart to you; I am not well, shall
be private, and desire your company."Being retired to his lodgings, and set down on a couch, he sent to his
secretary for the copy of a letter which he had written to Lord
Sunderland (Secretary of State), wishing me to read it; it was to take
notice how ill he resented it, that he should tell the King before Lord
Ossory's face, that Tangier was not to be kept, but would certainly be
lost, and yet added that it was fit Lord Ossory should be sent, that
they might give some account of it to the world, meaning (as supposed)
the next Parliament, when all such miscarriages would probably be
examined; this Lord Ossory took very ill of Lord Sunderland, and not
kindly of the King, who resolving to send him with an incompetent force,
seemed, as his Lordship took it, to be willing to cast him away, not
only on a hazardous adventure, but in most men's opinion, an
impossibility, seeing there was not to be above 300 or 400 horse, and
4,000 foot for the garrison and all, both to defend the town, form a
camp, repulse the enemy, and fortify what ground they should get in.This touched my Lord deeply, that he should be so little considered as
to put him on a business in which he should probably not only lose his
reputation, but be charged with all the miscarriage and ill success;
whereas, at first they promised 6,000 foot and 600 horse effective.My Lord, being an exceedingly brave and valiant person, and who had so
approved himself in divers signal battles, both at sea and land; so
beloved and so esteemed by the people, as one they depended on, upon all
occasions worthy of such a captain;--he looked on this as too great an
indifference in his Majesty, after all his services, and the merits of
his father, the Duke of Ormond, and a design of some who envied his
virtue.It certainly took so deep root in his mind, that he who was the
most void of fear in the world (and assured me he would go to Tangier
with ten men if his Majesty commanded him) could not bear up against
this unkindness.Having disburdened himself of this to me after dinner,
he went with his Majesty to the sheriffs at a great supper in
Fishmongers' Hall; but finding himself ill, took his leave immediately
of his Majesty, and came back to his lodging.Not resting well this
night, he was persuaded to remove to Arlington House, for better
accommodation.His disorder turned to a malignant fever, which
increasing, after all that six of the most able physicians could do, he
became delirious, with intervals of sense, during which Dr.Lloyd (after
Bishop of St.Asaph) administered the Holy Sacrament, of which I also
participated.He died the Friday following, the 30th of July, to the
universal grief of all that knew or heard of his great worth, nor had
any a greater loss than myself.Oft would he say I was the oldest
acquaintance he had in England (when his father was in Ireland), it
being now of about thirty years, contracted abroad, when he rode in the
Academy in Paris, and when we were seldom asunder.His Majesty never lost a worthier subject, nor father a better or more
dutiful son; a loving, generous, good-natured, and perfectly obliging
friend; one who had done innumerable kindnesses to several before they
knew it; nor did he ever advance any that were not worthy; no one more
brave, more modest; none more humble, sober, and every way virtuous.Unhappy England in this illustrious person's loss!Universal was the
mourning for him, and the eulogies on him; I stayed night and day by his
bedside to his last gasp, to close his dear eyes!O sad father, mother,
wife, and children!He deserved all that a sincere
friend, a brave soldier, a virtuous courtier, a loyal subject, an honest
man, a bountiful master, and good Christian, could deserve of his prince
and country.One thing more let me note, that he often expressed to me
the abhorrence he had of that base and unworthy action which he was put
upon, of engaging the Smyrna fleet in time of peace, in which though he
behaved himself like a great captain, yet he told me it was the only
blot in his life, and troubled him exceedingly.Though he was commanded,
and never examined further when he was so, yet he always spoke of it
with regret and detestation.The Countess was at the seat of her
daughter, the Countess of Derby, about 200 miles off.I went to visit a French gentleman, one Monsieur
Chardin, who having been thrice in the East Indies, Persia, and other
remote countries, came hither in our return ships from those parts, and
it being reported that he was a very curious and knowing man, I was
desired by the Royal Society to salute him in their name, and to invite
him to honor them with his company.Sir Joseph Hoskins and Sir
Christopher Wren accompanied me.We found him at his lodgings in his
eastern habit, a very handsome person, extremely affable, a modest,
well-bred man, not inclined to talk wonders.He spoke Latin, and
understood Greek, Arabic, and Persian, from eleven years' travels in
those parts, whither he went in search of jewels, and was become very
rich.After the usual civilities, we
asked some account of the extraordinary things he must have seen in
traveling over land to those places where few, if any, northern
Europeans used to go, as the Black and Caspian Sea, Mingrelia, Bagdad,
Nineveh, Persepolis, etc.He told us that the things most worthy of our
sight would be, the draughts he had caused to be made of some noble
ruins, etc.; for that, besides his own little talent that way, he had
carried two good painters with him, to draw landscapes, measure and
design the remains of the palace which Alexander burned in his frolic at
Persepolis, with divers temples, columns, relievos, and statues, yet
extant, which he affirmed to be sculpture far exceeding anything he had
observed either at Rome, in Greece, or in any other part of the world
where magnificence was in estimation.He said there was an inscription
in letters not intelligible, though entire.He was sorry he could not
gratify the curiosity of the Society at present, his things not being
yet out of the ship; but would wait on them with them on his return from
Paris, whither he was going the next day, but with intention to return
suddenly, and stay longer here, the persecution in France not suffering
Protestants, and he was one, to be quiet.He told us that Nineveh was a vast city, now all buried in her ruins,
the inhabitants building on the subterranean vaults, which were, as
appeared, the first stories of the old city, that there were frequently
found huge vases of fine earth, columns, and other antiquities; that the
straw which the Egyptians required of the Israelites, was not to burn,
or cover the rows of bricks as we use, but being chopped small to mingle
with the clay, which being dried in the sun (for they bake not in the
furnace) would else cleave asunder; that in Persia are yet a race of
Ignicolae, who worship the sun and the fire as Gods; that the women of
Georgia and Mingrelia were universally, and without any compare, the
most beautiful creatures for shape, features, and figure, in the world,
and therefore the Grand Seignor and Bashaws had had from thence most of
their wives and concubines; that there had within these hundred years
been Amazons among them, that is to say, a sort or race of valiant
women, given to war; that Persia was extremely fertile; he spoke also of
Japan and China, and of the many great errors of our late geographers,
as we suggested matter for discourse.We then took our leave, failing of
seeing his papers; but it was told us by others that indeed he dared not
open, or show them, till he had first showed them to the French King;
but of this he himself said nothing.[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d September, 1680.I had an opportunity, his Majesty being still at
Windsor, of seeing his private library at Whitehall, at my full ease.I
went with expectation of finding some curiosities, but, though there
were about 1,000 volumes, there were few of importance which I had not
perused before.They consisted chiefly of such books as had from time to
time been dedicated, or presented to him; a few histories, some Travels
and French books, abundance of maps and sea charts, entertainments and
pomps, buildings and pieces relating to the navy, some mathematical
instruments; but what was most rare, were three or four Romish
breviaries, with a great deal of miniature and monkish painting and
gilding, one of which is most exquisitely done, both as to the figures,
grotesques, and compartments, to the utmost of that curious art.There
is another in which I find written by the hand of King Henry VII., his
giving it to his dear daughter, Margaret, afterward Queen of Scots, in
which he desires her to pray for his soul, subscribing his name at
length.There is also the process of the philosophers' great elixir,
represented in divers pieces of excellent miniature, but the discourse
is in high Dutch, a MS.in quarto, of above 300
years old, in French, being an institution of physic, and in the
botanical part the plants are curiously painted in miniature; also a
folio MS.of good thickness, being the several exercises, as Themes,
Orations, Translations, etc., of King Edward VI., all written and
subscribed by his own hand, and with his name very legible, and divers
of the Greek interleaved and corrected after the manner of schoolboys'
exercises, and that exceedingly well and proper; with some epistles to
his preceptor, which show that young prince to have been extraordinarily
advanced in learning, and as Cardan, who had been in England affirmed,
stupendously knowing for his age.There is likewise his journal, no less
testifying his early ripeness and care about the affairs of state.There are besides many pompous volumes, some embossed with gold, and
intaglios on agates, medals, etc.I spent three or four entire days,
locked up, and alone, among these books and curiosities.In the rest of
the private lodgings contiguous to this, are divers of the best pictures
of the great masters, Raphael, Titian, etc., and in my esteem, above
all, the "_Noli me tangere_" of our blessed Savior to Mary Magdalen
after his Resurrection, of Hans Holbein; than which I never saw so much
reverence and kind of heavenly astonishment expressed in a picture.There are also divers curious clocks, watches, and pendules of exquisite
work, and other curiosities.An ancient woman who made these lodgings
clean, and had all the keys, let me in at pleasure for a small reward,
by means of a friend.I dined with Sir Stephen Fox, now one of the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury.This gentleman came first a poor boy from
the choir of Salisbury, then he was taken notice of by Bishop Duppa, and
afterward waited on my Lord Percy (brother to Algernon, Earl of
Northumberland), who procured for him an inferior place among the clerks
of the kitchen and Greencloth side, where he was found so humble,
diligent, industrious, and prudent in his behavior, that his Majesty
being in exile, and Mr.Fox waiting, both the King and Lords about him
frequently employed him about their affairs, and trusted him both with
receiving and paying the little money they had.Returning with his
Majesty to England, after great want and great sufferings, his Majesty
found him so honest and industrious, and withal so capable and ready,
that, being advanced from clerk of the kitchen to that of the
Greencloth, he procured to be paymaster of the whole army, and by his
dexterity and punctual dealing he obtained such credit among the
bankers, that he was in a short time able to borrow vast sums of them
upon any exigence.The continual turning thus of money, and the
soldiers' moderate allowance to him for keeping touch with them, did so
enrich him, that he is believed to be worth at least L200,000, honestly
got and unenvied; which is next to a miracle.With all this he continues
as humble and ready to do a courtesy as ever he was.He is generous, and lives very honorably, of a sweet nature,
well-spoken, well-bred, and is so highly in his Majesty's esteem, and so
useful, that being long since made a knight, he is also advanced to be
one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, and has the reversion of
the Cofferer's place after Harry Brouncker.He has married his eldest
daughter to my Lord Cornwallis, and gave her L12,000, and restored that
entangled family besides.Trollop, who brings
with her (besides a great sum) near, if not altogether, L2,000 per
annum.Sir Stephen's lady (an excellent woman) is sister to Mr.Whittle,
one of the King's chirurgeons.In a word, never was man more fortunate
than Sir Stephen; he is a handsome person, virtuous, and very religious.Came to my house some German strangers and Signor
Pietro, a famous musician, who had been long in Sweden in Queen
Christina's Court; he sung admirably to a guitar, and had a perfect good
tenor and bass, and had set to Italian composure many of Abraham
Cowley's pieces which showed extremely well.He told me that in Sweden
the heat in some part of summer was as excessive as the cold in winter;
so cold, he affirmed, that the streets of all the towns are desolate, no
creatures stirring in them for many months, all the inhabitants retiring
to their stoves.He spoke high things of that romantic Queen's learning
and skill in languages, the majesty of her behavior, her exceeding wit,
and that the histories she had read of other countries, especially of
Italy and Rome, had made her despise her own.That the real occasion of
her resigning her crown was the nobleman's importuning her to marry, and
the promise which the Pope had made her of procuring her to be Queen of
Naples, which also caused her to change her religion; but she was
cheated by his crafty Holiness,[43] working on her ambition; that the
reason of her killing her secretary at Fontainebleau, was, his revealing
that intrigue with the Pope.But, after all this, I rather believe it
was her mad prodigality and extreme vanity, which had consumed those
vast treasures the great Adolphus, her father, had brought out of
Germany during his [campaigns] there and wonderful successes; and that,
if she had not voluntarily resigned, as foreseeing the event, the
Estates of her kingdom would have compelled her to do so.[Footnote 43: Pope Alexander VII., of the family of Chighi, at
    Sienna.][Sidenote: LONDON]

30th October, 1680.I went to London to be private, my birthday being
the next day, and I now arrived at my sixtieth year; on which I began a
more solemn survey of my whole life, in order to the making and
confirming my peace with God, by an accurate scrutiny of all my actions
past, as far as I was able to call them to mind.How difficult and
uncertain, yet how necessary a work!The Lord be merciful to me, and
accept me!Teach me, therefore, so to
number my days, that I may apply my heart unto wisdom, and make my
calling and election sure.A stranger
preached at Whitehall[44] on Luke xvi.15; the
Holy Communion followed, at which I participated, humbly imploring God's
assistance in the great work I was entering into.Margaret's, on Acts xvii.[Footnote 44: Probably to the King's household, very early in the
    morning, as the custom was.]I began and spent the whole week in examining my life, begging pardon
for my faults, assistance and blessing for the future, that I might, in
some sort, be prepared for the time that now drew near, and not have the
great work to begin, when one can work no longer.I therefore stirred little abroad till the 5th of
November, when I heard Dr.Tenison, the now vicar of St.Lloyd, the former incumbent, being made Bishop of St.I participated of the blessed Communion, finishing
and confirming my resolutions of giving myself up more entirely to God,
to whom I had now most solemnly devoted the rest of the poor remainder
of life in this world; the Lord enabling me, who am an unprofitable
servant, a miserable sinner, yet depending on his infinite goodness and
mercy accepting my endeavors.Came to dine with us Sir Richard Anderson, his
lady, son and wife, sister to my daughter-in-law.[Sidenote: LONDON]

30th November, 1680.The anniversary election at the Royal Society
brought me to London, where was chosen President that excellent person
and great philosopher, Mr.Robert Boyle, who indeed ought to have been
the very first; but neither his infirmity nor his modesty could now any
longer excuse him.I desired I might for this year be left out of the
Council, by reason my dwelling was in the country.The Society according
to custom dined together.The signal day begun the trial (at which I was present) of my Lord
Viscount Stafford, (for conspiring the death of the King), second son to
my Lord Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel and Surrey, Earl Marshal of
England, and grandfather to the present Duke of Norfolk, whom I so well
knew, and from which excellent person I received so many favors.It was
likewise his birthday, The trial was in Westminster Hall, before the
King, Lords, and Commons, just in the same manner as, forty years past,
the great and wise Earl of Strafford (there being but one letter
differing their names) received his trial for pretended ill government
in Ireland, in the very same place, this Lord Stafford's father being
then High Steward.The place of sitting was now exalted some
considerable height from the paved floor of the hall, with a stage of
boards.The throne, woolsacks for the Judges, long forms for the Peers,
chair for the Lord Steward, exactly ranged, as in the House of Lords.The sides on both hands scaffolded to the very roof for the members of
the House of Commons.At the upper end, and on the right side of the
King's state, was a box for his Majesty, and on the left others for the
great ladies, and over head a gallery for ambassadors and public
ministers.At the lower end, or entrance, was a bar, and place for the
prisoner, the Lieutenant of the Tower of London, the ax-bearer and
guards, my Lord Stafford's two daughters, the Marchioness of Winchester
being one; there was likewise a box for my Lord to retire into.At the
right hand, in another box, somewhat higher, stood the witnesses; at the
left, the managers, in the name of the Commons of England, namely,
Serjeant Maynard (the great lawyer, the same who prosecuted the cause
against the Earl of Strafford forty years before, being now near eighty
years of age), Sir William Jones, late Attorney-General, Sir Francis
Winnington, a famous pleader, and Mr.Treby, now Recorder of London, not
appearing in their gowns as lawyers, but in their cloaks and swords, as
representing the Commons of England: to these were joined Mr.Poule, Colonel Titus, Sir Thomas Lee, all gentlemen
of quality, and noted parliamentary men.The first two days, in which
were read the commission and impeachment, were but a tedious entrance
into matter of fact, at which I was but little present.But, on
Thursday, I was commodiously seated among the Commons, when the
witnesses were sworn and examined.Oates
swore that he delivered a commission to Viscount Stafford from the Pope,
to be Paymaster-General to an army intended to be raised; Dugdale, that
being at Lord Aston's, the prisoner dealt with him plainly to murder his
Majesty; and Turberville, that at Paris he also proposed the same to
him.The depositions of my Lord's witnesses were taken, to
invalidate the King's witnesses; they were very slight persons, but,
being fifteen or sixteen, they took up all that day, and in truth they
rather did my Lord more injury than service.Came other witnesses of the Commons to corroborate
the King's, some being Peers, some Commons, with others of good quality,
who took off all the former day's objections, and set the King's
witnesses _recti in curia_.Sir William Jones summed up the evidence; to him
succeeded all the rest of the managers, and then Mr.Henry Poule made a
vehement oration.After this my Lord, as on all occasions, and often
during the trial, spoke in his own defense, denying the charge
altogether, and that he had never seen Oates, or Turberville, at the
time and manner affirmed: in truth, their testimony did little weigh
with me; Dugdale's only seemed to press hardest, to which my Lord spoke
a great while, but confusedly, without any method.One thing my Lord said as to Oates, which I confess did exceedingly
affect me: That a person who during his depositions should so vauntingly
brag that though he went over to the Church of Rome, yet he was never a
<DW7>, nor of their religion, all the time that he seemed to apostatize
from the Protestant, but only as a spy; though he confessed he took
their sacrament; worshiped images, went through all their oaths and
discipline of their proselytes, swearing secrecy and to be faithful, but
with intent to come over again and betray them; that such a hypocrite,
that had so deeply prevaricated as even to turn idolater (for so we of
the Church of England termed it), attesting God so solemnly that he was
entirely theirs and devoted to their interest, and consequently (as he
pretended) trusted; I say, that the witness of such a profligate wretch
should be admitted against the life of a peer,--this my Lord looked upon
as a monstrous thing, and such as must needs redound to the dishonor of
our religion and nation.And verily I am of his Lordship's opinion: such
a man's testimony should not be taken against the life of a dog.But the
merit of something material which he discovered against Coleman, put him
in such esteem with the Parliament, that now, I fancy, he stuck at
nothing, and thought everybody was to take what he said for Gospel.The
consideration of this, and some other circumstances, began to stagger
me; particularly how it was possible that one who went among the <DW7>s
on such a design, and pretended to be intrusted with so many letters and
commissions from the Pope and the party,--nay, and delivered them to so
many great persons,--should not reserve one of them to show, nor so much
as one copy of any commission, which he who had such dexterity in
opening letters might certainly have done, to the undeniable conviction
of those whom he accused; but, as I said, he gained credit on Coleman.But, as to others whom he so madly flew upon, I am little inclined to
believe his testimony, he being so slight a person, so passionate, ill
bred, and of such impudent behavior; nor is it likely that such piercing
politicians as the Jesuits should trust him with so high and so
dangerous secrets.On Tuesday, I was again at the trial, when judgment
was demanded; and, after my Lord had spoken what he could in denying the
fact, the managers answering the objections, the Peers adjourned to
their House, and within two hours returned again.There was, in the
meantime, this question put to the judges, "whether there being but one
witness to any single crime, or act, it could amount to convict a man of
treason."They gave an unanimous opinion that in case of treason they
all were overt acts for though no man should be condemned by one witness
for any one act, yet for several acts to the same intent, it was valid;
which was my Lord's case.This being past, and the Peers in their seats
again, the Lord Chancellor Finch (this day the Lord High-Steward)
removing to the woolsack next his Majesty's state, after summoning the
Lieutenant of the Tower to bring forth his prisoner, and proclamation
made for silence, demanded of every Peer (who were in all eighty-six)
whether William, Lord Viscount Stafford, were guilty of the treason laid
to his charge, or not guilty.Then the Peer spoken to, standing up, and laying his right hand upon his
breast, said guilty, or not guilty, upon my honor, and then sat down,
the Lord Steward noting their suffrages as they answered upon a paper:
when all had done, the number of not guilty being but 31, the guilty 55;
and then, after proclamation for silence again, the Lord Steward
directing his speech to the prisoner, against whom the ax was turned
edgeways and not before, in aggravation of his crime, he being ennobled
by the King's father, and since received many favors from his present
Majesty: after enlarging on his offense, deploring first his own
unhappiness that he who had never condemned any man before should now be
necessitated to begin with him, he then pronounced sentence of death by
hanging, drawing, and quartering, according to form, with great
solemnity and dreadful gravity; and, after a short pause, told the
prisoner that he believed the Lords would intercede for the omission of
some circumstances of his sentence, beheading only excepted; and then
breaking his white staff, the Court was dissolved.My Lord Stafford
during all this latter part spoke but little, and only gave their
Lordships thanks after the sentence was pronounced; and indeed behaved
himself modestly, and as became him.It was observed that all his own relations of his name and family
condemned him, except his nephew, the Earl of Arundel, son to the Duke
of Norfolk.And it must be acknowledged that the whole trial was carried
on with exceeding gravity: so stately and august an appearance I had
never seen before; for, besides the innumerable spectators of gentlemen
and foreign ministers, who saw and heard all the proceedings, the
prisoner had the consciences of all the Commons of England for his
accusers, and all the Peers to be his judges and jury.He had likewise
the assistance of what counsel he would, to direct him in his plea, who
stood by him.And yet I can hardly think that a person of his age and
experience should engage men whom he never saw before (and one of them
that came to visit him as a stranger at Paris) POINT BLANK to murder the
King: God only, who searches hearts, can discover the truth.Lord
Stafford was not a man beloved especially of his own family.This evening, looking out of my chamber window
toward the west, I saw a meteor of an obscure bright color, very much in
shape like the blade of a sword, the rest of the sky very serene and
clear.What this may portend, God only knows; but such another
phenomenon I remember to have seen in 1640, about the trial of the great
Earl of Strafford, preceding our bloody Rebellion.We have had of late several comets, which though I believe
appear from natural causes, and of themselves operate not, yet I cannot
despise them.They may be warnings from God, as they commonly are
forerunners of his animadversions.After many days and nights of snow,
cloudy and dark weather, the comet was very much wasted.My daughter-in-law was brought to bed of a son,
christened Richard.A solemn public Fast that God would prevent all
Popish plots, avert his judgments, and give a blessing to the
proceedings of Parliament now assembled, and which struck at the
succession of the Duke of York.The Viscount Stafford was beheaded on Towerhill.I was at the wedding of my nephew, John Evelyn
of Wotton, married by the Bishop of Rochester at Westminster, in Henry
VII.'s chapel, to the daughter and heir of Mr.Eversfield, of Sussex,
her portion L8,000.The solemnity was kept with a few friends only at
Lady Beckford's, the lady's mother.Visited and dined at the Earl of Essex's, with whom I
spent most of the afternoon alone.Thence to my (yet living) godmother
and kinswoman, Mrs.Keightley, sister to Sir Thomas Evelyn and niece to
my father, being now eighty-six years of age, sprightly, and in perfect
health, her eyes serving her as well as ever, and of a comely
countenance, that one would not suppose her above fifty.Great
expectation of his Royal Highness's case as to the succession, against
which the House was set.An extraordinary sharp, cold spring, not yet a leaf on the trees, frost
and snow lying: while the whole nation was in the greatest ferment.Asaph) at
his house in Leicester Fields, now going to reside in his diocese.Brisbane's, Secretary to the Admiralty,

26th April, 1681.I dined at Don Pietro Ronquillo's, the Spanish
Ambassador, at Wild House, who used me with extraordinary civility.The
dinner was plentiful, half after the Spanish, half after the English
way.After dinner, he led me into his bedchamber, where we fell into a
long discourse concerning religion.Though he was a learned man in
politics, and an advocate, he was very ignorant in religion, and unable
to defend any point of controversy; he was, however, far from being
fierce.At parting, he earnestly wished me to apply humbly to the
blessed virgin to direct me, assuring me that he had known divers who
had been averse from the Roman Catholic religion, wonderfully
enlightened and convinced by her intercession.He importuned me to come
and visit him often.Came to dine with me Sir William Fermor, of
Northamptonshire, and Sir Christopher Wren, his Majesty's architect and
surveyor, now building the Cathedral of St.Paul, and the column in
memory of the city's conflagration, and was in hand with the building of
fifty parish churches.Came my Lady Sunderland, to desire that I would propose
a match to Sir Stephen Fox for her son, Lord Spencer, to marry Mrs.I excused myself all I was able; for the
truth is, I was afraid he would prove an extravagant man: for, though a
youth of extraordinary parts, and had an excellent education to render
him a worthy man, yet his early inclinations to extravagance made me
apprehensive, that I should not serve Sir Stephen by proposing it, like
a friend; this being now his only daughter, well-bred, and likely to
receive a large share of her father's opulence.Lord Sunderland was much
sunk in his estate by gaming and other prodigalities, and was now no
longer Secretary of State, having fallen into displeasure of the King
for siding with the Commons about the succession; but which, I am
assured, he did not do out of his own inclination, or for the
preservation of the Protestant religion, but by mistaking the ability of
the party to carry it.However, so earnest and importunate was the
Countess, that I did mention it to Sir Stephen, who said it was too
great an honor, that his daughter was very young, as well as my Lord,
and he was resolved never to marry her without the parties' mutual
liking; with other objections which I neither would or could contradict.He desired me to express to the Countess the great sense he had of the
honor done him, that his daughter and her son were too young, that he
would do nothing without her liking, which he did not think her capable
of expressing judiciously, till she was sixteen or seventeen years of
age, of which she now wanted four years, and that I would put it off as
civilly as I could.Our new curate preached, a pretty hopeful young man, yet
somewhat raw, newly come from college, full of Latin sentences, which in
time will wear off.There came to visit me Sir William Walter and Sir John
Elowes: and the next day, the Earl of Kildare, a young gentleman related
to my wife, and other company.There had scarce fallen any rain since
Christmas.I went to Hampton Court, when the Surrey gentlemen
presented their addresses to his Majesty, whose hand I kissed,
introduced by the Duke of Albemarle.Being at the Privy Council, I took
another occasion of discoursing with Sir Stephen Fox about his daughter
and to revive that business, and at least brought it to this: That in
case the young people liked one the other, after four years, he first
desiring to see a particular of my Lord's present estate if I could
transmit it to him privately, he would make her portion L14,000, though
to all appearance he might likely make it L50,000 as easily, his eldest
son having no child and growing very corpulent.It still continued so great a drought as had never been
known in England, and it was said to be universal.No sermon this afternoon, which I think did not
happen twice in this parish these thirty years; so gracious has God been
to it, and indeed to the whole nation: God grant that we abuse not this
great privilege either by our wantonness, schism, or unfaithfulness,
under such means as he has not favored any other nation under Heaven
besides![Sidenote: WOTTON]

23d August, 1681.I went to Wotton, and, on the following day, was
invited to Mr.Denzil Onslow's at his seat at Purford, where was much
company, and such an extraordinary feast, as I had hardly seen at any
country gentleman's table.What made it more remarkable was, that there
was not anything save what his estate about it did afford; as venison,
rabbits, hares, pheasants, partridges, pigeons, quails, poultry, all
sorts of fowl in season from his own decoy near his house, and all sorts
of fresh fish.After dinner we went to see sport at the decoy, where I
never saw so many herons.The seat stands on a flat, the ground pasture, rarely watered, and
exceedingly improved since Mr.Onslow bought it of Sir Robert Parkhurst,
who spent a fair estate.The house is timber, but commodious, and with
one ample dining-room, the hall adorned with paintings of fowl and
huntings, etc., the work of Mr.Barlow, who is excellent in this kind
from the life.Hussey (at Sutton in
Shere), who has a very pretty seat well watered, near my brother's.He
is the neatest husband for curious ordering his domestic and field
accommodations, and what pertains to husbandry, that I have ever seen,
as to his granaries, tacklings, tools, and utensils, plows, carts,
stables, wood piles, wood houses, even to hen roosts and hog troughs.Methought, I saw old Cato, or Varro, in him; all substantial, all in
exact order.The sole inconvenience he lies under, is the great quantity
of sand which the stream brings along with it, and fills his canals and
receptacles for fish too soon.The rest of my time of stay at Wotton was
spent in walking about the grounds and goodly woods, where I have in my
youth so often entertained my solitude; and so, on the 2d of September,
I once more returned to my home.Died my pretty grandchild, and was interred on the
8th [at Deptford].Dined with Sir Stephen Fox, who proposed to me the
purchasing of Chelsea College, which his Majesty had sometime since
given to our Society, and would now purchase it again to build a
hospital; or infirmary for soldiers there, in which he desired my
assistance as one of the Council of the Royal Society.I had another opportunity of visiting his
Majesty's private library at Whitehall.To Sir Samuel Morland's, to see his house and mechanics.I went with Monsieur Faubert about taking the
Countess of Bristol's house for an academy, he being lately come from
Paris for his religion, and resolving to settle here.I went to see Sir Thomas Bond's fine house and
garden at Peckham.I went to Camberwell, where that good man Dr.Parr
(late chaplain to Archbishop Usher) preached on Acts xvi.To Fulham, to visit the Bishop of London, in whose
garden I first saw the _Sedum arborescens_ in flower, which was
exceedingly beautiful.16, 17, before the
King, of the usurpation of the Church of Rome.This is one of the first
rank of pulpit men in the nation.I dined with the Earl of Essex who, after dinner
in his study, where we were alone, related to me how much he had been
scandalized and injured in the report of his being privy to the marriage
of his Lady's niece, the rich young widow of the late Lord Ogle, sole
daughter of the Earl of Northumberland; showing me a letter of Mr.Thynn's, excusing himself for not communicating his marriage to his
Lordship.He acquainted me also with the whole story of that unfortunate
lady being betrayed by her grandmother, the Countess of Northumberland,
and Colonel Bret, for money; and that though, upon the importunity of
the Duke of Monmouth, he had delivered to the grandmother a particular
of the jointure which Mr.Thynn pretended he would settle on the lady,
yet he totally discouraged the proceeding as by no means a competent
match for one that both by birth and fortune might have pretended to the
greatest prince in Christendom; that he also proposed the Earl of
Kingston, or the Lord Cranburn, but was by no means for Mr.[Sidenote: LONDON]

19th November, 1681.I dined with my worthy friend, Mr.Erskine, Master
of the Charter House, uncle to the Duchess of Monmouth; a wise and
learned gentleman, fitter to have been a privy councillor and minister
of state than to have been laid aside.I was at the audience of the Russian Ambassador
before both their Majesties in the Banqueting House.The presents were
carried before him, held up by his followers in two ranks before the
King's State, and consisted of tapestry (one suite of which was
doubtlessly brought from France as being of that fabric, the Ambassador
having passed through that kingdom as he came out of Spain), a large
Persian carpet, furs of sable and ermine, etc.; but nothing was so
splendid and exotic as the Ambassador who came soon after the King's
restoration.This present Ambassador was exceedingly offended that his
coach was not permitted to come into the Court, till, being told that no
King's Ambassador did, he was pacified, yet requiring an attestation of
it under the hand of Sir Charles Cotterell, the Master of the
Ceremonies; being, it seems, afraid he should offend his Master, if he
omitted the least punctilio.It was reported he condemned his son to
lose his head for shaving off his beard, and putting himself in the
French mode at Paris, and that he would have executed it, had not the
French King interceded--but qy.Sir Christopher Wren chosen President [of the Royal
Society], Mr.Plot, the ingenious author of
the "History of Oxfordshire."I saw the audience of the Morocco Ambassador,
his retinue not numerous.He was received in the Banqueting House, both
their Majesties being present.He came up to the throne without making
any sort of reverence, not bowing his head, or body.He spoke by a
renegado Englishman, for whose safe return there was a promise.They
were all clad in the Moorish habit, cassocks of  cloth, or silk,
with buttons and loops, over this an _alhaga_, or white woolen mantle,
so large as to wrap both head and body, a sash, or small turban,
naked-legged and armed, but with leather socks like the Turks, rich
scymetar, and large calico sleeved shirts.The Ambassador had a string
of pearls oddly woven in his turban.I fancy the old Roman habit was
little different as to the mantle and naked limbs.He was a handsome
person, well featured, of a wise look, subtle, and extremely civil.Their presents were lions and ostriches; their errand about a peace at
Tangier.But the concourse and tumult of the people was intolerable, so
as the officers could keep no order, which these strangers were
astonished at first, there being nothing so regular, exact, and
performed with such silence, as is on all these public occasions of
their country, and indeed over all the Turkish dominions.Dined at the Bishop of Rochester's, at the Abbey, it
being his marriage day, after twenty-four years.He related to me how he
had been treated by Sir William Temple, foreseeing that he might be a
delegate in the concern of my Lady Ogle now likely come in controversy
upon her marriage with Mr.Thynn; also how earnestly the late Earl of
Danby, Lord Treasurer, sought his friendship, and what plain and sincere
advice he gave him from time to time about his miscarriages and
partialities; particularly his outing Sir John Duncomb from being
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Sir Stephen Fox, above all, from being
Paymaster of the Army.The Treasurer's excuse and reason was, that Fox's
credit was so over great with the bankers and monied men, that he could
procure none but by his means, "for that reason," replied the Bishop, "I
would have made him my friend, Sir Stephen being a person both honest
and of credit."He told him likewise of his stateliness and difficulty
of access, and several other miscarriages, and which indeed made him
hated.To the Royal Society, where at the Council we
passed a new law for the more accurate consideration of candidates, as
whether they would really be useful; also concerning the honorary
members, that none should be admitted but by diploma.[Sidenote: LONDON]

This evening I was at the entertainment of the Morocco Ambassador at the
Duchess of Portsmouth's glorious apartments at Whitehall, where was a
great banquet of sweetmeats and music; but at which both the Ambassador
and his retinue behaved themselves with extraordinary moderation and
modesty, though placed about a long table, a lady between two Moors, and
among these were the King's natural children, namely, Lady Lichfield and
Sussex, the Duchess of Portsmouth, Nelly, etc., concubines, and cattle
of that sort, as splendid as jewels and excess of bravery could make
them; the Moors neither admiring nor seeming to regard anything,
furniture or the like, with any earnestness, and but decently tasting of
the banquet.They drank a little milk and water, but not a drop of wine;
they also drank of a sorbet and jacolatt;[45] did not look about, or
stare on the ladies, or express the least surprise, but with a courtly
negligence in pace, countenance, and whole behavior, answering only to
such questions as were asked with a great deal of wit and gallantry, and
so gravely took leave with this compliment, that God would bless the
Duchess of Portsmouth and the Prince, her son meaning the little Duke of
Richmond.The King came in at the latter end, just as the Ambassador was
going away.In this manner was this slave (for he was no more at home)
entertained by most of the nobility in town, and went often to Hyde Park
on horseback, where he and his retinue showed their extraordinary
activity in horsemanship, and flinging and catching their lances at full
speed; they rode very short, and could stand upright at full speed,
managing their spears with incredible agility.He went sometimes to the
theaters, where, upon any foolish or fantastical action, he could not
forbear laughing, but he endeavored to hide it with extraordinary
modesty and gravity.In a word, the Russian Ambassador, still at Court
behaved himself like a clown compared to this civil heathen.This evening, Sir Stephen Fox acquainted me again
with his Majesty's resolution of proceeding in the erection of a Royal
Hospital for emerited soldiers on that spot of ground which the Royal
Society had sold to his Majesty for L1,300, and that he would settle
L5,000 per annum on it, and build to the value of L20,000 for the relief
and reception of four companies, namely, 400 men, to be as in a college,
or monastery.I was therefore desired by Sir Stephen (who had not only
the whole managing of this, but was, as I perceived, himself to be a
grand benefactor, as well it became him who had gotten so vast an estate
by the soldiers) to assist him, and consult what method to cast it in,
as to the government.So, in his study we arranged the governor,
chaplain, steward, housekeeper, chirurgeon, cook, butler, gardener,
porter, and other officers, with their several salaries and
entertainments.I would needs have a library, and mentioned several
books, since some soldiers might possibly be studious, when they were at
leisure to recollect.Thus we made the first calculations, and set down
our thoughts to be considered and digested better, to show his Majesty
and the Archbishop.He also engaged me to consider of what laws and
orders were fit for the government, which was to be in every respect as
strict as in any religious convent.After supper, came in the famous treble, Mr.Abel, newly returned from
Italy; I never heard a more excellent voice; one would have sworn it had
been a woman's, it was so high, and so well and skillfully managed,
being accompanied by Signor Francesco on the harpsichord.Pepys, late Secretary to the Admiralty, showed
me a large folio containing the whole mechanic part and art of building
royal ships and men-of-war, made by Sir Anthony Dean, being so accurate
a piece from the very keel to the lead block, rigging, guns, victualing,
manning, and even to every individual pin and nail, in a method so
astonishing and curious, with a draught, both geometrical and in
perspective, and several sections, that I do not think the world can
show the like.My daughter, Mary, began to learn music of Signor
Bartholomeo, and dancing of Monsieur Isaac, reputed the best masters.Having had several violent fits of an ague, recourse was had to bathing
my legs in milk up to the knees, made as hot as I could endure it: and
sitting so in it in a deep churn, or vessel, covered with blankets, and
drinking _carduus_ posset, then going to bed and sweating, I not only
missed that expected fit, but had no more, only continued weak, that I
could not go to church till Ash Wednesday, which I had not missed, I
think, so long in twenty years, so gracious had God been to me.After this warning and admonition, I now began to look over and
methodize all my writings, accounts, letters, papers; inventoried the
goods, and other articles of the house, and put things into the best
order I could, and made my will; that now, growing in years, I might
have none of these secular things and concerns to distract me, when it
should please Almighty God to call me from this transitory life.With
this, I prepared some special meditations and devotions for the time of
sickness.The Lord Jesus grant them to be salutary for my poor soul in
that day, that I may obtain mercy and acceptance!My second grandchild was born, and christened the next
day by our vicar at Sayes Court, by the name of John.[46] I beseech God
to bless him![Footnote 46: Who became his successor, and was created a baronet in
    1713.]I went to church: our vicar preached on
Proverbs, showing what care and vigilance was required for the keeping
of the heart upright.The Holy Communion followed, on which I gave God
thanks for his gracious dealing with me in my late sickness, and
affording me this blessed opportunity of praising him in the
congregation, and receiving the cup of salvation with new and serious
resolutions.Came to see and congratulate my recovery, Sir John Lowther, Mr.Pepys, Sir Anthony Deane, and Mr.This day was executed Colonel Vrats, and some of his
accomplices, for the execrable murder of Mr.Thynn, set on by the
principal Koningsmark.He went to execution like an undaunted hero, as
one that had done a friendly office for that base coward, Count
Koningsmark, who had hopes to marry his widow, the rich Lady Ogle, and
was acquitted by a corrupt jury, and so got away.Vrats told a friend of
mine who accompanied him to the gallows, and gave him some advice that
he did not value dying of a rush, and hoped and believed God would deal
with him like a gentleman.Never man went, so unconcerned for his sad
fate.I went to see the corpse of that obstinate creature,
Colonel Vrats, the King permitting that his body should be transported
to his own country, he being of a good family, and one of the first
embalmed by a particular art, invented by one William Russell, a
coffin-maker, which preserved the body without disboweling, or to
appearance using any bituminous matter.The flesh was florid, soft, and
full, as if the person were only sleeping.He had now been dead near
fifteen days, and lay exposed in a very rich coffin lined with lead, too
magnificent for so daring and horrid a murderer.[Sidenote: LONDON]

At the meeting of the Royal Society were exhibited some pieces of amber
sent by the Duke of Brandenburg, in one of which was a spider, in
another a gnat, both very entire.There was a discourse of the tingeing
of glass, especially with red, and the difficulty of finding any red
color effectual to penetrate glass, among the glass-painters; that the
most diaporous, as blue, yellow, etc., did not enter into the substance
of what was ordinarily painted, more than very shallow, unless
incorporated in the metal itself, other reds and whites not at all
beyond the superfices.To the Royal Society, where at a Council was regulated
what collections should be published monthly, as formerly the
transactions, which had of late been discontinued, but were now much
called for by the curious abroad and at home.I went this afternoon with several of the Royal
Society to a supper which was all dressed, both fish and flesh, in
Monsieur Papin's digestors, by which the hardest bones of beef itself,
and mutton, were made as soft as cheese, without water or other liquor,
and with less than eight ounces of coals, producing an incredible
quantity of gravy; and for close of all, a jelly made of the bones of
beef, the best for clearness and good relish, and the most delicious
that I had ever seen, or tasted.We ate pike and other fish, bones and
all, without impediment; but nothing exceeded the pigeons, which tasted
just as if baked in a pie, all these being stewed in their own juice,
without any addition of water save what swam about the digestor, as _in
balneo_; the natural juice of all these provisions acting on the grosser
substances, reduced the hardest bones to tenderness; but it is best
descanted with more particulars for extracting tinctures, preserving and
stewing fruit, and saving fuel, in Dr.Papin's book, published and
dedicated to our Society of which he is a member.He is since gone to
Venice with the late Resident here (and also a member of our Society),
who carried this excellent mechanic, philosopher, and physician, to set
up a philosophical meeting in that city.This philosophical supper
caused much mirth among us, and exceedingly pleased all the company.I
sent a glass of the jelly to my wife, to the reproach of all that the
ladies ever made of their best hartshorn.[47]

    possessed so remarkable a knowledge of mathematics, that he very
    nearly brought the invention of the steam engine into working order.Boyle in his pneumatic experiments, and was
    afterward mathematical professor at Marburg.The season was unusually wet, with rain and thunder.I was desired by Sir Stephen Fox and Sir Christopher
Wren to accompany them to Lambeth, with the plot and design of the
college to be built at Chelsea, to have the Archbishop's approbation.It
was a quadrangle of 200 feet square, after the dimensions of the larger
quadrangle at Christ church, Oxford, for the accommodation of 440
persons, with governor and officers.The Duke and Duchess of York were just now come to London, after his
escape and shipwreck, as he went by sea for Scotland.At the Rolls' chapel preached the famous Dr.10, describing excellently well what was meant by election;
viz, not the effect of any irreversible decree, but so called because
they embraced the Gospel readily, by which they became elect, or
precious to God.It would be very needless to make our calling and
election sure, were they irreversible and what the rigid Presbyterians
pretend.Lawrence's church, a new and cheerful
pile.I gave notice to the Bishop of Rochester of what
Maimburg had published about the motives of the late Duchess of York's
perversion, in his "History of Calvinism;" and did myself write to the
Bishop of Winchester about it, who being concerned in it, I urged him to
set forth his vindication.The Morocco Ambassador being admitted an honorary member
of the Royal Society, and subscribing his name and titles in Arabic, I
was deputed by the Council to go and compliment him.The Bantam, or East India Ambassadors (at this time we
had in London the Russian, Moroccan, and Indian Ambassadors), being
invited to dine at Lord George Berkeley's (now Earl), I went to the
entertainment to contemplate the exotic guests.They were both very
hard-favored, and much resembling in countenance some sort of monkeys.We ate at two tables, the Ambassadors and interpreter by themselves.Their garments were rich Indian silks, flowered with gold, viz, a close
waistcoat to their knees, drawers, naked legs, and on their heads caps
made like fruit baskets.They wore poisoned daggers at their bosoms, the
hafts carved with some ugly serpents' or devils' heads, exceedingly
keen, and of Damascus metal.The second Ambassador
(sent it seems to succeed in case the first should die by the way in so
tedious a journey), having been at Mecca, wore a Turkish or Arab sash, a
little part of the linen hanging down behind his neck, with some other
difference of habit, and was half a <DW64>, bare legged and naked feet,
and deemed a very holy man.They sat cross-legged like Turks, and
sometimes in the posture of apes and monkeys; their nails and teeth as
black as jet, and shining, which being the effect, as to their teeth, of
perpetually chewing betel to preserve them from the toothache, much
raging in their country, is esteemed beautiful.The first ambassador was of an olive hue, a flat face, narrow eyes,
squat nose, and Moorish lips, no hair appeared; they wore several rings
of silver, gold and copper on their fingers, which was a token of
knighthood, or nobility.They were of Java Major, whose princes have
been turned Mahometans not above fifty years since; the inhabitants are
still pagans and idolaters.They seemed of a dull and heavy
constitution, not wondering at any thing they saw; but exceedingly
astonished how our law gave us propriety in our estates, and so thinking
we were all kings, for they could not be made to comprehend how subjects
could possess anything but at the pleasure of their Prince, they being
all slaves; they were pleased with the notion, and admired our
happiness.They were very sober, and I believe subtle in their way.Their meat was cooked, carried up, and they attended by several fat
slaves, who had no covering save drawers, which appeared very uncouth
and loathsome.They ate their pilaw, and other spoon-meat, without
spoons, taking up their pottage in the hollow of their fingers, and very
dexterously flung it into their mouths without spilling a drop.Came to dine with me, the Duke of Grafton and the young
Earl of Ossory, son to my most dear deceased friend.Went to visit our good neighbor, Mr.Bohun, whose whole
house is a cabinet of all elegancies, especially Indian; in the hall are
contrivances of Japan screens, instead of wainscot; and there is an
excellent pendule clock inclosed in the curious flowerwork of Mr.Gibbons, in the middle of the vestibule.The landscapes of the screens
represent the manner of living, and country of the Chinese.But, above
all, his lady's cabinet is adorned on the fret, ceiling, and
chimney-piece, with Mr.There are also some of
Streeter's best paintings, and many rich curiosities of gold and silver
as growing in the mines.The gardens are exactly kept, and the whole
place very agreeable and well watered.The owners are good neighbors,
and Mr.Bohun has also built and endowed a hospital for eight poor
people, with a pretty chapel, and every necessary accommodation.To the Bishop of London at Fulham, to review the
additions which Mr.Marshall had made to his curious book of flowers in
miniature, and collection of insects.With Sir Stephen Fox, to survey the foundations of the
Royal Hospital begun at Chelsea.[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th August, 1682.The Council of the Royal Society had it recommended
to them to be trustees and visitors, or supervisors, of the Academy
which Monsieur Faubert did hope to procure to be built by subscription
of worthy gentlemen and noblemen, for the education of youth, and to
lessen the vast expense the nation is at yearly by sending children into
France to be taught military exercises.We thought to give him all the
encouragement our recommendation could procure.Rogers, an acquaintance of mine
long since at Padua.He was then Consul of the English nation, and
student in that University, where he proceeded Doctor in Physic;
presenting me now with the Latin oration he lately made upon the famous
Dr.Harvey's anniversary in the College of Physicians, at London.This night I saw another comet, near Cancer, very
bright, but the stream not so long as the former.Supped at Lord Clarendon's, with Lord Hyde, his
brother, now the great favorite, who invited himself to dine at my house
the Tuesday following.Being my birthday, and I now entering my great
climacterical of 63, after serious recollections of the years past,
giving Almighty God thanks for all his merciful preservations and
forbearance, begging pardon for my sins and unworthiness, and his
blessing on me the year entering, I went with my Lady Fox to survey her
building, and give some directions for the garden at Chiswick; the
architect is Mr.May,--somewhat heavy and thick, and not so well
understood: the garden much too narrow, the place without water, near a
highway, and near another great house of my Lord Burlington, little land
about it, so that I wonder at the expense; but women will have their
will.I was invited to dine with Monsieur Lionberg, the
Swedish Resident, who made a magnificent entertainment, it being the
birthday of his King.There dined the Duke of Albemarle, Duke of
Hamilton, Earl of Bath, Earl of Aylesbury, Lord Arran, Lord Castlehaven,
the son of him who was executed fifty years before, and several great
persons.I was exceedingly afraid of drinking (it being a Dutch feast),
but the Duke of Albemarle being that night to wait on his Majesty,
excess was prohibited; and, to prevent all, I stole away and left the
company as soon as we rose from table.[Sidenote: LONDON]

28th November, 1682.I went to the Council of the Royal Society, for the
auditing the last year's account, where I was surprised with a fainting
fit that for a time took away my sight; but God being merciful to me, I
recovered it after a short repose.I was exceedingly endangered and importuned to
stand the election,[48] having so many voices, but by favor of my
friends, and regard of my remote dwelling, and now frequent infirmities,
I desired their suffrages might be transferred to Sir John Hoskins, one
of the Masters of Chancery; a most learned virtuoso as well as lawyer,
who accordingly was elected.[Footnote 48: For President of the Royal Society.]Went to congratulate Lord Hyde (the great favorite)
newly made Earl of Rochester, and lately marrying his eldest daughter to
the Earl of Ossory.I sold my East India adventure of L250 principal
for L750 to the Royal Society, after I had been in that company
twenty-five years, being extraordinarily advantageous, by the blessing
of God.Sir Francis North, son to the Lord North, and Lord
Chief Justice, being made Lord Keeper on the death of the Earl of
Nottingham, the Lord Chancellor, I went to congratulate him.He is a
most knowing, learned, and ingenious man, and, besides being an
excellent person, of an ingenious and sweet disposition, very skillful
in music, painting, the new philosophy, and politer studies.Supped at Sir Joseph Williamson's, where was a
select company of our Society, Sir William Petty, Dr.Gale (that learned
schoolmaster of St.The
conversation was philosophical and cheerful, on divers considerable
questions proposed; as of the hereditary succession of the Roman
Emperors; the Pica mentioned in the preface to our Common Prayer, which
signifies only the Greek _Kalendarium_.James's, when I saw the sea
charts of Captain Collins, which that industrious man now brought to
show the Duke, having taken all the coasting from the mouth of the
Thames, as far as Wales, and exactly measuring every creek, island,
rock, soundings, harbors, sands, and tides, intending next spring to
proceed till he had finished the whole island, and that measured by
chains and other instruments: a most exact and useful undertaking.He
affirmed, that of all the maps put out since, there are none extant so
true as those of Joseph Norden, who gave us the first in Queen
Elizabeth's time; all since him are erroneous.This morning I received the news of the death of my
father-in-law, Sir Richard Browne, Knt.and Bart., who died at my house
at Sayes Court this day at ten in the morning, after he had labored
under the gout and dropsy for nearly six months, in the 78th year of his
age.The funeral was solemnized on the 19th at Deptford, with as much
decency as the dignity of the person, and our relation to him, required;
there being invited the Bishop of Rochester, several noblemen, knights,
and all the fraternity of the Trinity Company, of which he had been
Master, and others of the country.The vicar preached a short but proper
discourse on Psalm xxxix.10, on the frailty of our mortal condition,
concluding with an ample and well-deserved eulogy on the defunct,
relating to his honorable birth and ancestors, education, learning in
Greek and Latin, modern languages, travels, public employments, signal
loyalty, character abroad, and particularly the honor of supporting the
Church of England in its public worship during its persecution by the
late rebels' usurpation and regicide, by the suffrages of divers
Bishops, Doctors of the Church, and others, who found such an asylum in
his house and family at Paris, that in their disputes with the <DW7>s
(then triumphing over it as utterly lost) they used to argue for its
visibility and existence from Sir R. Browne's chapel and assembly there.Then he spoke of his great and loyal sufferings during thirteen years'
exile with his present Majesty, his return with him in the signal year
1660; his honorable employment at home, his timely recess to recollect
himself, his great age, infirmities, and death.He gave to the Trinity Corporation that land in Deptford on which are
built those almshouses for twenty-four widows of emerited seamen.He was
born the famous year of the Gunpowder Treason, in 1605, and being the
last [male] of his family, left my wife, his only daughter, heir.His
grandfather, Sir Richard Browne, was the great instrument under the
great Earl of Leicester (favorite to Queen Elizabeth) in his government
of the Netherland.He was Master of the Household to King James, and
Cofferer; I think was the first who regulated the compositions through
England for the King's household, provisions, progresses,[49] etc.,
which was so high a service, and so grateful to the whole nation, that
he had acknowledgments and public thanks sent him from all the counties;
he died by the rupture of a vein in a vehement speech he made about the
compositions in a Parliament of King James.By his mother's side he was
a Gunson, Treasurer of the Navy in the reigns of Henry VIII., Queen
Mary, and Queen Elizabeth, and, as by his large pedigree appears,
related to divers of the English nobility.Thus ended this honorable
person, after so many changes and tossings to and fro, in the same house
where he was born."Lord teach us so to number our days, that we may
apply our hearts unto wisdom!"[Footnote 49: Notice was taken of this in a previous passage of the
    "Diary."The different counties were bound to supply provisions of
    various kinds, and these were collected by officers called
    purveyors, whose extortions often excited the attention of
    Parliament.]By a special clause in his will, he ordered that his body should be
buried in the churchyard under the southeast window of the chancel,
adjoining to the burying places of his ancestors, since they came out of
Essex into Sayes Court, he being much offended at the novel custom of
burying everyone within the body of the church and chancel; that being a
favor heretofore granted to martyrs and great persons; this excess of
making churches charnel houses being of ill and irreverend example, and
prejudicial to the health of the living, besides the continual
disturbance of the pavement and seats, and several other indecencies.Hall, the pious Bishop of Norwich, would also be so interred, as may
be read in his testament.I went to see Sir Josiah Child's prodigious cost in
planting walnut trees about his seat, and making fish ponds, many miles
in circuit, in Epping Forest, in a barren spot, as oftentimes these
suddenly monied men for the most part seat themselves.He from a

with Sir Thomas Millington, both learned men; Dr.W. the most facetious
man in nature, and now Censor of the college.I was here consulted where
they should build their library; it is a pity this college is built so
near Newgate Prison, and in so obscure a hole, a fault in placing most
of our public buildings and churches in the city, through the avarice of
some few men, and his Majesty not overruling it, when it was in his
power after the dreadful conflagration.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st March, 1683.Tenison preached at Whitehall on 1 Cor.12; I
esteem him to be one of the most profitable preachers in the Church of
England, being also of a most holy conversation, very learned and
ingenious.The pains he takes and care of his parish will, I fear, wear
him out, which would be an inexpressible loss.Charleton's lecture on the heart in
the Anatomy Theater at the Physicians' College.To London, in order to my passing the following week,
for the celebration of the Easter now approaching, there being in the
Holy Week so many eminent preachers officiating at the Court and other

6th April, 1683.There was in the afternoon, according to
custom, a sermon before the King, at Whitehall; Dr.Sprat preached for
the Bishop of Rochester.I was at the launching of the last of the thirty ships
ordered to be newly built by Act of Parliament, named the "Neptune," a
second rate, one of the goodliest vessels of the whole navy, built by my
kind neighbor, young Mr.Shish, his Majesty's master shipwright of this
dock.I went to Blackheath, to see the new fair, being the
first procured by the Lord Dartmouth.This was the first day, pretended
for the sale of cattle, but I think in truth to enrich the new tavern at
the bowling-green, erected by Snape, his Majesty's farrier, a man full
of projects.There appeared nothing but an innumerable assembly of
drinking people from London, peddlars, etc., and I suppose it too near
London to be of any great use to the country.March was unusually hot and dry, and all April excessively wet.I planted all the out limits of the garden and long walks with
holly.[50]

Duke of Norfolk, to ask whether he would part with any of his cartoons
and other drawings of Raphael, and the great masters; he told me if he
might sell them all together he would, but that the late Sir Peter Lely
(our famous painter) had gotten some of his best.The person who desired
me to treat for them was Vander Douse, grandson to that great scholar,
contemporary and friend of Joseph Scaliger.Came to dinner and visited me Sir Richard Anderson, of
Pendley, and his lady, with whom I went to London.On my return home from the Royal Society, I found Mr.Wilbraham, a young gentleman of Cheshire.The Lord Dartmouth was elected Master of the Trinity
House; son to George Legge, late Master of the Ordnance, and one of the
grooms of the bedchamber; a great favorite of the Duke's, an active and
understanding gentleman in sea affairs.To our Society, where we received the Count de
Zinzendorp, Ambassador from the Duke of Saxony, a fine young man; we
showed him divers experiments on the magnet, on which subject the
Society were upon.I went to Windsor, dining by the way at Chiswick, at
Sir Stephen Fox's, where I found Sir Robert Howard (that universal
pretender), and Signor Verrio, who brought his draught and designs for
the painting of the staircase of Sir Stephen's new house.That which was new at Windsor since I was last there, and was surprising
to me, was the incomparable fresco painting in St.George's Hall,
representing the legend of St.George, and triumph of the Black Prince,
and his reception by Edward III.; the volto, or roof, not totally
finished; then the Resurrection in the Chapel, where the figure of the
Ascension is, in my opinion, comparable to any paintings of the most
famous Roman masters; the Last Supper, also over the altar.I liked the
contrivance of the unseen organ behind the altar, nor less the
stupendous and beyond all description the incomparable carving of our
Gibbons, who is, without controversy, the greatest master both for
invention and rareness of work, that the world ever had in any age; nor
doubt I at all that he will prove as great a master in the statuary art.Verrio's invention is admirable, his ordnance full and flowing, antique
and heroical; his figures move; and, if the walls hold (which is the
only doubt by reason of the salts which in time and in this moist
climate prejudice), the work will preserve his name to ages.There was now the terrace brought almost round the old castle; the
grass made clean, even, and curiously turfed; the avenues to the new
park, and other walks, planted with elms and limes, and a pretty canal,
and receptacle for fowl; nor less observable and famous is the throwing
so huge a quantity of excellent water to the enormous height of the
castle, for the use of the whole house, by an extraordinary invention of
Sir Samuel Morland.I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's with the Earls of
Bath, Castlehaven, Lords Viscounts Falconberg, Falkland, Bishop of
London, the Grand Master of Malta, brother to the Duke de Vendome (a
young wild spark), and Mr.After evening prayer, I
walked in the park with my Lord Clarendon, where we fell into discourse
of the Bishop of Salisbury (Dr.Seth Ward), his subtlety, etc.Durell, late Dean of Windsor, being dead, Dr.Turner, one of the Duke's
chaplains was made dean.I visited my Lady Arlington, groom of the stole to her Majesty, who
being hardly set down to supper, word was brought her that the Queen was
going into the park to walk, it being now near eleven at night; the
alarm caused the Countess to rise in all haste, and leave her supper to
us.By this one may take an estimate of the extreme slavery and subjection
that courtiers live in, who had not time to eat and drink at their
pleasure.It put me in mind of Horace's "Mouse," and to bless God for my
own private condition.Here was Monsieur de l'Angle, the famous minister of Charenton, lately
fled from the persecution in France, concerning the deplorable condition
of the Protestants there.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th June, 1683.I was present, and saw and heard the humble submission
and petition of the Lord Mayor, sheriffs, and aldermen, on behalf of the
city of London, on the _quo warranto_ against their charter which they
delivered to his Majesty in the presence chamber.It was delivered
kneeling, and then the King and Council went into the council chamber,
the mayor and his brethren attending still in the presence chamber.After a short space they were called in, and my Lord Keeper made a
speech to them, exaggerating the disorderly and riotous behavior in the
late election, and polling for Papillon and Du Bois after the Common
hall had been formally dissolved: with other misdemeanors, libels on the
government, etc., by which they had incurred his Majesty's high
displeasure: and that but for this submission, and under such articles
as the King should require their obedience to, he would certainly enter
judgment against them, which hitherto he had suspended.The things
required were as follows: that they should neither elect mayor,
sheriffs, aldermen, recorder, common Serjeant town clerk, coroner, nor
steward of Southwark, without his Majesty's approbation; and that if
they presented any his Majesty did not like, they should proceed in
wonted manner to a second choice; if that was disapproved, his Majesty
to nominate them; and if within five days they thought good to assent to
this, all former miscarriages should be forgotten.And so they tamely
parted with their so ancient privileges after they had dined and been
treated by the King.What
the consequences will prove, time will show.Divers of the old and most
learned lawyers and judges were of opinion that they could not forfeit
their charter, but might be personally punished for their misdemeanors;
but the plurality of the younger judges and rising men judged it
otherwise.The Popish Plot also, which had hitherto made such a noise, began now
sensibly to dwindle, through the folly, knavery, impudence, and
giddiness of Oates, so as the <DW7>s began to hold up their heads
higher than ever, and those who had fled, flocked to London from abroad.Such sudden changes and eager doings there had been without anything
steady or prudent, for these last seven years.I returned to town in a coach with the Earl of
Clarendon, when passing by the glorious palace of his father, built but
a few years before, which they were now demolishing, being sold to
certain undertakers, I turned my head the contrary way till the coach
had gone past it, lest I might minister occasion of speaking of it;
which must needs have grieved him, that in so short a time their pomp
was fallen.After the Popish Plot, there was now a new and (as
they called it) a Protestant Plot discovered, that certain Lords and
others should design the assassination of the King and the Duke as they
were to come from Newmarket, with a general rising of the nation, and
especially of the city of London, disaffected to the present Government.Upon which were committed to the Tower, the Lord Russell, eldest son of
the Earl of Bedford, the Earl of Essex, Mr.Algernon Sidney, son to the
old Earl of Leicester, Mr.Trenchard, Hampden, Lord Howard of Escrick,
and others.A proclamation was issued against my Lord Grey, the Duke of
Monmouth, Sir Thomas Armstrong, and one Ferguson, who had escaped beyond
sea; of these some were said to be for killing the King, others for only
seizing on him, and persuading him to new counsels, on the pretense of
the danger of Popery, should the Duke live to succeed, who was now again
admitted to the councils and cabinet secrets.The Lords Essex and
Russell were much deplored, for believing they had any evil intention
against the King, or the Church; some thought they were cunningly drawn
in by their enemies for not approving some late counsels and management
relating to France, to Popery, to the persecution of the Dissenters,
etc.They were discovered by the Lord Howard of Escrick and some false
brethren of the club, and the design happily broken; had it taken
effect, it would, to all appearance, have exposed the Government to
unknown and dangerous events; which God avert!Was born my granddaughter at Sayes Court, and christened by the name of
Martha Maria, our Vicar officiating.I pray God bless her, and may she
choose the better part![Sidenote: LONDON]

13th July, 1683.As I was visiting Sir Thomas Yarborough and his Lady,
in Covent Garden, the astonishing news was brought to us of the Earl of
Essex having cut his throat, having been but three days a prisoner in
the Tower, and this happened on the very day and instant that Lord
Russell was on his trial, and had sentence of death.This accident
exceedingly amazed me, my Lord Essex being so well known by me to be a
person of such sober and religious deportment, so well at his ease, and
so much obliged to the King.It is certain the King and Duke were at the
Tower, and passed by his window about the same time this morning, when
my Lord asking for a razor, shut himself into a closet, and perpetrated
the horrid act.Yet it was wondered by some how it was possible he
should do it in the manner he was found, for the wound was so deep and
wide, that being cut through the gullet, windpipe, and both the
jugulars, it reached to the very vertebrae of the neck, so that the head
held to it by a very little skin as it were; the gapping too of the
razor, and cutting his own fingers, was a little strange; but more, that
having passed the jugulars he should have strength to proceed so far,
that an executioner could hardly have done more with an ax.The fatal news coming to Hicks's Hall upon the article of my Lord
Russell's trial, was said to have had no little influence on the Jury
and all the Bench to his prejudice.Others said that he had himself on
some occasions hinted that in case he should be in danger of having his
life taken from him by any public misfortune, those who thirsted for his
estate should miss of their aim; and that he should speak favorably of
that Earl of Northumberland,[51] and some others, who made away with
themselves; but these are discourses so unlike his sober and prudent
conversation that I have no inclination to credit them.What might
instigate him to this devilish act, I am not able to conjecture.My Lord
Clarendon, his brother-in-law, who was with him but the day before,
assured me he was then very cheerful, and declared it to be the effect
of his innocence and loyalty; and most believe that his Majesty had no
severe intentions against him, though he was altogether inexorable as to
Lord Russell and some of the rest.For my part, I believe the crafty and
ambitious Earl of Shaftesbury had brought them into some dislike of the
present carriage of matters at Court, not with any design of destroying
the monarchy (which Shaftesbury had in confidence and for unanswerable
reasons told me he would support to his last breath, as having seen and
felt the misery of being under mechanic tyranny), but perhaps of setting
up some other whom he might govern, and frame to his own platonic fancy,
without much regard to the religion established under the hierarchy, for
which he had no esteem; but when he perceived those whom he had engaged
to rise, fail of his expectations, and the day past, reproaching his
accomplices that a second day for an exploit of this nature was never
successful, he gave them the slip, and got into Holland, where the fox
died, three months before these unhappy Lords and others were discovered
or suspected.Every one deplored Essex and Russell, especially the last,
as being thought to have been drawn in on pretense only of endeavoring
to rescue the King from his present councilors, and secure religion from
Popery, and the nation from arbitrary government, now so much
apprehended; while the rest of those who were fled, especially Ferguson
and his gang, had doubtless some bloody design to get up a Commonwealth,
and turn all things topsy-turvy.Of the same tragical principles is
Sydney.[Footnote 51: Henry Percy, eighth Earl of Northumberland, shot
    himself in the Tower, to which he had been committed on a charge of
    high treason in June, 1585.]I had this day much discourse with Monsieur Pontaq, son to the famous
and wise prime President of Bordeaux.This gentleman was owner of that
excellent _vignoble_ of Pontaq and O'Brien, from whence come the
choicest of our Bordeaux wines; and I think I may truly say of him, what
was not so truly said of St.Paul, that much learning had made him mad.He had studied well in philosophy, but chiefly the Rabbins, and was
exceedingly addicted to cabalistical fancies, an eternal hablador
[romancer], and half distracted by reading abundance of the extravagant
Eastern Jews.He spoke all languages, was very rich, had a handsome
person, and was well bred, about forty-five years of age.Fraser, a learned Scotch gentleman, whom
I had formerly recommended to Lord Berkeley for the instruction and
government of his son, since dead at sea.He had now been in Holland at
the sale of the learned Heinsius's library, and showed me some very rare
and curious books, and some MSS., which he had purchased to good value.There were three or four Herbals in miniature, accurately done, divers
Roman antiquities of Verona, and very many books of Aldus's impression.A stranger, an old man, preached on Jerem.8, the
not hearkening to instruction, portentous of desolation to a people;
much after Bishop Andrew's method, full of logical divisions, in short
and broken periods, and Latin sentences, now quite out of fashion in the
pulpit, which is grown into a far more profitable way, of plain and
practical discourses, of which sort this nation, or any other, never had
greater plenty or more profitable (I am confident); so much has it to
answer for thriving no better on it.The public was now in great consternation on the late plot and
conspiracy; his Majesty very melancholy, and not stirring without double
guards; all the avenues and private doors about Whitehall and the Park
shut up, few admitted to walk in it.The <DW7>s, in the meantime, very
jocund; and indeed with reason, seeing their own plot brought to
nothing, and turned to ridicule, and now a conspiracy of Protestants, as
they called them.The Turks were likewise in hostility against the German Emperor, almost
masters of the Upper Hungary, and drawing toward Vienna.On the other
side, the French King (who it is believed brought in the infidels)
disturbing his Spanish and Dutch neighbors, having swallowed up almost
all Flanders, pursuing his ambition of a fifth universal monarchy; and
all this blood and disorder in Christendom had evidently its rise from
our defections at home, in a wanton peace, minding nothing but luxury,
ambition, and to procure money for our vices.To this add our irreligion
and atheism, great ingratitude, and self-interest; the apostacy of some,
and the suffering the French to grow so great, and the Hollanders so
weak.In a word, we were wanton, mad, and surfeiting with prosperity;
every moment unsettling the old foundations, and never constant to
anything.The Lord in mercy avert the sad omen, and that we do not
provoke him till he bear it no longer!This summer did we suffer twenty French men-of-war to pass our Channel
toward the Sound, to help the Danes against the Swedes, who had
abandoned the French interest, we not having ready sufficient to guard
our coasts, or take cognizance of what they did; though the nation never
had more, or a better navy, yet the sea had never so slender a fleet.George, Prince of Denmark, who had landed this day,
came to marry the Lady Anne, daughter to the Duke; so I returned home,
having seen the young gallant at dinner at Whitehall.Several of the conspirators of the lower form were
executed at Tyburn; and the next day,

[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st July, 1683.Lord Russell was beheaded in Lincoln's Inn Fields, the
executioner giving him three butcherly strokes.The speech he made, and
the paper which he gave the Sheriff declaring his innocence, the
nobleness of the family, the piety and worthiness of the unhappy
gentleman, wrought much pity, and occasioned various discourses on the
plot.I again saw Prince George of Denmark: he had the Danish
countenance, blonde, of few words, spoke French but ill, seemed somewhat
heavy, but reported to be valiant, and indeed he had bravely rescued and
brought off his brother, the King of Denmark, in a battle against the
Swedes, when both these Kings were engaged very smartly.He was married to the Lady Anne at Whitehall.Her Court
and household to be modeled as the Duke's, her father, had been, and
they to continue in England.Flamsted, the famous astronomer,
from his Observatory at Greenwich, to draw the meridian from my pendule,
etc.The Countesses of Bristol and Sunderland, aunt and
cousin-german of the late Lord Russell, came to visit me, and condole
his sad fate.The next day, came Colonel Russell, uncle to the late Lord
Russell, and brother to the Earl of Bedford, and with him Mrs.Middleton, that famous and indeed incomparable beauty, daughter to my
relation, Sir Robert Needham.I went to Bromley to visit our Bishop, and excellent
neighbor, and to congratulate his now being made Archbishop of York.On
the 28th, he came to take his leave of us, now preparing for his journey
and residence in his province.My sweet little grandchild, Martha Maria, died, and
on the 29th was buried in the parish church.This morning, was read in the church, after the
office was done, the Declaration setting forth the late conspiracy
against the King's person.I went to see what had been done by the Duke of
Beaufort on his lately purchased house at Chelsea, which I once had the
selling of for the Countess of Bristol, he had made great alterations,
but might have built a better house with the materials and the cost he
had been at.Saw the Countess of Monte Feltre, whose husband I had formerly known,
he was a subject of the Pope's, but becoming a Protestant he resided in
England, and married into the family of the Savilles, of Yorkshire.The
Count, her late husband, was a very learned gentleman, a great
politician, and a goodly man.She was accompanied by her sister,
exceedingly skilled in painting, nor did they spare for color on their
own faces.It being the day of public thanksgiving for his
Majesty's late preservation, the former Declaration was again read, and
there was an office used, composed for the occasion.A loyal sermon was
preached on the divine right of Kings, from Psalm cxliv."Thou hast
preserved David from the peril of the sword."Came to visit me the learned anatomist, Dr.Tyson,[52] with some other Fellows of our Society.[Footnote 52: Doctor Edward Tyson, a learned physician, born at
    Clevedon, Somersetshire, in 1649, who became reader of the
    anatomical lecture in Surgeons' Hall, and physician to the hospitals
    of Bethlehem and Bridewell, which offices he held at his death, Aug.He was an ingenious writer, and has left various Essays in
    the Philosophical Transactions and Hook's Collections.He published
    also "The Anatomy of a Porpoise Dissected at Gresham College," and
    "The Anatomy of a Pigmy Compared with a Monkey, an Ape, and a Man,"
    4to., 1698-99.]At the elegant villa and garden of Mr.He showed me the zinnar tree, or platanus, and told me that since
they had planted this kind of tree about the city of Ispahan, in Persia,
the plague, which formerly much infested the place, had exceedingly
abated of its mortal effects, and rendered it very healthy.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th September, 1683.I went to London to visit the Duchess of Grafton,
now great with child, a most virtuous and beautiful lady.Dining with
her at my Lord Chamberlain's, met my Lord of St.Alban's, now grown so
blind, that he could not see to take his meat.He has lived a most easy
life, in plenty even abroad, while his Majesty was a sufferer; he has
lost immense sums at play, which yet, at about eighty years old, he
continues, having one that sits by him to name the spots on the cards.He is a prudent old
courtier, and much enriched since his Majesty's return.After dinner, I walked to survey the sad demolition of Clarendon House,
that costly and only sumptuous palace of the late Lord Chancellor Hyde,
where I have often been so cheerful with him, and sometimes so sad:
happening to make him a visit but the day before he fled from the angry
Parliament, accusing him of maladministration, and being envious at his
grandeur, who from a private lawyer came to be father-in-law to the Duke
of York, and as some would suggest, designing his Majesty's marriage
with the Infanta of Portugal, not apt to breed.To this they imputed
much of our unhappiness; and that he, being sole minister and favorite
at his Majesty's restoration, neglected to gratify the King's suffering
party, preferring those who were the cause of our troubles.But perhaps
as many of these things were injuriously laid to his charge, so he kept
the government far steadier than it has proved since.I could name some
who I think contributed greatly to his ruin,--the buffoons and the
MISSIS, to whom he was an eye-sore.It is true he was of a jolly temper,
after the old English fashion; but France had now the ascendant, and we
were become quite another nation.The Chancellor gone, and dying in
exile, the Earl his successor sold that which cost L50,000 building, to
the young Duke of Albemarle for L25,000, to pay debts which how
contracted remains yet a mystery, his son being no way a prodigal.Some
imagine the Duchess his daughter had been chargeable to him.However it
were, this stately palace is decreed to ruin, to support the prodigious
waste the Duke of Albemarle had made of his estate, since the old man
died.He sold it to the highest bidder, and it fell to certain rich
bankers and mechanics, who gave for it and the ground about it, L35,000;
they design a new town, as it were, and a most magnificent piazza
[square].It is said they have already materials toward it with what
they sold of the house alone, more worth than what they paid for it.See
the vicissitudes of earthly things!I was astonished at this demolition,
nor less at the little army of laborers and artificers leveling the
ground, laying foundations, and contriving great buildings at an expense
of L200,000, if they perfect their design.In my walks I stepped into a goldbeater's
workhouse, where he showed me the wonderful ductility of that spreading
and oily metal.He said it must be finer than the standard, such as was
old angel-gold, and that of such he had once to the value of L100
stamped with the _agnus dei_, and coined at the time of the holy war;
which had been found in a ruined wall somewhere in the North, near to
Scotland, some of which he beat into leaves, and the rest sold to the
curiosi in antiquities and medals.We had now the welcome tidings of the King of
Poland raising the siege of Vienna, which had given terror to all
Europe, and utmost reproach to the French, who it is believed brought in
the Turks for diversion, that the French King might the more easily
swallow Flanders, and pursue his unjust conquest on the empire, while we
sat unconcerned and under a deadly charm from somebody.There was this day a collection for rebuilding Newmarket, consumed by an
accidental fire, which removing his Majesty thence sooner than was
intended, put by the assassins, who were disappointed of their
rendezvous and expectation by a wonderful providence.This made the King
more earnest to render Winchester the seat of his autumnal field
diversions for the future, designing a palace there, where the ancient
castle stood; infinitely indeed preferable to Newmarket for prospects,
air, pleasure, and provisions.The surveyor has already begun the
foundation for a palace, estimated to cost L35,000, and his Majesty is
purchasing ground about it to make a park, etc.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th October, 1683.I went to London, on receiving a note from the
Countess of Arlington, of some considerable charge or advantage I might
obtain by applying myself to his Majesty on this signal conjuncture of
his Majesty entering up judgment against the city charter; the proposal
made me I wholly declined, not being well satisfied with these violent
transactions, and not a little sorry that his Majesty was so often put
upon things of this nature against so great a city, the consequence
whereof may be so much to his prejudice; so I returned home.At this
time, the Lord Chief-Justice Pemberton was displaced.He was held to be
the most learned of the judges, and an honest man.Sir George Jeffreys
was advanced, reputed to be most ignorant, but most daring.Sir George
Treby, Recorder of London, was also put by, and one Genner, an obscure
lawyer, set in his place.Eight of the richest and chief aldermen were
removed and all the rest made only justices of the peace, and no more
wearing of gowns, or chains of gold; the Lord Mayor and two sheriffs
holding their places by new grants as _custodes_, at the King's
pleasure.The pomp and grandeur of the most august city in the world
thus changed face in a moment; which gave great occasion of discourse
and thoughts of hearts, what all this would end in.Prudent men were for
the old foundations.Following his Majesty this morning through the gallery, I went with the
few who attended him, into the Duchess of Portmouth's DRESSING ROOM
within her bedchamber, where she was in her morning loose garment, her
maids combing her, newly out of her bed, his Majesty and the gallants
standing about her; but that which engaged my curiosity, was the rich
and splendid furniture of this woman's apartment, now twice or thrice
pulled down and rebuilt to satisfy her prodigal and expensive pleasures,
while her Majesty's does not exceed some gentlemen's ladies in furniture
and accommodation.Here I saw the new fabric of French tapestry, for
design, tenderness of work, and incomparable imitation of the best
paintings, beyond anything I had ever beheld.Some pieces had
Versailles, St.Germains, and other palaces of the French King, with
huntings, figures, and landscapes, exotic fowls, and all to the life
rarely done.Then for Japan cabinets, screens, pendule clocks, great
vases of wrought plate, tables, stands, chimney-furniture, sconces,
branches, braseras, etc., all of massy silver and out of number, besides
some of her Majesty's best paintings.Surfeiting of this, I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's and went contented home
to my poor, but quiet villa.What contentment can there be in the riches
and splendor of this world, purchased with vice and dishonor?Visited the Duchess of Grafton, not yet brought to
bed, and dining with my Lord Chamberlain (her father), went with them to
see Montague House, a palace lately built by Lord Montague, who had
married the most beautiful Countess of Northumberland.It is a stately
and ample palace.Signor Verrio's fresco paintings, especially the
funeral pile of Dido, on the staircase, the labors of Hercules, fight
with the Centaurs, his effeminacy with Dejanira, and Apotheosis or
reception among the gods, on the walls and roof of the great room
above,--I think exceeds anything he has yet done, both for design,
coloring, and exuberance of invention, comparable to the greatest of the
old masters, or what they so celebrate at Rome.In the rest of the
chamber are some excellent paintings of Holbein, and other masters.The
garden is large, and in good air, but the fronts of the house not
answerable to the inside.The court at entry, and wings for offices seem
too near the street, and that so very narrow and meanly built, that the
corridor is not in proportion to the rest, to hide the court from being
overlooked by neighbors; all which might have been prevented, had they
placed the house further into the ground, of which there was enough to
spare.But on the whole it is a fine palace, built after the French
pavilion-way, by Mr.Hooke, the Curator of the Royal Society.There were
with us my Lady Scroope, the great wit, and Monsieur Chardine, the
celebrated traveler.Came to visit me my old and worthy friend, Mr.Packer, bringing with him his nephew Berkeley, grandson to the honest
judge.A most ingenious, virtuous, and religious gentleman, seated near
Worcester, and very curious in gardening.I was at the court-leet of this manor, my Lord
Arlington his Majesty's High Steward.Came to visit and dine with me, Mr.Brisbane,
Secretary to the Admiralty, a learned and agreeable man.I went to Kew to visit Sir Henry Capell, brother to
the late Earl of Essex; but he being gone to Cashiobury, after I had
seen his garden and the alterations therein, I returned home.He had
repaired his house, roofed his hall with a kind of cupola, and in a
niche was an artificial fountain; but the room seems to me
over-melancholy, yet might be much improved by having the walls well
painted _a fresco_.The two green houses for oranges and myrtles,
communicating with the rooms below, are very well contrived.There is a
cupola made with pole-work between two elms at the end of a walk, which
being covered by plashing the trees to them, is very pretty; for the
rest there are too many fir trees in the garden.[Sidenote: LONDON]

17th November, 1683.I took a house in Villiers Street, York Buildings,
for the winter, having many important concerns to dispatch, and for the
education of my daughters.The Duke of Monmouth, till now proclaimed traitor on
the pretended plot for which Lord Russell was lately beheaded, came this
evening to Whitehall and rendered himself, on which were various
discourses.I went to compliment the Duchess of Grafton, now
lying-in of her first child, a son, which she called for, that I might
see it.She was become more beautiful, if it were possible, than before,
and full of virtue and sweetness.She discoursed with me of many
particulars, with great prudence and gravity beyond her years.Forbes showed me the plot of the garden making
at Burleigh, at my Lord Exeter's, which I looked on as one of the most
noble that I had seen.The whole court and town in solemn mourning for the death of the King of
Portugal, her Majesty's brother.At the anniversary dinner of the Royal Society the
King sent us two does.I was this day invited to a wedding of one Mrs.Castle, to whom I had some obligation, and it was to her fifth husband,
a lieutenant-colonel of the city.She was the daughter of one Burton, a
broom-man, by his wife, who sold kitchen stuff in Kent Street, whom God
so blessed that the father became a very rich, and was a very honest
man; he was sheriff of Surrey, where I have sat on the bench with him.Another of his daughters was married to Sir John Bowles; and this
daughter was a jolly friendly woman.There was at the wedding the Lord
Mayor, the Sheriff, several Aldermen and persons of quality; above all,
Sir George Jeffreys, newly made Lord Chief Justice of England, with Mr.Justice Withings, danced with the bride, and were exceedingly merry.These great men spent the rest of the afternoon, till eleven at night,
in drinking healths, taking tobacco, and talking much beneath the
gravity of judges, who had but a day or two before condemned Mr.Algernon Sidney, who was executed the 7th on Tower Hill, on the single
witness of that monster of a man, Lord Howard of Escrick, and some
sheets of paper taken in Mr.Sidney's study, pretended to be written by
him, but not fully proved, nor the time when, but appearing to have been
written before his Majesty's Restoration, and then pardoned by the Act
of Oblivion; so that though Mr.Sidney was known to be a person
obstinately averse to government by a monarch (the subject of the paper
was in answer to one by Sir E. Filmer), yet it was thought he had very
hard measure.There is this yet observable, that he had been an
inveterate enemy to the last king, and in actual rebellion against him;
a man of great courage, great sense, great parts, which he showed both
at his trial and death; for, when he came on the scaffold, instead of a
speech, he told them only that he had made his peace with God, that he
came not thither to talk, but to die; put a paper into the sheriff's
hand, and another into a friend's; said one prayer as short as a grace,
laid down his neck, and bid the executioner do his office.The Duke of Monmouth, now having his pardon, refuses to acknowledge
there was any treasonable plot; for which he is banished Whitehall.This
is a great disappointment to some who had prosecuted Trenchard, Hampden,
etc., that for want of a second witness were come out of the Tower upon
their _habeas corpus_.The King had now augmented his guards with a new sort of dragoons, who
carried also grenades, and were habited after the Polish manner, with
long peaked caps, very fierce and fantastical.[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th December, 1683.I went to the Tower, and visited the Earl of Danby,
the late Lord High Treasurer, who had been imprisoned four years: he
received me with great kindness.I dined with him, and stayed till
night.We had discourse of many things, his Lady railing sufficiently at
the keeping her husband so long in prison.Here I saluted the Lord
Dumblaine's wife, who before had been married to Emerton, and about whom
there was that scandalous business before the delegates.The smallpox very prevalent and mortal; the Thames
frozen.I dined at Lord Clarendon's, where I was to meet
that ingenious and learned gentleman, Sir George Wheeler, who has
published the excellent description of Africa and Greece, and who, being
a knight of a very fair estate and young, had now newly entered into
holy orders.I went to visit Sir John Chardin, a French
gentleman, who traveled three times by land into Persia, and had made
many curious researches in his travels, of which he was now setting
forth a relation.It being in England this year one of the severest
frosts that has happened of many years, he told me the cold in Persia
was much greater, the ice of an incredible thickness; that they had
little use of iron in all that country, it being so moist (though the
air admirably clear and healthy) that oil would not preserve it from
rusting, so that they had neither clocks nor watches; some padlocks they
had for doors and boxes.Sprat, now made Dean of Westminster, preached
to the King at Whitehall, on Matt.Recollecting the passages of
the past year, I gave God thanks for his mercies, praying his blessing
for the future.The weather continuing intolerably severe, streets
of booths were set up on the Thames; the air was so very cold and thick,
as of many years there had not been the like.I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's: after dinner came a
fellow who ate live charcoal, glowingly ignited, quenching them in his
mouth, and then champing and swallowing them down.There was a dog also
which seemed to do many rational actions.I went across the Thames on the ice, now become so
thick as to bear not only streets of booths, in which they roasted meat,
and had divers shops of wares, quite across as in a town, but coaches,
carts, and horses passed over.So I went from Westminster stairs to
Lambeth, and dined with the Archbishop: where I met my Lord Bruce, Sir
George Wheeler, Colonel Cooke, and several divines.After dinner and
discourse with his Grace till evening prayers, Sir George Wheeler and I
walked over the ice from Lambeth stairs to the Horse-ferry.I visited Sir Robert Reading, where after supper we
had music, but not comparable to that which Mrs.Bridgeman made us on
the guitar with such extraordinary skill and dexterity.The Thames was filled with people and tents selling
all sorts of wares as in the city.The frost continues more and more severe, the Thames
before London was still planted with booths in formal streets, all sorts
of trades and shops furnished, and full of commodities, even to a
printing press, where the people and ladies took a fancy to have their
names printed, and the day and year set down when printed on the Thames:
this humor took so universally, that it was estimated that the printer
gained L5 a day, for printing a line only, at sixpence a name, besides
what he got by ballads, etc.Coaches plied from Westminster to the
Temple, and from several other stairs to and fro, as in the streets,
sleds, sliding with skates, a bull-baiting, horse and coach-races,
puppet-plays and interludes, cooks, tippling, and other lewd places, so
that it seemed to be a bacchanalian triumph, or carnival on the water,
while it was a severe judgment on the land, the trees not only splitting
as if the lightning struck, but men and cattle perishing in divers
places, and the very seas so locked up with ice, that no vessels could
stir out or come in.The fowls, fish, and birds, and all our exotic
plants and greens, universally perishing.Many parks of deer were
destroyed, and all sorts of fuel so dear, that there were great
contributions to preserve the poor alive.Nor was this severe weather
much less intense in most parts of Europe, even as far as Spain and the
most southern tracts.London, by reason of the excessive coldness of the
air hindering the ascent of the smoke, was so filled with the fuliginous
steam of the sea-coal, that hardly could one see across the street, and
this filling the lungs with its gross particles, exceedingly obstructed
the breast, so as one could scarcely breathe.Here was no water to be
had from the pipes and engines, nor could the brewers and divers other
tradesmen work, and every moment was full of disastrous accidents.I went to Sayes Court to see how the frost had
dealt with my garden, where I found many of the greens and rare plants
utterly destroyed.The oranges and myrtles very sick, the rosemary and
laurels dead to all appearance, but the cypress likely to endure it.It began to thaw, but froze again.My coach crossed
from Lambeth, to the Horse-ferry at Milbank, Westminster.The booths
were almost all taken down; but there was first a map or landscape cut
in copper representing all the manner of the camp, and the several
actions, sports, and pastimes thereon, in memory of so signal a frost.I dined with my Lord Keeper, [North], and walking
alone with him some time in his gallery, we had discourse of music.He
told me he had been brought up to it from a child, so as to sing his
part at first sight.Then speaking of painting, of which he was also a
great lover, and other ingenious matters, he desired me to come oftener
to him.I went this evening to visit that great and knowing
virtuoso, Monsieur Justell.The weather was set in to an absolute thaw
and rain; but the Thames still frozen.After eight weeks missing the foreign posts, there
came abundance of intelligence from abroad.[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th February, 1684.The Earl of Danby, late Lord-Treasurer, together
with the Roman Catholic Lords impeached of high treason in the Popish
Plot, had now their _habeas corpus_, and came out upon bail, after five
years' imprisonment in the Tower.Then were also tried and deeply fined
Mr.Hampden and others, for being supposed of the late plot, for which
Lord Russell and Colonel Sidney suffered; as also the person who went
about to prove that the Earl of Essex had his throat cut in the Tower by
others; likewise Mr.Johnson, the author of that famous piece called
Julian.News of the Prince of Orange having accused the
Deputies of Amsterdam of _crimen laesae Majestatis_, and being pensioners
to France.Tenison communicated to me his intention of erecting a library in
St.Martin's parish, for the public use, and desired my assistance, with
Sir Christopher Wren, about the placing and structure thereof, a worthy
and laudable design.He told me there were thirty or forty young men in
Orders in his parish, either governors to young gentlemen or chaplains
to noblemen, who being reproved by him on occasion for frequenting
taverns or coffeehouses, told him they would study or employ their time
better, if they had books.This put the pious Doctor on this design; and
indeed a great reproach it is that so great a city as London should not
have a public library becoming it.Paul's;
the west end of that church (if ever finished) would be a convenient
place.I went to Sir John Chardin, who desired my
assistance for the engraving the plates, the translation, and printing
his History of that wonderful Persian Monument near Persepolis, and
other rare antiquities, which he had caused to be drawn from the
originals in his second journey into Persia, which we now concluded
upon.Afterward, I went with Sir Christopher Wren to Dr.Daniel went to the bathroom.Tenison, where
we made the drawing and estimate of the expense of the library, to be
begun this next spring near the Mews.Great expectation of the Prince of Orange's attempts in Holland to bring
those of Amsterdam to consent to the new levies, to which we were no
friends, by a pseudo-politic adherence to the French interest.Turner, our new Bishop of
Rochester.I dined at Lady Tuke's, where I heard Dr.Walgrave
(physician to the Duke and Duchess) play excellently on the lute.Meggot, Dean of Winchester, preached an
incomparable sermon (the King being now gone to Newmarket), on Heb.15, showing and pathetically pressing the care we ought to have lest we
come short of the grace of God.Tenison
at Kensington, whither he was retired to refresh, after he had been sick
of the smallpox.Henry Godolphin, a prebend
of St.Paul's, and brother to my dear friend Sydney, on Isaiah 1v.I
dined at the Lord Keeper's, and brought him to Sir John Chardin, who
showed him his accurate drafts of his travels in Persia.There was so great a concourse of people with their
children to be touched for the Evil, that six or seven were crushed to
death by pressing at the chirurgeon's door for tickets.The weather
began to be more mild and tolerable; but there was not the least
appearance of any spring.The Bishop of Rochester preached before
the King; after which his Majesty, accompanied with three of his natural
sons, the Dukes of Northumberland, Richmond, and St.Alban (sons of
Portsmouth, Cleveland, and Nelly), went up to the altar; the three boys
entering before the King within the rails, at the right hand, and three
bishops on the left: London (who officiated), Durham, and Rochester,
with the subdean, Dr.The King, kneeling before the altar,
making his offering, the Bishops first received, and then his Majesty;
after which he retired to a canopied seat on the right hand.Note, there
was perfume burned before the office began.I had received the Sacrament
at Whitehall early with the Lords and household, the Bishop of London
officiating.Tenison preached
(recovered from the smallpox); then went again to Whitehall as above.I returned home with my family to my house at Sayes
Court, after five months' residence in London; hardly the least
appearance of any spring.A letter of mine to the Royal Society concerning the
terrible effects of the past winter being read, they desired it might be
printed in the next part of their "Transactions."[Sidenote: SURREY]

10th May, 1684.Called by the way
at Ashted, where Sir Robert Howard (Auditor of the Exchequer)
entertained me very civilly at his newly-built house, which stands in a
park on the Down, the avenue south; though down hill to the house, which
is not great, but with the outhouses very convenient.The staircase is
painted by Verrio with the story of Astrea; among other figures is the
picture of the painter himself, and not unlike him; the rest is well
done, only the columns did not at all please me; there is also Sir
Robert's own picture in an oval; the whole in _fresco_.The place has
this great defect, that there is no water but what is drawn up by horses
from a very deep well.Higham, who was ill, and died three days
after.His grandfather and father (who christened me), with himself, had
now been rectors of this parish 101 years, viz, from May, 1583.I returned to London, where I found the Commissioners of
the Admiralty abolished, and the office of Admiral restored to the Duke,
as to the disposing and ordering all sea business; but his Majesty
signed all petitions, papers, warrants, and commissions, that the Duke,
not acting as admiral by commission or office, might not incur the
penalty of the late Act against <DW7>s and Dissenters holding offices,
and refusing the oath and test.Every one was glad of this change, those
in the late Commission being utterly ignorant in their duty, to the
great damage of the Navy.The utter ruin of the Low Country was threatened by the siege of
Luxemburg, if not timely relieved, and by the obstinacy of the
Hollanders, who refused to assist the Prince of Orange, being corrupted
by the French.I received L600 of Sir Charles Bickerstaff for the fee
farm of Pilton, in Devon.Lord Dartmouth was chosen Master of the Trinity Company,
newly returned with the fleet from blowing up and demolishing Tangier.In the sermon preached on this occasion, Dr.Can observed that, in the
27th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, the casting anchor out of the
fore ship had been caviled at as betraying total ignorance: that it is
very true our seamen do not do so; but in the Mediterranean their ships
were built differently from ours, and to this day it was the practice to
do so there.Luxemburg was surrendered to the French, which makes them master of all
the Netherlands, gives them entrance into Germany, and a fair game for
universal monarchy; which that we should suffer, who only and easily
might have hindered, astonished all the world.Thus is the poor Prince
of Orange ruined, and this nation and all the Protestant interest in
Europe following, unless God in his infinite mercy, as by a miracle,
interpose, and our great ones alter their counsels.The French fleet
were now besieging Genoa, but after burning much of that beautiful city
with their bombs, went off with disgrace.My cousin, Verney, to whom a very great fortune was
fallen, came to take leave of us, going into the country; a very worthy
and virtuous young gentleman.I went to advise and give directions about the building
of two streets in Berkeley Garden, reserving the house and as much of
the garden as the breadth of the house.In the meantime, I could not but
deplore that sweet place (by far the most noble gardens, courts, and
accommodations, stately porticos, etc., anywhere about the town) should
be so much straitened and turned into tenements.But that magnificent
pile and gardens contiguous to it, built by the late Lord Chancellor
Clarendon, being all demolished, and designed for piazzas and buildings,
was some excuse for my Lady Berkeley's resolution of letting out her
ground also for so excessive a price as was offered, advancing near
L1,000 per annum in mere ground rents; to such a mad intemperance was
the age come of building about a city, by far too disproportionate
already to the nation:[53] I having in my time seen it almost as large
again as it was within my memory.[Footnote 53: What would Evelyn think if he could see what is now
    called London?]Last Friday, Sir Thomas Armstrong was executed at Tyburn
for treason, without trial, having been outlawed and apprehended in
Holland, on the conspiracy of the Duke of Monmouth, Lord Russell, etc.,
which gave occasion of discourse to people and lawyers, in regard it was
on an outlawry that judgment was given and execution.[54]

    [Footnote 54: When brought up for judgment, Armstrong insisted on
    his right to a trial, the act giving that right to those who came in
    within a year, and the year not having expired.Jefferies refused
    it; and when Armstrong insisted that he asked nothing but law,
    Jefferies told him he should have it to the full, and ordered his
    execution in six days.When Jefferies went to the King at Windsor
    soon after, the King took a ring from his finger and gave it to
    Jefferies.[Sidenote: GREENWICH]

2d July, 1684.I went to the Observatory at Greenwich, where Mr.Flamsted took his observations of the eclipse of the sun, now almost
three parts obscured.There had been an excessively hot and dry spring, and such a drought
still continued as never was in my memory.Some small sprinkling of rain; the leaves dropping
from the trees as in autumn.I dined at Lord Falkland's, Treasurer of the Navy,
where after dinner we had rare music, there being among others, Signor
Pietro Reggio, and Signor John Baptist, both famous, one for his voice,
the other for playing on the harpsichord, few if any in Europe exceeding
him.There was also a Frenchman who sung an admirable bass.I returned home, where I found my Lord Chief Justice
[Jefferies], the Countess of Clarendon, and Lady Catherine Fitzgerald,
who dined with me.We had now rain after such a drought as no man in
England had known.We had not had above one or two
considerable showers, and those storms, these eight or nine months.Many
trees died for the want of refreshment.Sidney Godolphin was made Baron Godolphin.The King being returned from Winchester, there was
a numerous Court at Whitehall.At this time the Earl of Rochester was removed from the Treasury to the
Presidentship of the Council; Lord Godolphin was made first Commissioner
of the Treasury in his place, Lord Middleton (a Scot) made Secretary of
State, in the room of Lord Godolphin.These alterations being very
unexpected and mysterious, gave great occasion of discourse.There was now an Ambassador from the King of Siam, in the East Indies,
to his Majesty.I went with Sir William Godolphin to see the
rhinoceros, or unicorn, being the first that I suppose was ever brought
into England.She belonged to some East India merchants, and was sold
(as I remember) for above L2,000.At the same time, I went to see a
crocodile, brought from some of the West India Islands, resembling the
Egyptian crocodile.I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's with the Duke of
Northumberland.He seemed to be a young gentleman of good capacity, well
bred, civil and modest: newly come from travel, and had made his
campaign at the siege of Luxemburg.Of all his Majesty's children (of
which he had now six Dukes) this seemed the most accomplished and worth
the owning.What the
Dukes of Richmond and St.Alban's will prove, their youth does not yet
discover; they are very pretty boys.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th October, 1684.Goodman preached before the King on James ii.12, concerning the law of liberty: an excellent discourse and in good
method.He is author of "The Prodigal Son," a treatise worth reading,
and another of the old religion.I visited the Lord Chamberlain, where dined the
BLACK BARON and Monsieur Flamerin, who had so long been banished from
France for a duel.I carried Lord Clarendon through the city amid all
the squibs and bacchanalia of the Lord Mayor's show, to the Royal
Society, where he was proposed a member; and then treated him at dinner.Clement's, that prettily built and contrived church where
a young divine gave us an eloquent sermon on 1 Cor.20, inciting to
gratitude and glorifying God for the fabric of our bodies and the
dignity of our nature.A sudden change from temperate warm weather to an
excessive cold rain, frost, snow, and storm, such as had seldom been
known.This winter weather began as early and fierce as the past did
late; till about Christmas there then had been hardly any winter.Turner, now translated from Rochester to Ely
upon the death of Dr.Peter Gunning, preached before the King at
Whitehall on Romans iii.8, a very excellent sermon, vindicating the
Church of England against the pernicious doctrines of the Church of
Rome.He challenged the producing but of five clergymen who forsook our
Church and went over to that of Rome, during all the troubles and
rebellion in England, which lasted near twenty years; and this was to my
certain observation a great truth.Being the Queen's birthday, there were fireworks
on the Thames before Whitehall, with pageants of castles, forts, and
other devices of girandolas, serpents, the King and Queen's arms and
mottoes, all represented in fire, such as had not been seen here.But
the most remarkable was the several fires and skirmishes in the very
water, which actually moved a long way, burning under the water, now and
then appearing above it, giving reports like muskets and cannon, with
grenades and innumerable other devices.It is said it cost L1,500.It
was concluded with a ball, where all the young ladies and gallants
danced in the great hall.The court had not been seen so brave and rich
in apparel since his Majesty's Restoration.Fiennes, son of the Lord Say
and Seale, preached before the King on Joshua xxi.Slingsby (Master of the
Mint), to see Mr.The series of Popes
was rare, and so were several among the moderns, especially that of John
Huss's martyrdom at Constance; of the Roman Emperors, Consulars some
Greek, etc., in copper, gold, and silver; not many truly antique; a
medallion of Otho Paulus Aemilius, etc., ancient.They were held at a
price of L1,000; but not worth, I judge, above L200.I went to see the new church at St.James's,
elegantly built; the altar was especially adorned, the white marble
inclosure curiously and richly carved, the flowers and garlands about
the walls by Mr.Gibbons, in wood: a pelican with her young at her
breast; just over the altar in the carved compartment and border
environing the purple velvet fringed with I. H. S. richly embroidered,
and most noble plate, were given by Sir R. Geere, to the value (as was
said) of L200.There was no altar anywhere in England, nor has there
been any abroad, more handsomely adorned.James's Park
to see three Turkish, or Asian horses, newly brought over, and now first
shown to his Majesty.There were four, but one of them died at sea,
being three weeks coming from Hamburg.They were taken from a Bashaw at
the siege of Vienna, at the late famous raising that leaguer.I never
beheld so delicate a creature as one of them was, of somewhat a bright
bay, two white feet, a blaze; such a head, eyes, ears, neck, breast,
belly, haunches, legs, pasterns, and feet, in all regards, beautiful,
and proportioned to admiration; spirited, proud, nimble, making halt,
turning with that swiftness, and in so small a compass, as was
admirable.With all this so gentle and tractable as called to mind what
I remember Busbequius, speaks of them, to the reproach of our grooms in
Europe, who bring up their horses so churlishly, as makes most of them
retain their ill habits.They trotted like does, as if they did not feel
the ground.Five hundred guineas was demanded for the first; 300 for the
second; and 200 for the third, which was brown.All of them were
choicely shaped, but the two last not altogether so perfect as the
first.It was judged by the spectators, among whom was the King, Prince of
Denmark, Duke of York, and several of the Court, noble persons skilled
in horses, especially Monsieur Faubert and his son (provost masters of
the Academy, and esteemed of the best in Europe), that there were never
seen any horses in these parts to be compared with them.Add to all
this, the furniture consisting of embroidery on the saddle, housings,
quiver, bow, arrows, scymitar, sword, mace, or battle-ax, _a la
Turcisq_; the Bashaw's velvet mantle furred with the most perfect ermine
I ever beheld; all which, ironwork in common furniture being here of
silver, curiously wrought and double gilt to an incredible value.Such
and so extraordinary was the embroidery, that I never saw anything
approaching it.The reins and headstall were of crimson silk, covered
with chains of silver gilt.There was also a Turkish royal standard of a
horse's tail, together with all sorts of other caparisons belonging to a
general's horse, by which one may estimate how gallantly and
magnificently those infidels appear in the field; for nothing could be
seen more glorious.The gentleman (a German) who rode the horse, was in
all this garb.They were shod with iron made round and closed at the
heel, with a hole in the middle about as wide as a shilling.I went with Lord Cornwallis to see the young
gallants do their exercise.Faubert having newly railed in a manage,
and fitted it for the academy.There were the Dukes of Norfolk and
Northumberland, Lord Newburgh, and a nephew of (Duras) Earl of
Feversham.The exercises were, 1, running at the ring; 2, flinging a
javelin at a Moor's head; 3, discharging a pistol at a mark; lastly
taking up a gauntlet with the point of a sword; all these performed in
full speed.The Duke of Northumberland hardly missed of succeeding in
every one, a dozen times, as I think.The Duke of Norfolk did exceeding
bravely.Lords Newburgh and Duras seemed nothing so dexterous.Here I
saw the difference of what the French call "_bel homme a cheval_," and
"_bon homme a cheval_"; the Duke of Norfolk being the first, that is
rather a fine person on a horse, the Duke of Northumberland being both
in perfection, namely, a graceful person and an excellent rider.But the
Duke of Norfolk told me he had not been at this exercise these twelve
years before.There were in the field the Prince of Denmark, and the
Lord Lansdowne, son of the Earl of Bath, who had been made a Count of
the Empire last summer for his service before Vienna.John, a worthy gentleman, on a knight
of quality, in a tavern.So
many horrid murders and duels were committed about this time as were
never before heard of in England; which gave much cause of complaint and
murmurings.It proved so sharp weather, and so long and cruel
a frost, that the Thames was frozen across, but the frost was often
dissolved, and then froze again.5, after
the Presbyterian tedious method and repetition.I dined at Lord Newport's, who had some excellent
pictures, especially that of Sir Thomas Hanmer, by Vandyke, one of the
best he ever painted; another of our English Dobson's painting; but,
above all, Christ in the Virgin's lap, by Poussin, an admirable piece;
with something of most other famous hands.I saw this
evening such a scene of profuse gaming, and the King in the midst of his
three concubines, as I have never before seen--luxurious dallying and
profaneness.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, being invited to hear
that celebrated voice of Mr.Pordage, newly come from Rome; his singing
was after the Venetian recitative, as masterly as could be, and with an
excellent voice both treble and bass; Dr.Walgrave accompanied it with
his THEORBO LUTE, on which he performed beyond imagination, and is
doubtless one of the greatest masters in Europe on that charming
instrument.Pordage is a priest, as Mr.There was in the room where we dined, and in his bedchamber, those
incomparable pieces of Columbus, a Flagellation, the Grammar school, the
Venus and Adonis of Titian; and of Vandyke's that picture of the late
Earl of Digby (father of the Countess of Sunderland), and Earl of
Bedford, Sir Kenelm Digby, and two ladies of incomparable performance;
besides that of Moses and the burning bush of Bassano, and several other
pieces of the best masters.A marble head of M. Brutus, etc.I was invited to my Lord Arundel's, of Wardour (now
newly released of his six years' confinement in the Tower on suspicion
of the plot called Oates's Plot), where after dinner the same Mr.Pordage entertained us with his voice, that excellent and stupendous
artist, Signor John Baptist, playing to it on the harpsichord.My
daughter Mary being with us, she also sang to the great satisfaction of
both the masters, and a world of people of quality present.She did so also at my Lord Rochester's the evening following, where we
had the French boy so famed for his singing, and indeed he had a
delicate voice, and had been well taught.Packer
(daughter to my old friend) sing before his Majesty and the Duke,
privately, that stupendous bass, Gosling, accompanying her, but hers was
so loud as took away much of the sweetness.Certainly never woman had a
stronger or better ear, could she possibly have governed it.She would
do rarely in a large church among the nuns.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th February, 1685.I went to London, hearing his Majesty had been the
Monday before (2d February) surprised in his bedchamber with an
apoplectic fit, so that if, by God's providence, Dr.King (that
excellent chirurgeon as well as physician) had not been accidentally
present to let him bleed (having his lancet in his pocket), his Majesty
had certainly died that moment; which might have been of direful
consequence, there being nobody else present with the King save this
Doctor and one more, as I am assured.It was a mark of the extraordinary
dexterity, resolution, and presence of mind in the Doctor, to let him
bleed in the very paroxysm, without staying the coming of other
physicians, which regularly should have been done, and for want of which
he must have a regular pardon, as they tell me.This rescued his Majesty
for the instant, but it was only a short reprieve.He still complained,
and was relapsing, often fainting, with sometimes epileptic symptoms,
till Wednesday, for which he was cupped, let bleed in both jugulars, and
both vomit and purges, which so relieved him, that on Thursday hopes of
recovery were signified in the public "Gazette," but that day about
noon, the physicians thought him feverish.This they seemed glad of, as
being more easily allayed and methodically dealt with than his former
fits; so as they prescribed the famous Jesuit's powder; but it made him
worse, and some very able doctors who were present did not think it a
fever, but the effect of his frequent bleeding and other sharp
operations used by them about his head, so that probably the powder
might stop the circulation, and renew his former fits, which now made
him very weak.Thus he passed Thursday night with great difficulty, when
complaining of a pain in his side, they drew twelve ounces more of blood
from him; this was by six in the morning on Friday, and it gave him
relief, but it did not continue, for being now in much pain, and
struggling for breath, he lay dozing, and, after some conflicts, the
physicians despairing of him, he gave up the ghost at half an hour after
eleven in the morning, being the sixth of February, 1685, in the 36th
year of his reign, and 54th of his age.Prayers were solemnly made in all the churches, especially in both the
Court Chapels, where the chaplains relieved one another every half
quarter of an hour from the time he began to be in danger till he
expired, according to the form prescribed in the Church offices.Those
who assisted his Majesty's devotions were, the Archbishop of Canterbury,
the Bishops of London, Durham, and Ely, but more especially Dr.Ken, the
Bishop of Bath and Wells.[55] It is said they exceedingly urged the
receiving Holy Sacrament, but his Majesty told them he would consider of
it, which he did so long till it was too late.Others whispered that the
Bishops and Lords, except the Earls of Bath and Feversham, being ordered
to withdraw the night before, Huddleston, the priest, had presumed to
administer the Popish offices.He gave his breeches and keys to the Duke
who was almost continually kneeling by his bedside, and in tears.He
also recommended to him the care of his natural children, all except the
Duke of Monmouth, now in Holland, and in his displeasure.He entreated
the Queen to pardon him (not without cause); who a little before had
sent a Bishop to excuse her not more frequently visiting him, in regard
of her excessive grief, and withal that his Majesty would forgive it if
at any time she had offended him.He spoke to the Duke to be kind to the
Duchess of Cleveland, and especially Portsmouth, and that Nelly might
not starve.[Footnote 55: The account given of this by Charles's brother and
    successor, is, that when the King's life was wholly despaired of,
    and it was time to prepare for another world, two Bishops came to do
    their function, who reading the prayers appointed in the Common
    Prayer Book on that occasion, when they came to the place where
    usually they exhort a sick person to make a confession of his sins,
    the Bishop of Bath and Wells, who was one of them, advertised him,
    IT WAS NOT OF OBLIGATION; and after a short exhortation, asked him
    if he was sorry for his sins?which the King saying he was, the
    Bishop pronounced the absolution, and then, asked him if he pleased
    to receive the Sacrament?to which the King made no reply; and being
    pressed by the Bishop several times, gave no other answer but that
    it was time enough, or that he would think of it.King James adds, that he stood all the while by the bedside, and
    seeing the King would not receive the Sacrament from them, and
    knowing his sentiments, he desired the company to stand a little
    from the bed, and then asked the King whether he should send for a
    priest, to which the King replied: "For God's sake, brother, do, and
    lose no time."The Duke said he would bring one to him; but none
    could be found except Father Huddleston, who had been so assistant
    in the King's escape from Worcester; he was brought up a back
    staircase, and the company were desired to withdraw, but he (the
    Duke of York) not thinking fit that he should be left alone with the
    King, desired the Earl of Bath, a Lord of the Bedchamber, and the
    Earl of Feversham, Captain of the Guard, should stay; the rest being
    gone, Father Huddleston was introduced, and administered the
    Sacrament.--"Life of James II."]Thus died King Charles II., of a vigorous and robust constitution, and
in all appearance promising a long life.He was a prince of many
virtues, and many great imperfections; debonair, easy of access, not
bloody nor cruel; his countenance fierce, his voice great, proper of
person, every motion became him; a lover of the sea, and skillful in
shipping; not affecting other studies, yet he had a laboratory, and knew
of many empirical medicines, and the easier mechanical mathematics; he
loved planting and building, and brought in a politer way of living,
which passed to luxury and intolerable expense.He had a particular
talent in telling a story, and facetious passages, of which he had
innumerable; this made some buffoons and vicious wretches too
presumptuous and familiar, not worthy the favor they abused.He took
delight in having a number of little spaniels follow him and lie in his
bedchamber, where he often suffered the bitches to puppy and give suck,
which rendered it very offensive, and indeed made the whole court nasty
and stinking.He would doubtless have been an excellent prince, had he
been less addicted to women, who made him uneasy, and always in want to
supply their immeasurable profusion, to the detriment of many indigent
persons who had signally served both him and his father.He frequently
and easily changed favorites to his great prejudice.As to other public transactions, and unhappy miscarriages, 'tis not
here I intend to number them; but certainly never had King more glorious
opportunities to have made himself, his people, and all Europe happy,
and prevented innumerable mischiefs, had not his too easy nature
resigned him to be managed by crafty men, and some abandoned and profane
wretches who corrupted his otherwise sufficient parts, disciplined as he
had been by many afflictions during his banishment, which gave him much
experience and knowledge of men and things; but those wicked creatures
took him from off all application becoming so great a King.The history
of his reign will certainly be the most wonderful for the variety of
matter and accidents, above any extant in former ages: the sad tragical
death of his father, his banishment and hardships, his miraculous
restoration, conspiracies against him, parliaments, wars, plagues,
fires, comets, revolutions abroad happening in his time, with a thousand
other particulars.He was ever kind to me, and very gracious upon all
occasions, and therefore I cannot without ingratitude but deplore his
loss, which for many respects, as well as duty, I do with all my soul.His Majesty being dead, the Duke, now King James II., went immediately
to Council, and before entering into any business, passionately
declaring his sorrow, told their Lordships, that since the succession
had fallen to him, he would endeavor to follow the example of his
predecessor in his clemency and tenderness to his people; that, however
he had been misrepresented as affecting arbitrary power, they should
find the contrary; for that the laws of England had made the King as
great a monarch as he could desire; that he would endeavor to maintain
the Government both in Church and State, as by law established, its
principles being so firm for monarchy, and the members of it showing
themselves so good and loyal subjects;[56] and that, as he would never
depart from the just rights and prerogatives of the Crown, so he would
never invade any man's property; but as he had often adventured his life
in defense of the nation, so he would still proceed, and preserve it in
all its lawful rights and liberties.[Footnote 56: This is the substance (and very nearly the words
    employed) of what is stated by King James II.printed in
    his life; but in that MS.For example, after speaking of the members of the Church of England
    as good and loyal subjects, the King adds, "AND THEREFORE I SHALL
    ALWAYS TAKE CARE TO DEFEND AND SUPPORT IT."James then goes on to
    say, that being desired by some present to allow copies to be taken,
    he said he had not committed it to writing; on which Mr.Finch (then
    Solicitor-General and afterward Earl of Aylesford) replied, that
    what his Majesty had said had made so deep an impression on him,
    that he believed he could repeat the very words, and if his Majesty
    would permit him, he would write them down, which the King agreeing
    to, he went to a table and wrote them down, and this being shown to
    the King, he approved of it, and it was immediately published.The
    King afterward proceeds to say: "No one can wonder that Mr.Finch
    should word the speech as strong as he could in favor of the
    Established Religion, nor that the King in such a hurry should pass
    it over without reflection; for though his Majesty intended to
    promise both security to their religion and protection to their
    persons, he was afterward convinced it had been better expressed by
    assuring them he never would endeavor to alter the Established
    Religion, than that he would endeavor to preserve it, and that he
    would rather support and defend the professors of it, than the
    religion itself; they could not expect he should make a conscience
    of supporting what in his conscience he thought erroneous: his
    engaging not to molest the professors of it, nor to deprive them or
    their successors of any spiritual dignity, revenue, or employment,
    but to suffer the ecclesiastical affairs to go on in the track they
    were in, was all they could wish or desire from a Prince of a
    different persuasion; but having once approved that way of
    expressing it which Mr.Finch had made choice of, he thought it
    necessary not to vary from it in the declarations or speeches he
    made afterward, not doubting but the world would understand it in
    the meaning he intended.----'Tis true, afterward IT WAS pretended
    he kept not up to this engagement; but had they deviated no further
    from the duty and allegience which both nature and repeated oath
    obliged them to, THAN HE DID FROM HIS WORD, they had still remained
    as happy a people as they really were during his short reign in
    England."The words printed in small
    caps in this extract are from the interlineations of the son of King
    James II.]This being the substance of what he said, the Lords desired it might be
published, as containing matter of great satisfaction to a jealous
people upon this change, which his Majesty consented to.Then were the
Council sworn, and a Proclamation ordered to be published that all
officers should continue in their stations, that there might be no
failure of public justice, till his further pleasure should be known.Then the King rose, the Lords accompanying him to his bedchamber, where,
while he reposed himself, tired indeed as he was with grief and
watching, they returned again into the Council chamber to take order for
the PROCLAIMING his Majesty, which (after some debate) they consented
should be in the very form his grandfather, King James I., was, after
the death of Queen Elizabeth; as likewise that the Lords, etc., should
proceed in their coaches through the city for the more solemnity of it.Upon this was I, and several other gentlemen waiting in the Privy
gallery, admitted into the Council chamber to be witness of what was
resolved on.Thence with the Lords, Lord Marshal and Heralds, and other
Crown officers being ready, we first went to Whitehall gate, where the
Lords stood on foot bareheaded, while the Herald proclaimed his
Majesty's title to the Imperial Crown and succession according to the
form, the trumpets and kettledrums having first sounded three times,
which ended with the people's acclamations.Then a herald called the
Lords' coaches according to rank, myself accompanying the solemnity in
my Lord Cornwallis's coach, first to Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor
and his brethren met us on horseback, in all their formalities, and
proclaimed the King; hence to the Exchange in Cornhill, and so we
returned in the order we set forth.Being come to Whitehall, we all went
and kissed the King and Queen's hands.He had been on the bed, but was
now risen and in his undress.The Queen was in bed in her apartment, but
put forth her hand, seeming to be much afflicted, as I believe she was,
having deported herself so decently upon all occasions since she came
into England, which made her universally beloved.I can never forget the inexpressible luxury and profaneness, gaming, and
all dissoluteness, and as it were total forgetfulness of God (it being
Sunday evening), which this day se'nnight I was witness of, the King
sitting and toying with his concubines, Portsmouth, Cleveland, and
Mazarin, etc., a French boy singing love songs[57] in that glorious
gallery, while about twenty of the great courtiers and other dissolute
persons were at Basset round a large table, a bank of at least 2,000 in
gold before them; upon which two gentlemen, who were with me, made
reflections with astonishment.Six days after, was all in the dust.[Footnote 57: _Ante_, p.It was enjoined that those who put on mourning should wear it as for a
father, in the most solemn manner.Being sent to by the Sheriff of the County to
appear and assist in proclaiming the King, I went the next day to
Bromley, where I met the Sheriff and the Commander of the Kentish Troop,
with an appearance, I suppose, of about 500 horse, and innumerable
people, two of his Majesty's trumpets, and a Sergeant with other
officers, who having drawn up the horse in a large field near the town,
marched thence, with swords drawn, to the market place, where, making a
ring, after sound of trumpets and silence made, the High Sheriff read
the proclaiming titles to his bailiff, who repeated them aloud, and
then, after many shouts of the people, his Majesty's health being drunk
in a flint glass of a yard long, by the Sheriff, Commander, Officers,
and chief gentlemen, they all dispersed, and I returned.I passed a fine on selling of Honson Grange in
Staffordshire, being about L20 per annum, which lying so great a
distance, I thought fit to part with it to one Burton, a farmer there.It came to me as part of my daughter-in-law's portion, this being but a
fourth part of what was divided between the mother and three sisters.The King was this night very obscurely buried in a
vault under Henry VII.'s Chapel at Westminster, without any manner of
pomp, and soon forgotten after all this vanity, and the face of the
whole Court was exceedingly changed into a more solemn and moral
behavior; the new King affecting neither profaneness nor buffoonery.All
the great officers broke their staves over the grave, according to form.The second
sermon should have been before the King; but he, to the great grief of
his subjects, did now, for the first time, go to mass publicly in the
little Oratory at the Duke's lodgings, the doors being set wide open.I dined at Sir Robert Howard's, auditor of the
exchequer, a gentleman pretending to all manner of arts and sciences,
for which he had been the subject of comedy, under the name of Sir
Positive; not ill-natured, but insufferably boasting.He was son to the
late Earl of Berkshire.This morning his Majesty restored the staff and key
to Lord Arlington, Chamberlain; to Mr.Savell, Vice-chamberlain; to
Lords Newport and Maynard, Treasurer and Comptroller of the household.Lord Godolphin made Chamberlain to the Queen; Lord Peterborough groom of
the stole, in place of the Earl of Bath; the Treasurer's staff to the
Earl of Rochester; and his brother, the Earl of Clarendon, Lord Privy
Seal, in the place of the Marquis of Halifax, who was made President of
the Council; the Secretaries of State remaining as before.The Lord Treasurer and the other new officers were
sworn at the Chancery Bar and the exchequer.The late King having the revenue of excise, customs, and other late
duties granted for his life only, they were now farmed and let to
several persons, upon an opinion that the late King might let them for
three years after his decease; some of the old commissioners refused to
act.The lease was made but the day before the King died;[58] the major
part of the Judges (but, as some think, not the best lawyers),
pronounced it legal, but four dissented.[Footnote 58: James, in his Life, makes no mention of this lease,
    but only says HE continued to collect them, which conduct was not
    blamed; but, on the contrary, he was thanked for it, in an address
    from the Middle Temple, penned by Sir Bartholomew Shore, and
    presented by Sir Humphrey Mackworth, carrying great authority with
    it; nor did the Parliament find fault.]The clerk of the closet had shut up the late King's private oratory next
the Privy-chamber above, but the King caused it to be opened again, and
that prayers should be said as formerly.Several most useful tracts against Dissenters,
<DW7>s and Fanatics, and resolutions of cases were now published by the
London divines.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th March, 1685.To my grief, I saw the new pulpit set up in the Popish
Oratory at Whitehall for the Lent preaching, mass being publicly said,
and the Romanists swarming at Court with greater confidence than had
ever been seen in England since the Reformation, so that everybody grew
jealous as to what this would tend.A Parliament was now summoned, and great industry used to obtain
elections which might promote the Court interest, most of the
corporations being now, by their new charters, empowered to make what
returns of members they pleased.There came over divers envoys and great persons to condole the death of
the late King, who were received by the Queen-Dowager on a bed of
mourning, the whole chamber, ceiling and floor, hung with black, and
tapers were lighted, so as nothing could be more lugubrious and solemn.The Queen-Consort sat under a state on a black foot-cloth, to entertain
the circle (as the Queen used to do), and that very decently.Lent preachers continued as formerly in the Royal
Chapel.My daughter, Mary, was taken with smallpox, and there
soon was found no hope of her recovery.A great affliction to me: but
God's holy will be done!She received the blessed sacrament; after which,
disposing herself to suffer what God should determine to inflict, she
bore the remainder of her sickness with extraordinary patience and
piety, and more than ordinary resignation and blessed frame of mind.She
died the 14th, to our unspeakable sorrow and affliction, and not to
our's only, but that of all who knew her, who were many of the best
quality, greatest and most virtuous persons.The justness of her
stature, person, comeliness of countenance, gracefulness of motion,
unaffected, though more than ordinarily beautiful, were the least of her
ornaments compared with those of her mind.Of early piety, singularly
religious, spending a part of every day in private devotion, reading,
and other virtuous exercises; she had collected and written out many of
the most useful and judicious periods of the books she read in a kind of
common-place, as out of Dr.Hammond on the New Testament, and most of
the best practical treatises.She had read and digested a considerable
deal of history, and of places.The French tongue was as familiar to her
as English; she understood Italian, and was able to render a laudable
account of what she read and observed, to which assisted a most faithful
memory and discernment; and she did make very prudent and discreet
reflections upon what she had observed of the conversations among which
she had at any time been, which being continually of persons of the best
quality, she thereby improved.She had an excellent voice, to which she
played a thorough-bass on the harpsichord, in both which she arrived to
that perfection, that of the scholars of those two famous masters,
Signors Pietro and Bartholomeo, she was esteemed the best; for the
sweetness of her voice and management of it added such an agreeableness
to her countenance, without any constraint or concern, that when she
sung, it was as charming to the eye as to the ear; this I rather note,
because it was a universal remark, and for which so many noble and
judicious persons in music desired to hear her, the last being at Lord
Arundel's, at Wardour.What shall I say, or rather not say, of the cheerfulness and
agreeableness of her humor?condescending to the meanest servant in the
family, or others, she still kept up respect, without the least pride.She would often read to them, examine, instruct, and pray with them if
they were sick, so as she was exceedingly beloved of everybody.Piety
was so prevalent an ingredient in her constitution (as I may say), that
even among equals and superiors she no sooner became intimately
acquainted, but she would endeavor to improve them, by insinuating
something religious, and that tended to bring them to a love of
devotion; she had one or two confidants with whom she used to pass whole
days in fasting, reading, and prayers, especially before the monthly
communion, and other solemn occasions.She abhorred flattery, and,
though she had abundance of wit, the raillery was so innocent and
ingenious that it was most agreeable; she sometimes would see a play,
but since the stage grew licentious, expressed herself weary of them,
and the time spent at the theater was an unaccountable vanity.She never
played at cards without extreme importunity and for the company; but
this was so very seldom, that I cannot number it among anything she
could name a fault.No one could read prose or verse better or with more judgment; and as
she read, so she wrote, not only most correct orthography, with that
maturity of judgment and exactness of the periods, choice of
expressions, and familiarity of style, that some letters of hers have
astonished me and others, to whom she has occasionally written.She had
a talent of rehearsing any comical part or poem, as to them she might be
decently free with; was more pleasing than heard on the theater; she
danced with the greatest grace I had ever seen, and so would her master
say, who was Monsieur Isaac; but she seldom showed that perfection, save
in the gracefulness of her carriage, which was with an air of sprightly
modesty not easily to be described.Nothing affected, but natural and
easy as well in her deportment as in her discourse, which was always
material, not trifling, and to which the extraordinary sweetness of her
tone, even in familiar speaking, was very charming.Nothing was so
pretty as her descending to play with little children, whom she would
caress and humor with great delight.But she most affected to be with
grave and sober men, of whom she might learn something, and improve
herself.I have been assisted by her in reading and praying by me;
comprehensive of uncommon notions, curious of knowing everything to some
excess, had I not sometimes repressed it.Nothing was so delightful to her as to go into my Study, where she would
willingly have spent whole days, for as I said she had read abundance of
history, and all the best poets, even Terence, Plautus, Homer, Virgil,
Horace, Ovid; all the best romancers and modern poems; she could compose
happily and put in pretty symbols, as in the "_Mundus Muliebris_,"
wherein is an enumeration of the immense variety of the modes and
ornaments belonging to the sex.But all these are vain trifles to the
virtues which adorned her soul; she was sincerely religious, most
dutiful to her parents, whom she loved with an affection tempered with
great esteem, so as we were easy and free, and never were so well
pleased as when she was with us, nor needed we other conversation; she
was kind to her sisters, and was still improving them by her constant
course of piety.Oh, dear, sweet, and desirable child, how shall I part
with all this goodness and virtue without the bitterness of sorrow and
reluctancy of a tender parent!Thy affection, duty and love to me was
that of a friend as well as a child.Nor less dear to thy mother, whose
example and tender care of thee was unparalleled, nor was thy return to
her less conspicuous.To the grave shall we both carry thy memory!God alone (in
whose bosom thou art at rest and happy!)give us to resign thee and all
our contentments (for thou indeed wert all in this world) to his blessed
pleasure!Let him be glorified by our submission, and give us grace to
bless him for the graces he implanted in thee, thy virtuous life, pious
and holy death, which is indeed the only comfort of our souls, hastening
through the infinite love and mercy of the Lord Jesus to be shortly with
thee, dear child, and with thee and those blessed saints like thee,
glorify the Redeemer of the world to all eternity!It was in the 19th year of her age that this sickness happened to her.An accident contributed to this disease; she had an apprehension of it
in particular, which struck her but two days before she came home, by an
imprudent gentlewoman whom she went with Lady Falkland to visit, who,
after they had been a good while in the house, told them she has a
servant sick of the smallpox (who indeed died the next day): this my
poor child acknowledged made an impression on her spirits.There were
four gentlemen of quality offering to treat with me about marriage, and
I freely gave her her own choice, knowing her discretion.She showed
great indifference to marrying at all, for truly, says she to her mother
(the other day), were I assured of your life and my dear father's, never
would I part from you; I love you and this home, where we serve God,
above all things, nor ever shall I be so happy; I know and consider the
vicissitudes of the world, I have some experience of its vanities, and
but for decency more than inclination, and that you judge it expedient
for me, I would not change my condition, but rather add the fortune you
design me to my sisters, and keep up the reputation of our family.This
was so discreetly and sincerely uttered that it could not but proceed
from an extraordinary child, and one who loved her parents beyond
example.At London, she took this fatal disease, and the occasion of her being
there was this: my Lord Viscount Falkland's Lady having been our
neighbor (as he was Treasurer of the Navy), she took so great an
affection to my daughter, that when they went back in the autumn to the
city, nothing would satisfy their incessant importunity but letting her
accompany my Lady, and staying some time with her; it was with the
greatest reluctance I complied.While she was there, my Lord being
musical, when I saw my Lady would not part with her till Christmas, I
was not unwilling she should improve the opportunity of learning of
Signor Pietro, who had an admirable way both of composure and teaching.It was the end of February before I could prevail with my Lady to part
with her; but my Lord going into Oxfordshire to stand for Knight of the
Shire there, she expressed her wish to come home, being tired of the
vain and empty conversation of the town, the theaters, the court, and
trifling visits which consumed so much precious time, and made her
sometimes miss of that regular course of piety that gave her the
greatest satisfaction.She was weary of this life, and I think went not
thrice to Court all this time, except when her mother or I carried her.She did not affect showing herself, she knew the Court well, and passed
one summer in it at Windsor with Lady Tuke, one of the Queen's women of
the bedchamber (a most virtuous relation of hers); she was not fond of
that glittering scene, now become abominably licentious, though there
was a design of Lady Rochester and Lady Clarendon to have made her a
maid of honor to the Queen as soon as there was a vacancy.But this she
did not set her heart upon, nor indeed on anything so much as the
service of God, a quiet and regular life, and how she might improve
herself in the most necessary accomplishments, and to which she was
arrived at so great a measure.This is the little history and imperfect character of my dear child,
whose piety, virtue, and incomparable endowments deserve a monument more
durable than brass and marble.Much I could enlarge on every period of this hasty account, but that I
ease and discharge my overcoming passion for the present, so many things
worthy an excellent Christian and dutiful child crowding upon me.Never
can I say enough, oh dear, my dear child, whose memory is so precious to
me!This dear child was born at Wotton, in the same house and chamber in
which I first drew my breath, my wife having retired to my brother there
in the great sickness that year upon the first of that month, and the
very hour that I was born, upon the last: viz, October.[Sidenote: SAYES COURT]

16th March, 1685.She was interred in the southeast end of the church at
Deptford, near her grandmother and several of my younger children and
relations.My desire was she should have been carried and laid among my
own parents and relations at Wotton, where I desire to be interred
myself, when God shall call me out of this uncertain transitory life,
but some circumstances did not permit it.Holden,
preached her funeral sermon on Phil."For to me to live is
Christ, and to die is gain," upon which he made an apposite discourse,
as those who heard it assured me (for grief suffered me not to be
present), concluding with a modest recital of her many virtues and
signal piety, so as to draw both tears and admiration from the hearers.I was not altogether unwilling that something of this sort should be
spoken, for the edification and encouragement of other young people.Divers noble persons honored her funeral, some in person, others
sending their coaches, of which there were six or seven with six horses,
viz, the Countess of Sunderland, Earl of Clarendon, Lord Godolphin, Sir
Stephen Fox, Sir William Godolphin, Viscount Falkland, and others.There
were distributed among her friends about sixty rings.Thus lived, died, and was buried the joy of my life, and ornament of her
sex and of my poor family!God Almighty of his infinite mercy grant me
the grace thankfully to resign myself and all I have, or had, to his
divine pleasure, and in his good time, restoring health and comfort to
my family: "teach me so to number my days, that I may apply my heart to
wisdom," be prepared for my dissolution, and that into the hands of my
blessed Savior I may recommend my spirit!On looking into her closet, it is incredible what a number of
collections she had made from historians, poets, travelers, etc., but,
above all, devotions, contemplations, and resolutions on these
contemplations, found under her hand in a book most methodically
disposed; prayers, meditations, and devotions on particular occasions,
with many pretty letters to her confidants; one to a divine (not named)
to whom she writes that he would be her ghostly father, and would not
despise her for her many errors and the imperfections of her youth, but
beg of God to give her courage to acquaint him with all her faults,
imploring his assistance and spiritual directions.I well remember she
had often desired me to recommend her to such a person; but I did not
think fit to do it as yet, seeing her apt to be scrupulous, and knowing
the great innocency and integrity of her life.It is astonishing how one who had acquired such substantial and
practical knowledge in other ornamental parts of education, especially
music, both vocal and instrumental, in dancing, paying and receiving
visits, and necessary conversation, could accomplish half of what she
has left; but, as she never affected play or cards, which consume a
world of precious time, so she was in continual exercise, which yet
abated nothing of her most agreeable conversation.But she was a little
miracle while she lived, and so she died!I was invited to the funeral of Captain Gunman, that
excellent pilot and seaman, who had behaved himself so gallantly in the
Dutch war.He died of a gangrene, occasioned by his fall from the pier
of Calais.This was the Captain of the yacht carrying the Duke (now
King) to Scotland, and was accused for not giving timely warning when
she split on the sands, where so many perished; but I am most confident
he was no ways guilty, either of negligence, or design, as he made
appear not only at the examination of the matter of fact, but in the
vindication he showed me, and which must needs give any man of reason
satisfaction.He was a sober, frugal, cheerful, and temperate man; we
have few such seamen left.Being now somewhat composed after my great affliction,
I went to London to hear Dr.Tenison (it being on a Wednesday in Lent)
at Whitehall.I observed that though the King was not in his seat above
in the chapel, the Doctor made his three congees, which they were not
used to do when the late King was absent, making then one bowing only.I
asked the reason; it was said he had a special order so to do.The
Princess of Denmark was in the King's closet, but sat on the left hand
of the chair, the Clerk of the Closet standing by his Majesty's chair,
as if he had been present.I met the Queen Dowager going now first from Whitehall to dwell at
Somerset House.This day my brother of Wotton and Mr.Onslow were candidates for Surrey
against Sir Adam Brown and my cousin, Sir Edward Evelyn, and were
circumvented in their election by a trick of the Sheriff's, taking
advantage of my brother's party going out of the small village of
Leatherhead to seek shelter and lodging, the afternoon being
tempestuous, proceeding to the election when they were gone; they
expecting the next morning; whereas before and then they exceeded the
other party by many hundreds, as I am assured.The Duke of Norfolk led
Sir Edward Evelyn's and Sir Adam Brown's party.For this Parliament,
very mean and slight persons (some of them gentlemen's servants, clerks,
and persons neither of reputation nor interest) were set up; but the
country would choose my brother whether he would or no, and he missed it
by the trick above mentioned.Sir Adam Brown was so deaf, that he could
not hear one word.Sir Edward Evelyn was an honest gentleman, much in
favor with his Majesty.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th April, 1685.I went early to Whitehall to hear Dr.Tillotson, Dean
of Canterbury, preaching on Eccles.I returned in the evening,
and visited Lady Tuke, and found with her Sir George Wakeman, the
physician, whom I had seen tried and acquitted, among the plotters for
poisoning the late King, on the accusation of the famous Oates; and
surely I believed him guiltless.According to my custom, I went to London to pass the
holy week.Tenison preached at the new church at
St.22, upon the infinite love of God to us, which
he illustrated in many instances.The Holy Sacrament followed, at which
I participated.Sprat,
Bishop of Rochester, preached in Whitehall chapel, the auditory very
full of Lords, the two Archbishops, and many others, now drawn to town
upon occasion of the coronation and ensuing Parliament.I supped with
the Countess of Sunderland and Lord Godolphin, and returned home.Was the coronation of the King and Queen.The solemnity
was magnificent as is set forth in print.The Bishop of Ely preached;
but, to the sorrow of the people, no Sacrament, as ought to have been.However, the King begins his reign with great expectations, and hopes of
much reformation as to the late vices and profaneness of both Court and
country.Having been present at the late King's coronation, I was not
ambitious of seeing this ceremony.A young man preached, going chaplain with Sir J. Wiburn,
Governor of Bombay, in the East Indies.I was in Westminster Hall when Oates, who had made such
a stir in the kingdom, on his revealing a plot of the <DW7>s, and
alarmed several Parliaments, and had occasioned the execution of divers
priests, noblemen, etc., was tried for perjury at the King's bench; but,
being very tedious, I did not endeavor to see the issue, considering
that it would be published.Abundance of Roman Catholics were in the
hall in expectation of the most grateful conviction and ruin of a person
who had been so obnoxious to them, and as I verily believe, had done
much mischief and great injury to several by his violent and
ill-grounded proceedings; while he was at first so unreasonably blown up
and encouraged, that his insolence was no longer sufferable.Roger L'Estrange (a gentleman whom I had long known, and a person of
excellent parts, abating some affectations) appearing first against the
Dissenters in several tracts, had now for some years turned his style
against those whom (by way of hateful distinction) they called Whigs and
Trimmers, under the title of "Observator," which came out three or four
days every week, in which sheets, under pretense to serve the Church of
England, he gave suspicion of gratifying another party, by several
passages which rather kept up animosities than appeased them, especially
now that nobody gave the least occasion.[59]

    [Footnote 59: In the first Dutch war, while Evelyn was one of the
    Commissioners for sick and wounded, L'Estrange in his "Gazette"
    mentioned the barbarous usage of the Dutch prisoners of war:
    whereupon Evelyn wrote him a very spirited letter, desiring that the
    Dutch Ambassador (who was then in England) and his friends would
    visit the prisoners, and examine their provisions; and he required
    L'Estrange to publish that vindication in his next number.]The Scots valuing themselves exceedingly to have been
the first Parliament called by his Majesty, gave the excise and customs
to him and his successors forever; the Duke of Queensberry making
eloquent speeches, and especially minding them of a speedy suppression
of those late desperate Field-Conventiclers who had done such unheard of
assassinations.In the meantime, elections for the ensuing Parliament in
England were thought to be very indirectly carried on in most places.God grant a better issue of it than some expect!Oates was sentenced to be whipped and pilloried with the
utmost severity.I dined at my Lord Privy Seal's with Sir William
Dugdale, Garter King-at-Arms, author of the "MONASTICON" and other
learned works; he told me he was 82 years of age, and had his sight and
memory perfect.There was shown a draft of the exact shape and
dimensions of the crown the Queen had been crowned withal, together with
the jewels and pearls, their weight and value, which amounted to
L100,658 sterling, attested at the foot of the paper by the jeweler and
goldsmith who set them.In the morning, I went with a French gentleman, and my
Lord Privy Seal to the House of Lords, where we were placed by his
Lordship next the bar, just below the bishops, very commodiously both
for hearing and seeing.After a short space, came in the Queen and
Princess of Denmark, and stood next above the archbishops, at the side
of the House on the right hand of the throne.In the interim, divers of
the Lords, who had not finished before, took the test and usual oaths,
so that her Majesty, the Spanish and other Ambassadors, who stood behind
the throne, heard the Pope and the worship of the Virgin Mary, etc.,
renounced very decently, as likewise the prayers which followed,
standing all the while.Then came in the King, the crown on his head,
and being seated, the Commons were introduced, and the House being full,
he drew forth a paper containing his speech, which he read distinctly
enough, to this effect: "That he resolved to call a Parliament from the
moment of his brother's decease, as the best means to settle all the
concerns of the nation, so as to be most easy and happy to himself and
his subjects; that he would confirm whatever he had said in his
declaration at the first Council concerning his opinion of the
principles of the Church of England, for their loyalty, and would defend
and support it, and preserve its government as by law now established;
that, as he would invade no man's property, so he would never depart
from his own prerogative; and, as he had ventured his life in defense of
the nation, so he would proceed to do still; that, having given this
assurance of his care of our religion (his word was YOUR religion) and
property (which he had not said by chance, but solemnly), so he doubted
not of suitable returns of his subjects' duty and kindness, especially
as to settling his revenue for life, for the many weighty necessities of
government, which he would not suffer to be precarious; that some might
possibly suggest that it were better to feed and supply him from time to
time only, out of their inclination to frequent Parliaments; but that
that would be a very improper method to take with him, since the best
way to engage him to meet oftener would be always to use him well, and
therefore he expected their compliance speedily, that this session being
but short, they might meet again to satisfaction."At every period of this, the House gave loud shouts.Then he acquainted
them with that morning's news of Argyle's being landed in the West
Highlands of Scotland from Holland, and the treasonous declaration he
had published, which he would communicate to them, and that he should
take the best care he could it should meet with the reward it deserved,
not questioning the Parliament's zeal and readiness to assist him as he
desired; at which there followed another "_Vive le Roi_," and so his
Majesty retired.So soon as the Commons were returned and had put themselves into a grand
committee, they immediately put the question, and unanimously voted the
revenue to his Majesty for life.Seymour made a bold speech against
many elections, and would have had those members who (he pretended) were
obnoxious, to withdraw, till they had cleared the matter of their being
legally returned; but no one seconded him.The truth is, there were many
of the new members whose elections and returns were universally
censured, many of them being persons of no condition, or interest, in
the nation, or places for which they served, especially in Devon,
Cornwall, Norfolk, etc., said to have been recommended by the Court, and
from the effect of the new charters changing the electors.It was
reported that Lord Bath carried down with him [into Cornwall] no fewer
than fifteen charters, so that some called him the Prince Elector:
whence Seymour told the House in his speech that if this was digested,
they might introduce what religion and laws they pleased, and that
though he never gave heed to the fears and jealousies of the people
before, he was now really apprehensive of Popery.By the printed list of
members of 505, there did not appear to be above 135 who had been in
former Parliaments, especially that lately held at Oxford.In the Lords' House, Lord Newport made an exception against two or three
young Peers, who wanted some months, and some only four or five days, of
being of age.The Popish Lords, who had been sometime before released from their
confinement about the plot, were now discharged of their impeachment, of
which I gave Lord Arundel of Wardour joy.Oates, who had but two days before been pilloried at several places and
whipped at the cart's tail from Newgate to Aldgate, was this day placed
on a sledge, being not able to go by reason of so late scourging, and
dragged from prison to Tyburn, and whipped again all the way, which some
thought to be severe and extraordinary; but, if he was guilty of the
perjuries, and so of the death of many innocents (as I fear he was), his
punishment was but what he deserved.I chanced to pass just as execution
was doing on him.Note: there was no speech made by the Lord Keeper [Bridgman] after his
Majesty, as usual.It was whispered he would not be long in that situation, and many
believe the bold Chief Justice Jefferies, who was made Baron of Wem, in
Shropshire, and who went thorough stitch in that tribunal, stands fair
for that office.I gave him joy the morning before of his new honor, he
having always been very civil to me.We had hitherto not any rain for many months, so as the
caterpillars had already devoured all the winter fruit through the whole
land, and even killed several greater old trees.Such two winters and
summers I had never known.Came to visit and take leave of me Sir Gabriel Sylvius,
now going Envoy-extraordinary into Denmark, with his secretary and
chaplain, a Frenchman, who related the miserable persecution of the
Protestants in France; not above ten churches left them, and those also
threatened to be demolished; they were commanded to christen their
children within twenty-four hours after birth, or else a Popish priest
was to be called, and then the infant brought up in Popery.In some
places, they were thirty leagues from any minister, or opportunity of
worship.This persecution had displeased the most industrious part of
the nation, and dispersed those into Switzerland, Burgundy, Holland,
Germany, Denmark, England, and the Plantations.There were with Sir
Gabriel, his lady, Sir William Godolphin and sisters, and my Lord
Godolphin's little son, my charge.I brought them to the water side
where Sir Gabriel embarked, and the rest returned to London.There was now certain intelligence of the Duke of
Monmouth landing at Lyme, in Dorsetshire, and of his having set up his
standard as King of England.I pray God deliver us from the confusion
which these beginnings threaten!Such a dearth for want of rain was never in my memory.The Duke landed with but 150 men; but the whole kingdom
was alarmed, fearing that the disaffected would join them, many of the
trained bands flocking to him.At his landing, he published a
Declaration, charging his Majesty with usurpation and several horrid
crimes, on pretense of his own title, and offering to call a free
Parliament.This declaration was ordered to be burnt by the hangman, the
Duke proclaimed a traitor, and a reward of L5,000 to any who should kill
him.At this time, the words engraved on the monument in London, intimating
that the <DW7>s fired the city, were erased and cut out.I received a warrant to send out a horse with twelve
days' provisions, etc.We had now plentiful rain after two years' excessive
drought and severe winters.Argyle taken in Scotland, and executed, and his party dispersed.No considerable account of the troops sent against the
Duke, though great forces sent.There was a smart skirmish; but he would
not be provoked to come to an encounter, but still kept in the
fastnesses.Dangerfield whipped, like Oates, for perjury.Came news of Monmouth's utter defeat, and the next day
of his being taken by Sir William Portman and Lord Lumley with the
militia of their counties.It seems the Horse, commanded by Lord Grey,
being newly raised and undisciplined, were not to be brought in so short
a time to endure the fire, which exposed the Foot to the King's, so as
when Monmouth had led the Foot in great silence and order, thinking to
surprise Lieutenant-General Lord Feversham newly encamped, and given him
a smart charge, interchanging both great and small shot, the Horse,
breaking their own ranks, Monmouth gave it over, and fled with Grey,
leaving their party to be cut in pieces to the number of 2,000.The
whole number reported to be above 8,000; the King's but 2,700.The slain
were most of them MENDIP-MINERS, who did great execution with their
tools, and sold their lives very dearly, while their leaders flying were
pursued and taken the next morning, not far from one another.Monmouth
had gone sixteen miles on foot, changing his habit for a poor coat, and
was found by Lord Lumley in a dry ditch covered with fern-brakes, but
without sword, pistol, or any weapon, and so might have passed for some
countryman, his beard being grown so long and so gray as hardly to be
known, had not his George discovered him, which was found in his pocket.It is said he trembled exceedingly all over, not able to speak.Grey was
taken not far from him.Most of his party were Anabaptists and poor
cloth workers of the country, no gentlemen of account being come in to
him.The arch-_boutefeu_, Ferguson, Matthews, etc., were not yet found.The L5,000 to be given to whoever should bring Monmouth in, was to be
distributed among the militia by agreement between Sir William Portman
and Lord Lumley.The battle ended, some words, first in jest, then in
passion, passed between Sherrington Talbot (a worthy gentleman, son to
Sir John Talbot, and who had behaved himself very handsomely) and one
Captain Love, both commanders of the militia, as to whose soldiers
fought best, both drawing their swords and passing at one another.Sherrington was wounded to death on the spot, to the great regret of
those who knew him.[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th July, 1685.Just as I was coming into the lodgings at Whitehall, a
little before dinner, my Lord of Devonshire standing very near his
Majesty's bedchamber door in the lobby, came Colonel Culpeper, and in a
rude manner looking at my Lord in the face, asked whether this was a
time and place for excluders to appear; my Lord at first took little
notice of what he said, knowing him to be a hotheaded fellow, but he
reiterating it, my Lord asked Culpeper whether he meant him; he said
yes, he meant his Lordship.My Lord told him he was no excluder (as
indeed he was not); the other affirming it again, my Lord told him he
lied; on which Culpeper struck him a box on the ear, which my Lord
returned, and felled him.They were soon parted, Culpeper was seized,
and his Majesty, who was all the while in his bedchamber, ordered him to
be carried to the Greencloth officer, who sent him to the Marshalsea, as
he deserved.I supped this night at Lambeth at my old friend's Mr.Elias Ashmole's,
with my Lady Clarendon, the Bishop of St.Tenison, when
we were treated at a great feast.The Count of Castel Mellor, that great favorite and
prime minister of Alphonso, late King of Portugal, after several years'
banishment, being now received to grace and called home by Don Pedro,
the present King, as having been found a person of the greatest
integrity after all his sufferings, desired me to spend part of this day
with him, and assist him in a collection of books and other curiosities,
which he would carry with him into Portugal.Hussey, a young gentleman who made love to my late dear child, but
whom she could not bring herself to answer in affection, died now of the
same cruel disease, for which I was extremely sorry, because he never
enjoyed himself after my daughter's decease, nor was I averse to the
match, could she have overcome her disinclination.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th July, 1685.Monmouth was this day brought to London and examined before the King,
to whom he made great submission, acknowledged his seduction by
Ferguson, the Scot, whom he named the bloody villain.He was sent to the
Tower, had an interview with his late Duchess, whom he received coldly,
having lived dishonestly with the Lady Henrietta Wentworth for two
years.He obstinately asserted his conversation with that debauched
woman to be no sin; whereupon, seeing he could not be persuaded to his
last breath, the divines who were sent to assist him thought not fit to
administer the Holy Communion to him.For the rest of his faults he
professed great sorrow, and so died without any apparent fear.He would
not make use of a cap or other circumstance, but lying down, bid the
fellow to do his office better than to the late Lord Russell, and gave
him gold; but the wretch made five chops before he had his head off;
which so incensed the people, that had he not been guarded and got away,
they would have torn him to pieces.The Duke made no speech on the scaffold (which was on Tower Hill), but
gave a paper containing not above five or six lines, for the King, in
which he disclaims all title to the Crown, acknowledges that the late
King, his father, had indeed told him he was but his base son, and so
desired his Majesty to be kind to his wife and children.Martin's), who, with the Bishops of
Ely and Bath and Wells, were sent to him by his Majesty, and were at the
execution.Thus ended this quondam Duke, darling of his father and the ladies,
being extremely handsome and adroit, an excellent soldier and dancer, a
favorite of the people, of an easy nature, debauched by lust; seduced by
crafty knaves, who would have set him up only to make a property, and
taken the opportunity of the King being of another religion, to gather a
party of discontented men.He was a lovely person, had a virtuous and excellent lady that brought
him great riches, and a second dukedom in Scotland.He was Master of the
Horse, General of the King his father's army, Gentleman of the
Bedchamber, Knight of the Garter, Chancellor of Cambridge, in a word,
had accumulations without end.See what ambition and want of principles
brought him to!He was beheaded on Tuesday, 14th of July.His mother,
whose name was Barlow, daughter of some very mean creatures, was a
beautiful strumpet, whom I had often seen at Paris; she died miserably
without anything to bury her; yet this Perkin had been made to believe
that the King had married her, a monstrous and ridiculous forgery!And
to satisfy the world of the iniquity of the report, the King his father
(if his father he really was, for he most resembled one Sidney who was
familiar with his mother) publicly and most solemnly renounced it, to be
so entered in the Council Book some years since, with all the Privy
Councillors' attestation.[60]

    [Footnote 60: The "Life of James II."contains an account of the
    circumstances of the Duke of Monmouth's birth, which may be given in
    illustration of the statements of the text.Ross, tutor to the Duke
    of Monmouth, is there said to have proposed to Bishop Cosins to sign
    a certificate of the King's marriage to Mrs.Barlow, though her own
    name was Walters: but this the Bishop refused.She was born of a
    gentleman's family in Wales, but having little means and less grace,
    came to London to make her fortune.Algernon Sydney, then a Colonel
    in Cromwell's army, had agreed to give her fifty broad pieces (as he
    told the Duke of York); but being ordered hastily away with his
    regiment, he missed his bargain.She went into Holland, where she
    fell into the hands of his brother, Colonel Robert Sydney, who kept
    her for some time, till the King hearing of her, got her from him.On which the Colonel was heard to say, Let who will have her, she is
    already sped; and, after being with the King, she was so soon with
    child, that the world had no cause to doubt whose child it was, and
    the rather that when he grew to be a man, he very much resembled the
    Colonel both in stature and countenance, even to a wart on his face.In the King's absence she behaved
    so loosely, that on his return from his escape at Worcester he would
    have no further commerce with her, and she became a common
    prostitute at Paris.]Had it not pleased God to dissipate this attempt in the beginning, there
would in all appearance have gathered an irresistible force which would
have desperately proceeded to the ruin of the Church and Government; so
general was the discontent and expectation of the opportunity.For my
own part, I looked upon this deliverance as most signal.Such an
inundation of fanatics and men of impious principles must needs have
caused universal disorder, cruelty, injustice, rapine, sacrilege, and
confusion, an unavoidable civil war, and misery without end.Blessed be
God, the knot was happily broken, and a fair prospect of tranquillity
for the future, if we reform, be thankful, and make a right use of this
mercy!I went to see the muster of the six Scotch and English
regiments whom the Prince of Orange had lately sent to his Majesty out
of Holland upon this rebellion, but which were now returning, there
having been no occasion for their use.They were all excellently clad
and well disciplined, and were encamped on Blackheath with their tents:
the King and Queen came to see them exercise, and the manner of their
encampment, which was very neat and magnificent.By a gross mistake of the Secretary of his Majesty's Forces, it had
been ordered that they should be quartered in private houses, contrary
to an Act of Parliament, but, on my informing his Majesty timely of it,
it was prevented.The two horsemen which my son and myself sent into the county troops,
were now come home, after a month's being out to our great charge.The Trinity Company met this day, which should have
been on the Monday after Trinity, but was put off by reason of the Royal
Charter being so large, that it could not be ready before.Pepys, Secretary to the Admiralty, was a
second time chosen Master.There were present the Duke of Grafton, Lord
Dartmouth, Master of the Ordnance, the Commissioners of the Navy, and
Brethren of the Corporation.We went to church, according to custom, and
then took barge to the Trinity House, in London, where we had a great
dinner, above eighty at one table.[Sidenote: CHELSEA]

7th August, 1685.Watts, keeper of the Apothecaries'
garden of simples at Chelsea, where there is a collection of innumerable
rarities of that sort particularly, besides many rare annuals, the tree
bearing Jesuit's bark, which had done such wonders in quartan agues.What was very ingenious was the subterranean heat, conveyed by a stove
under the conservatory, all vaulted with brick, so as he has the doors
and windows open in the hardest frosts, secluding only the snow.Boscawen, with my Lord
Godolphin's little son, with whose education hitherto his father had
intrusted me.My daughter Elizabeth died of the smallpox, soon
after having married a young man, nephew of Sir John Tippett, Surveyor
of the Navy, and one of the Commissioners.The 30th, she was buried in
the church at Deptford.Thus, in less than six months were we deprived
of two children for our unworthiness and causes best known to God, whom
I beseech from the bottom of my heart that he will give us grace to make
that right use of all these chastisements, that we may become better,
and entirely submit in all things to his infinitely wise disposal.Lord Clarendon (Lord Privy Seal) wrote to let me
know that the King being pleased to send him Lord-Lieutenant into
Ireland, was also pleased to nominate me one of the Commissioners to
execute the office of Privy Seal during his Lieutenancy there, it
behoving me to wait upon his Majesty to give him thanks for this great
honor.I accompanied his Lordship to Windsor (dining by
the way of Sir Henry Capel's at Kew), where his Majesty receiving me
with extraordinary kindness, I kissed his hand, I told him how sensible
I was of his Majesty's gracious favor to me, that I would endeavor to
serve him with all sincerity, diligence, and loyalty, not more out of my
duty than inclination.He said he doubted not of it, and was glad he had
the opportunity to show me the kindness he had for me.After this, came
abundance of great men to give me joy.I went to prayer in the chapel, and heard
Dr.11, persuading to unity and peace, and to be mindful of our
own business, according to the advice of the apostle.Then I went to
hear a Frenchman who preached before the King and Queen in that splendid
chapel next St.Their Majesties going to mass, I withdrew
to consider the stupendous painting of the Hall, which, both for the art
and invention, deserve the inscription in honor of the painter, Signor
Verrio.receiving the Black Prince, coming
toward him in a Roman triumph.The throne, the carvings, etc., are incomparable, and I think
equal to any, and in many circumstances exceeding any, I have seen
abroad.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, with (among others) Sir William Soames,
designed Ambassador to Constantinople.About 6 o'clock came Sir Dudley and his brother Roger North, and
brought the Great Seal from my Lord Keeper, who died the day before at
his house in Oxfordshire.The King went immediately to council;
everybody guessing who was most likely to succeed this great officer;
most believing it could be no other than my Lord Chief Justice
Jefferies, who had so vigorously prosecuted the late rebels, and was now
gone the Western Circuit, to punish the rest that were secured in
several counties, and was now near upon his return.I took my leave of
his Majesty, who spoke very graciously to me, and supping that night at
Sir Stephen Fox's, I promised to dine there the next day.Pepys to Portsmouth, whither his
Majesty was going the first time since his coming to the Crown, to see
in what state the fortifications were.We took coach and six horses,
late after dinner, yet got to Bagshot that night.While supper was
making ready I went and made a visit to Mrs.Graham, some time maid of
honor to the Queen Dowager, now wife to James Graham, Esq., of the privy
purse to the King; her house being a walk in the forest, within a little
quarter of a mile from Bagshot town.Very importunate she was that I
would sup, and abide there that night; but, being obliged by my
companion, I returned to our inn, after she had shown me her house,
which was very commodious, and well furnished, as she was an excellent
housewife, a prudent and virtuous lady.There is a park full of red deer
about it.Her eldest son was now sick there of the smallpox, but in a
likely way of recovery, and other of her children run about, and among
the infected, which she said she let them do on purpose that they might
while young pass that fatal disease she fancied they were to undergo one
time or other, and that this would be the best: the severity of this
cruel distemper so lately in my poor family confirming much of what she
affirmed.[Sidenote: WINCHESTER]

16th September, 1685.The next morning, setting out early, we arrived
soon enough at Winchester to wait on the King, who was lodged at the
Dean's (Dr.I found very few with him besides my Lords
Feversham, Arran, Newport, and the Bishop of Bath and Wells.His Majesty
was discoursing with the bishops concerning miracles, and what strange
things the Saludadors[61] would do in Spain, as by creeping into heated
ovens without hurt, and that they had a black cross in the roof of their
mouths, but yet were commonly notorious and profane wretches; upon which
his Majesty further said, that he was so extremely difficult of
miracles, for fear of being imposed upon, that if he should chance to
see one himself, without some other witness, he should apprehend it a
delusion of his senses.Then they spoke of the boy who was pretended to
have a wanting leg restored him, so confidently asserted by Fr.To all of which the Bishop added a great miracle
happening in Winchester to his certain knowledge, of a poor, miserably
sick and decrepit child (as I remember long kept unbaptized) who
immediately on his baptism, recovered; as also of the salutary effect of
King Charles his Majesty's father's blood, in healing one that was
blind.[Footnote 61: Evelyn subjoins this note:--"As to that of the
    Saludador (of which likewise I remember Sir Arthur Hopton, formerly
    as Ambassador at Madrid, had told me many like wonders), Mr.Pepys
    passing through Spain, and being extremely inquisitive of the truth
    of these pretended miracles of the Saludadors, found a very famous
    one at last, to whom he offered a considerable reward if he would
    make a trial of the oven, or any other thing of that kind, before
    him; the fellow ingenuously told him, that finding he was a more
    than ordinary curious person, he would not deceive him, and so
    acknowledged that he could do none of the feats really, but that
    what they pretended was all a cheat, which he would easily discover,
    though the poor superstitious people were easily imposed upon; yet
    have these impostors an allowance of the Bishops to practice their
    jugglings.Pepys affirmed to me; but said he, I did not
    conceive it fit to interrupt his Majesty, who so solemnly told what
    they pretended to do.There was something said of the second sight happening to some persons,
especially Scotch; upon which his Majesty, and I think Lord Arran, told
us that Monsieur... a French nobleman, lately here in England, seeing
the late Duke of Monmouth come into the playhouse at London, suddenly
cried out to somebody sitting in the same box, "_Voila Monsieur comme il
entre sans tete!_" Afterward his Majesty spoke of some relics that had
effected strange cures, particularly a piece of our blessed Savior's
cross, that healed a gentleman's rotten nose by only touching.And
speaking of the golden cross and chain taken out of the coffin of St.Edward the Confessor at Westminster, by one of the singing-men, who, as
the scaffolds were taken down after his Majesty's coronation, espying a
hole in the tomb, and something glisten, put his hand in, and brought it
to the dean, and he to the King; his Majesty began to put the Bishop in
mind how earnestly the late King (his brother) called upon him during
his agony, to take out what he had in his pocket."I had thought," said
the King, "it had been for some keys, which might lead to some cabinet
that his Majesty would have me secure"; but, says he, "you will remember
that I found nothing in any of his pockets but a cross of gold, and a
few insignificant papers"; and thereupon he showed us the cross, and was
pleased to put it into my hand.It was of gold, about three inches long,
having on one side a crucifix enameled and embossed, the rest was graved
and garnished with goldsmiths' work, and two pretty broad table
amethysts (as I conceived), and at the bottom a pendant pearl; within
was enchased a little fragment, as was thought, of the true cross, and a
Latin inscription in gold and Roman letters.More company coming in,
this discourse ended.I may not forget a resolution which his Majesty
made, and had a little before entered upon it at the Council Board at
Windsor or Whitehall, that the <DW64>s in the plantations should all be
baptized, exceedingly declaiming against that impiety of their masters
prohibiting it, out of a mistaken opinion that they would be _ipso
facto_ free; but his Majesty persists in his resolution to have them
christened, which piety the Bishop blessed him for.I went out to see the new palace the late King had begun, and brought
almost to the covering.It is placed on the side of the hill, where
formerly stood the old castle.It is a stately fabric, of three sides
and a corridor, all built of brick, and cornished, windows and columns
at the break and entrance of free-stone.It was intended for a
hunting-house when his Majesty should come to these parts, and has an
incomparable prospect.I believe there had already been L20,000 and more
expended; but his now Majesty did not seem to encourage the finishing it
at least for a while.Hence to see the Cathedral, a reverend pile, and in good repair.There
are still the coffins of the six Saxon Kings, whose bones had been
scattered by the sacrilegious rebels of 1641, in expectation, I suppose,
of finding some valuable relics, and afterward gathered up again and put
into new chests, which stand above the stalls of the choir.[Sidenote: PORTSMOUTH]

17th September, 1685.Early next morning, we went to Portsmouth,
something before his Majesty arrived.We found all the road full of
people, the women in their best dress, in expectation of seeing the King
pass by, which he did, riding on horseback a good part of the way.The
Mayor and Aldermen with their mace, and in their formalities, were
standing at the entrance of the fort, a mile on this side of the town,
where the Mayor made a speech to the King, and then the guns of the fort
were fired, as were those of the garrison, as soon as the King was come
into Portsmouth.All the soldiers (near 3,000) were drawn up, and lining
the streets and platform to God's House (the name of the Governor's
residence), where, after he had viewed the new fortifications and
shipyard, his Majesty was entertained at a magnificent dinner by Sir...
Slingsby, the Lieutenant Governor, all the gentlemen in his train
sitting down at table with him, which I also had done, had I not been
before engaged to Sir Robert Holmes, Governor of the Isle of Wight, to
dine with him at a private house, where likewise we had a very sumptuous
and plentiful repast of excellent venison, fowl, fish, and fruit.After dinner, I went to wait on his Majesty again, who was pulling on
his boots in the Town Hall adjoining the house where he dined, and then
having saluted some ladies, who came to kiss his hand, he took horse for
Winchester, whither he returned that night.This hall is artificially
hung round with arms of all sorts, like the hall and keep at Windsor.Hence, to see the shipyard and dock, the fortifications, and other
things.Portsmouth, when finished, will be very strong, and a noble quay.There
were now thirty-two men-of-war in the harbor.I was invited by Sir R.
Beach, the Commissioner, where, after a great supper, Mr.Secretary and
myself lay that night, and the next morning set out for Guildford, where
we arrived in good hour, and so the day after to London.I had twice before been at Portsmouth, the Isle of Wight, etc., many
years since.I found this part of Hampshire bravely wooded, especially
about the house and estate of Colonel Norton, who though now in being,
having formerly made his peace by means of Colonel Legg, was formerly a
very fierce commander in the first Rebellion.His house is large, and
standing low, on the road from Winchester to Portsmouth.By what I observed in this journey, is that infinite industry,
sedulity, gravity, and great understanding and experience of affairs, in
his Majesty, that I cannot but predict much happiness to the nation, as
to its political government; and, if he so persist, there could be
nothing more desired to accomplish our prosperity, but that he was of
the national religion.Lord Clarendon's commission for Lieutenant of
Ireland was sealed this day.[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d October, 1685.Pepys with this
expression at the foot of it, "I have something to show you that I may
not have another time," and that I would not fail to dine with him.Houblon (a rich and
considerable merchant, whose father had fled out of Flanders on the
persecution of the Duke of Alva) into a private room, and told us that
being lately alone with his Majesty, and upon some occasion of speaking
concerning my late Lord Arlington dying a Roman Catholic, who had all
along seemed to profess himself a Protestant, taken all the tests, etc.,
till the day (I think) of his death, his Majesty said that as to his
inclinations he had known them long wavering, but from fear of losing
his places, he did not think it convenient to declare himself.There
are, says the King, those who believe the Church of Rome gives
dispensations for going to church, and many like things, but that is not
so; for if that might have been had, he himself had most reason to make
use of it.INDEED, he said, as to SOME MATRIMONIAL CASES, THERE ARE NOW
AND THEN DISPENSATIONS, but hardly in any cases else.Pepys to beg of his Majesty, if
he might ask it without offense, and for that his Majesty could not but
observe how it was whispered among many whether his late Majesty had
been reconciled to the Church of Rome; he again humbly besought his
Majesty to pardon his presumption, if he had touched upon a thing which
did not befit him to look into.The King ingenuously told him that he
both was and died a Roman Catholic, and that he had not long since
declared that it was upon some politic and state reasons, best known to
himself (meaning the King his brother), but that he was of that
persuasion: he bid him follow him into his closet, where opening a
cabinet, he showed him two papers, containing about a quarter of a
sheet, on both sides written, in the late King's own hand, several
arguments opposite to the doctrine of the Church of England, charging
her with heresy, novelty, and the fanaticism of other Protestants, the
chief whereof was, as I remember, our refusing to acknowledge the
primacy and infallibility of the Church of Rome; how impossible it was
that so many ages should never dispute it, till of late; how unlikely
our Savior would leave his Church without a visible Head and guide to
resort to, during his absence; with the like usual topic; so well penned
as to the discourse as did by no means seem to me to have been put
together by the late King yet written all with his own hand, blotted and
interlined, so as, if indeed it was not given him by some priest, they
might be such arguments and reasons as had been inculcated from time to
time, and here recollected; and, in the conclusion, showing his looking
on the Protestant religion (and by name the Church of England) to be
without foundation, and consequently false and unsafe.When his Majesty
had shown him these originals, he was pleased to lend him the copies of
these two papers, attested at the bottom in four or five lines under his
own hand.This nice and curious passage I
thought fit to set down.Though all the arguments and objections were
altogether weak, and have a thousand times been answered by our divines;
they are such as their priests insinuate among their proselytes, as if
nothing were Catholic but the Church of Rome, no salvation out of that,
no reformation sufferable, bottoming all their errors on St.Peter's
successors' unerring dictatorship, but proving nothing with any reason,
or taking notice of any objection which could be made against it.Here
all was taken for granted, and upon it a resolution and preference
implied.I was heartily sorry to see all this, though it was no other than was
to be suspected, by his late Majesty's too great indifference, neglect,
and course of life, that he had been perverted, and for secular respects
only professed to be of another belief, and thereby giving great
advantage to our adversaries, both the Court and generally the youth and
great persons of the nation becoming dissolute and highly profane.God
was incensed to make his reign very troublesome and unprosperous, by
wars, plagues, fires, loss of reputation by an universal neglect of the
public for the love of a voluptuous and sensual life, which a vicious
Court had brought into credit.I think of it with sorrow and pity, when
I consider how good and debonair a nature that unhappy Prince was; what
opportunities he had to have made himself the most renowned King that
ever swayed the British scepter, had he been firm to that Church for
which his martyred and blessed father suffered; and had he been grateful
to Almighty God, who so miraculously restored him, with so excellent a
religion; had he endeavored to own and propagate it as he should have
done, not only for the good of his kingdom, but of all the Reformed
Churches in christendom, now weakened and near ruined through our
remissness and suffering them to be supplanted, persecuted, and
destroyed, as in France, which we took no notice of.The consequence of
this, time will show, and I wish it may proceed no further.The
emissaries and instruments of the Church of Rome will never rest till
they have crushed the Church of England, as knowing that alone to be
able to cope with them, and that they can never answer her fairly, but
lie abundantly open to the irresistible force of her arguments,
antiquity and purity of her doctrine, so that albeit it may move God,
for the punishment of a nation so unworthy, to eclipse again the
profession of her here, and darkness and superstition prevail, I am most
confident the doctrine of the Church of England will never be
extinguished, but remain visible, if not eminent, to the consummation of
the world.I have innumerable reasons that confirm me in this opinion,
which I forbear to mention here.In the meantime, as to the discourse of his Majesty with Mr.Pepys, and
those papers, as I do exceedingly prefer his Majesty's free and
ingenuous profession of what his own religion is, beyond concealment
upon any politic accounts, so I think him of a most sincere and honest
nature, one on whose word one may rely, and that he makes a conscience
of what he promises, to perform it.In this confidence, I hope that the
Church of England may yet subsist, and when it shall please God to open
his eyes and turn his heart (for that is peculiarly in the Lord's hands)
to flourish also.In all events, whatever does become of the Church of
England, it is certainly, of all the Christian professions on the earth,
the most primitive, apostolical, and excellent.I had my picture drawn this week by the famous
Kneller.[Sidenote: LONDON]

14th October, 1685.I went to London about finishing my lodgings at
Whitehall.Being the King's birthday, there was a solemn ball
at Court, and before it music of instruments and voices.I happened by
accident to stand the very next to the Queen and the King, who talked
with me about the music.The King was now building all that range from east
to west by the court and garden to the street, and making a new chapel
for the Queen, whose lodgings were to be in this new building, as also a
new Council chamber and offices next the south end of the banqueting
house.I returned home, next morning, to London.I accompanied my Lady Clarendon to her house at
Swallowfield, in Berks, dining by the way at Mr.Graham's lodge at
Bagshot; the house, newly repaired and capacious enough for a good
family, stands in a park.Hence, we went to Swallowfield; this house is after the ancient
building of honorable gentlemen's houses, when they kept up ancient
hospitality, but the gardens and waters as elegant as it is possible to
make a flat by art and industry, and no mean expense, my lady being so
extraordinarily skilled in the flowery part, and my lord in diligence of
planting; so that I have hardly seen a seat which shows more tokens of
it than what is to be found here, not only in the delicious and rarest
fruits of a garden, but in those innumerable timber trees in the ground
about the seat, to the greatest ornament and benefit of the place.There
is one orchard of 1,000 golden, and other cider pippins; walks and
groves of elms, limes, oaks, and other trees.The garden is so beset
with all manner of sweet shrubs, that it perfumes the air.The
distribution also of the quarters, walks, and parterres, is excellent.The nurseries, kitchen-garden full of the most desirable plants; two
very noble orangeries well furnished: but, above all, the canal and fish
ponds, the one fed with a white, the other with a black running water,
fed by a quick and swift river, so well and plentifully stored with
fish, that for pike, carp, bream, and tench, I never saw anything
approaching it.We had at every meal carp and pike of a size fit for the
table of a Prince, and what added to the delight was, to see the
hundreds taken by the drag, out of which, the cook standing by, we
pointed out what we had most mind to, and had carp that would have been
worth at London twenty shillings a piece.The waters are flagged about
with _Calamus aromaticus_, with which my lady has hung a closet, that
retains the smell very perfectly.There is also a certain sweet willow
and other exotics: also a very fine bowling-green, meadow, pasture, and
wood; in a word, all that can render a country seat delightful.There is
besides a well-furnished library in the house.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th October, 1685.We returned to London, having been treated with all
sorts of cheer and noble freedom by that most religious and virtuous
lady.She was now preparing to go for Ireland with her husband, made
Lord Deputy, and went to this country house and ancient seat of her
father and family, to set things in order during her absence; but never
were good people and neighbors more concerned than all the country (the
poor especially) for the departure of this charitable woman; everyone
was in tears, and she as unwilling to part from them.There was among
them a maiden of primitive life, the daughter of a poor laboring man,
who had sustained her parents (some time since dead) by her labor, and
has for many years refused marriage, or to receive any assistance from
the parish, besides the little hermitage my lady gives her rent-free;
she lives on four pence a day, which she gets by spinning; says she
abounds and can give alms to others, living in great humility and
content, without any apparent affectation, or singularity; she is
continually working, praying, or reading, gives a good account of her
knowledge in religion, visits the sick; is not in the least given to
talk; very modest, of a simple not unseemingly behavior; of a comely
countenance, clad very plain, but clean and tight.In sum, she appears a
saint of an extraordinary sort, in so religious a life, as is seldom met
with in villages now-a-days.I was invited to dine at Sir Stephen Fox's with my
Lord Lieutenant, where was such a dinner for variety of all things as I
had seldom seen, and it was so for the trial of a master-cook whom Sir
Stephen had recommended to go with his Lordship into Ireland; there were
all the dainties not only of the season, but of what art could add,
venison, plain solid meat, fowl, baked and boiled meats, banquet
[dessert], in exceeding plenty, and exquisitely dressed.There also
dined my Lord Ossory and Lady (the Duke of Beaufort's daughter), my Lady
Treasurer, Lord Cornbury, and other visitors.At the Royal Society, an urn full of bones was
presented, dug up in a highway, while repairing it, in a field in
Camberwell, in Surrey; it was found entire with its cover, among many
others, believed to be truly Roman and ancient.Sir Richard Bulkeley described to us a model of a chariot he had
invented, which it was not possible to overthrow in whatever uneven way
it was drawn, giving us a wonderful relation of what it had performed in
that kind, for ease, expedition, and safety; there were some
inconveniences yet to be remedied--it would not contain more than one
person; was ready to take fire every ten miles; and being placed and
playing on no fewer than ten rollers, it made a most prodigious noise,
almost intolerable.A remedy was to be sought for these inconveniences.I dined at our great Lord Chancellor Jefferies', who
used me with much respect.This was the late Chief-Justice who had newly
been the Western Circuit to try the Monmouth conspirators, and had
formerly done such severe justice among the obnoxious in Westminster
Hall, for which his Majesty dignified him by creating him first a Baron,
and now Lord Chancellor.He had some years past been conversant in
Deptford; is of an assured and undaunted spirit, and has served the
Court interest on all the hardiest occasions; is of nature cruel, and a
slave of the Court.The French persecution of the Protestants raging
with the utmost barbarity, exceeded even what the very heathens used:
innumerable persons of the greatest birth and riches leaving all their
earthly substance, and hardly escaping with their lives, dispersed
through all the countries of Europe.The French tyrant abrogated the
Edict of Nantes which had been made in favor of them, and without any
cause; on a sudden demolishing all their churches, banishing,
imprisoning, and sending to the galleys all the ministers; plundering
the common people, and exposing them to all sorts of barbarous usage by
soldiers sent to ruin and prey on them; taking away their children;
forcing people to the Mass, and then executing them as relapsers; they
burnt their libraries, pillaged their goods, ate up their fields and
substance, banished or sent the people to the galleys, and seized on
their estates.There had now been numbered to pass through Geneva only
(and that by stealth, for all the usual passages were strictly guarded
by sea and land) 40,000 toward Switzerland.In Holland, Denmark, and all
about Germany, were dispersed some hundred thousands; besides those in
England, where, though multitudes of all degree sought for shelter and
welcome as distressed Christians and confessors, they found least
encouragement, by a fatality of the times we were fallen into, and the
uncharitable indifference of such as should have embraced them; and I
prey it be not laid to our charge.The famous Claude fled to Holland;
Allix and several more came to London, and persons of great estates came
over, who had forsaken all.France was almost dispeopled, the bankers so
broken, that the tyrant's revenue was exceedingly diminished,
manufactures ceased, and everybody there, save the Jesuits, abhorred
what was done, nor did the <DW7>s themselves approve it.What the
further intention is, time will show; but doubtless portending some
revolution.I was shown the harangue which the Bishop of Valentia on Rhone made in
the name of the Clergy, celebrating the French King, as if he was a God,
for persecuting the poor Protestants, with this expression in it, "That
as his victory over heresy was greater than all the conquests of
Alexander and Caesar, it was but what was wished in England; and that God
seemed to raise the French King to this power and magnanimous action,
that he might be in capacity to assist in doing the same here."This
paragraph is very bold and remarkable; several reflecting on Archbishop
Usher's prophecy as now begun in France, and approaching the orthodox in
all other reformed churches.One thing was much taken notice of, that
the "Gazettes" which were still constantly printed twice a week,
informing us what was done all over Europe, never spoke of this
wonderful proceeding in France; nor was any relation of it published by
any, save what private letters and the persecuted fugitives brought.Whence this silence, I list not to conjecture; but it appeared very
extraordinary in a Protestant country that we should know nothing of
what Protestants suffered, while great collections were made for them in
foreign places, more hospitable and Christian to appearance.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1685.It being an extraordinarily wet morning, and myself
indisposed by a very great rheum, I did not go to church, to my very
great sorrow, it being the first Gunpowder Conspiracy anniversary that
had been kept now these eighty years under a prince of the Roman
religion.Bonfires were forbidden on this day; what does this portend!The King in his speech
required continuance of a standing force instead of a militia, and
indemnity and dispensation to Popish officers from the Test; demands
very unexpected and unpleasing to the Commons.He also required a supply
of revenue, which they granted; but returned no thanks to the King for
his speech, till farther consideration.The Commons postponed finishing the bill for the
Supply, to consider the Test, and Popish officers; this was carried but
by one voice.I dined at Lambeth, my Lord Archbishop carrying me
with him in his barge; there were my Lord Deputy of Ireland, the Bishops
of Ely and St.Sherlock, and other divines; Sir William
Hayward, Sir Paul Rycaut, etc.The Parliament was adjourned to February, several
both of Lords and Commons excepting against some passage of his
Majesty's speech relating to the Test, and continuance of Popish
officers in command.This was a great surprise in a Parliament which
people believed would have complied in all things.Popish pamphlets and pictures sold publicly; no books nor answers to
them appearing till long after.I resigned my trust for composing a difference
between Mr.Hitherto was a very wet, warm season.Lord Sunderland was declared President of the
Council, and yet to hold his Secretary's place.The forces disposed into
several quarters through the kingdom are very insolent, on which are
great complaints.Lord Brandon, tried for the late conspiracy, was condemned and pardoned;
so was Lord Grey, his accuser and witness.Persecution in France raging, the French insolently visit our vessels,
and take away the fugitive Protestants; some escape in barrels.[Sidenote: GREENWICH]

10th December, 1685.To Greenwich, being put into the new Commission of
Sewers.Patrick, Dean of Peterborough, preached at
Whitehall, before the Princess of Denmark, who, since his Majesty came
to the Crown, always sat in the King's closet, and had the same bowings
and ceremonies applied to the place where she was, as his Majesty had
when there in person.Slayer showed us an experiment of a wonderful
nature, pouring first a very cold liquor into a glass, and superfusing
on it another, to appearance cold and clear liquor also; it first
produced a white cloud, then boiling, divers coruscations and actual
flames of fire mingled with the liquor, which being a little shaken
together, fixed divers suns and stars of real fire, perfectly globular,
on the sides of the glass, and which there stuck like so many
constellations, burning most vehemently, and resembling stars and
heavenly bodies, and that for a long space.It seemed to exhibit a
theory of the eduction of light out of the chaos, and the fixing or
gathering of the universal light into luminous bodies.This matter, or
phosphorus, was made out of human blood and urine, elucidating the vital
flame, or heat in animal bodies.I accompanied my Lord-Lieutenant as far as St.Alban's, there going out of town with him near 200 coaches of all the
great officers and nobility.The next morning taking leave, I returned
to London.I dined at the great entertainment his Majesty gave
the Venetian Ambassadors, Signors Zenno and Justiniani, accompanied with
ten more noble Venetians of their most illustrious families, Cornaro,
Maccenigo, etc., who came to congratulate their Majesties coming to the
Crown.The dinner was most magnificent and plentiful, at four tables,
with music, kettledrums, and trumpets, which sounded upon a whistle at
every health.The banquet [dessert] was twelve vast chargers piled up so
high that those who sat one against another could hardly see each other.Of these sweetmeats, which doubtless were some days piling up in that
exquisite manner, the Ambassadors touched not, but leaving them to the
spectators who came out of curiosity to see the dinner, were exceedingly
pleased to see in what a moment of time all that curious work was
demolished, the comfitures voided, and the tables cleared.Thus his
Majesty entertained them three days, which (for the table only) cost him
L600, as the Clerk of the Greencloth (Sir William Boreman) assured me.Dinner ended, I saw their procession, or cavalcade, to Whitehall,
innumerable coaches attending.The two Ambassadors had four coaches of
their own, and fifty footmen (as I remember), besides other equipage as
splendid as the occasion would permit, the Court being still in
mourning.Thence, I went to the audience which they had in the Queen's
presence chamber, the Banqueting House being full of goods and furniture
till the galleries on the garden-side, council chamber, and new chapel,
now in the building, were finished.They went to their audience in those
plain black gowns and caps which they constantly wear in the city of
Venice.I was invited to have accompanied the two Ambassadors in their
coach to supper that night, returning now to their own lodgings, as no
longer at the King's expense; but, being weary, I excused myself.My Lord Treasurer made me dine with him, where I
became acquainted with Monsieur Barillon, the French Ambassador, a
learned and crafty advocate.[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th December, 1685.Turner, brother to the Bishop of Ely, and
sometime tutor to my son, preached at Whitehall on Mark viii.38,
concerning the submission of Christians to their persecutors, in which
were some passages indiscreet enough, considering the time, and the rage
of the inhuman French tyrant against the poor Protestants.Our patent for executing the office of Privy Seal
during the absence of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, being this day
sealed by the Lord Chancellor, we went afterward to St.James, where the
Court then was on occasion of building at Whitehall; his Majesty
delivered the seal to my Lord Tiviot and myself, the other Commissioners
not being come, and then gave us his hand to kiss.There were the two
Venetian Ambassadors and a world of company; among the rest the first
Popish Nuncio that had been in England since the Reformation; so
wonderfully were things changed, to the universal jealousy.We were all three Commissioners sworn on our knees
by the Clerk of the Crown, before my Lord Chancellor, three several
oaths: allegiance, supremacy, and the oath belonging to the Lord Privy
Seal, which last we took standing.After this, the Lord Chancellor
invited us all to dinner, but it being Christmas eve we desired to be
excused, intending at three in the afternoon to seal divers things which
lay ready at the office; so attended by three of the Clerks of the
Signet, we met and sealed.Among other things was a pardon to West, who
being privy to the late conspiracy, had revealed the accomplices to save
his own neck.There were also another pardon and two indenizations; and
so agreeing to a fortnight's vacation, I returned home.Recollecting the passages of the year past, and
having made up accounts, humbly besought Almighty God to pardon those my
sins which had provoked him to discompose my sorrowful family; that he
would accept of our humiliation, and in his good time restore comfort to
it.I also blessed God for all his undeserved mercies and preservations,
begging the continuance of his grace and preservation.The winter had
hitherto been extraordinarily wet and mild.Imploring the continuance of God's providential
care for the year now entered, I went to the public devotions.The Dean
of the Chapel and Clerk of the Closet put out, viz, Bishop of London and
..., and Rochester and Durham put in their places; the former had
opposed the toleration intended, and shown a worthy zeal for the
reformed religion as established.I dined with the Archbishop of York, where was Peter
Walsh, that Romish priest so well known for his moderation, professing
the Church of England to be a true member of the Catholic Church.He is
used to go to our public prayers without scruple, and did not
acknowledge the Pope's infallibility, only primacy of order.Passed the Privy Seal, among others, the creation of
Mrs.Sedley (concubine to ----) Countess of Dorchester, which the Queen
took very grievously, so as for two dinners, standing near her, I
observed she hardly ate one morsel, nor spoke one word to the King, or
to any about her, though at other times she used to be extremely
pleasant, full of discourse and good humor.The Roman Catholics were
also very angry: because they had so long valued the sanctity of their
religion and proselytes.Dryden, the famous playwriter, and his two sons, and Mrs.Nelly (miss to
the late ----), were said to go to mass; such proselytes were no great
loss to the Church.This night was burnt to the ground my Lord Montague's palace in
Bloomsbury, than which for painting and furniture there was nothing more
glorious in England.This happened by the negligence of a servant
airing, as they call it, some of the goods by the fire in a moist
season; indeed, so wet and mild a season had scarce been seen in man's
memory.At this Seal there also passed the creation of Sir Henry Waldegrave to
be a Peer.He had married one of the King's natural daughters by Mrs.These two Seals my brother Commissioners passed in the
morning before I came to town, at which I was not displeased.We
likewise passed Privy Seals for L276,000 upon several accounts,
pensions, guards, wardrobes, privy purse, etc., besides divers pardons,
and one more which I must not forget (and which by Providence I was not
present at) one Mr.Lytcott to be Secretary to the Ambassador to Rome.We being three Commissioners, any two were a quorum.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st January, 1686.I dined at my Lady Arlington's, Groom of the Stole
to the Queen Dowager, at Somerset House, where dined the Countesses of
Devonshire, Dover, etc.; in all eleven ladies of quality, no man but
myself being there.Unheard-of cruelties to the persecuted Protestants
of France, such as hardly any age has seen the like, even among the
Pagans.Being the day on which his Majesty began his reign,
by order of Council it was to be solemnized with a particular office and
sermon, which the Bishop of Ely preached at Whitehall on Numb.12; a
Court oration upon the regal office.It was much wondered at, that this
day, which was that of his late Majesty's death, should be kept as a
festival, and not the day of the present King's coronation.It is said
to have been formerly the custom, though not till now since the reign of
King James I.

The Duchess of Monmouth, being in the same seat with me at church,
appeared with a very sad and afflicted countenance.I took the test in Westminster Hall, before the Lord
Chief Justice.I now came to lodge at Whitehall, in the Lord Privy
Seal's lodgings.My great cause was heard by my Lord Chancellor, who
granted me a rehearing.I had six eminent lawyers, my antagonist three,
whereof one was the smooth-tongued solicitor, whom my Lord Chancellor
reproved in great passion for a very small occasion.Blessed be God for
his great goodness to me this day!Many bloody and notorious duels were fought about
this time.Stanley, brother to the Earl
of [Derby], indeed upon an almost insufferable provocation.It is to be
hoped that his Majesty will at last severely remedy this unchristian
custom.Lord Sunderland was now Secretary of State, President of the Council,
and Premier Minister.Came Sir Gilbert Gerrard to treat with me about his
son's marrying my daughter, Susanna.The father being obnoxious, and in
some suspicion and displeasure of the King, I would receive no proposal
till his Majesty had given me leave; which he was pleased to do; but,
after several meetings we broke off, on his not being willing to secure
anything competent for my daughter's children; besides that I found most
of his estate was in the coal-pits as far off as Newcastle, and on
leases from the Bishop of Durham, who had power to make concurrent
leases, with other difficulties.Frampton, Bishop of Gloucester, preached on Psalm
xliv.17, 18, 19, showing the several afflictions of the Church of
Christ from the primitive to this day, applying exceedingly to the
present conjuncture, when many were wavering in their minds, and great
temptations appearing through the favor now found by the <DW7>s, so as
the people were full of jealousies and discouragement.The Bishop
magnified the Church of England, exhorting to constancy and
perseverance.A Council of the Royal Society about disposing of Dr.Ray's book of Fishes, which was printed at the expense of the Society.A docket was to be sealed, importing a lease of
twenty-one years to one Hall, who styled himself his Majesty's printer
(he lately turned <DW7>) for the printing missals, offices, lives of
saints, portals, primers, etc., books expressly forbidden to be printed
or sold, by divers Acts of Parliament; I refused to put my seal to it,
making my exceptions, so it was laid by.The Bishop of Bath and Wells preached on John vi.17,
a most excellent and pathetic discourse: after he had recommended the
duty of fasting and other penitential duties, he exhorted to constancy
in the Protestant religion, detestation of the unheard-of cruelties of
the French, and stirring up to a liberal contribution.This sermon was
the more acceptable, as it was unexpected from a Bishop who had
undergone the censure of being inclined to Popery, the contrary whereof
no man could show more.This indeed did all our Bishops, to the
disabusing and reproach of all their delators: for none were more
zealous against Popery than they were.I was at a review of the army about London in Hyde
Park, about 6,000 horse and foot, in excellent order; his Majesty and
infinity of people being present.I went to my house in the country, refusing to be
present at what was to pass at the Privy Seal the next day.Tenison preached an incomparable discourse at Whitehall, on
Timothy ii.Cradock (Provost of Eaton) preached at the same
place, on Psalm xlix.13, showing the vanity of earthly enjoyments.White, Bishop of Peterborough, preached in a very
eloquent style, on Matthew xxvi.29, submission to the will of God on
all accidents, and at all times.The Duke of Northumberland (a natural son of the late
King by the Duchess of Cleveland) marrying very meanly, with the help of
his brother Grafton, attempted in vain to spirit away his wife.A Brief was read in all churches for relieving the French Protestants,
who came here for protection from the unheard-of cruelties of the King.Sir Edward Hales, a <DW7>, made Governor of Dover
Castle.The Archbishop of York now died of the smallpox, aged
62, a corpulent man.He was my special loving friend, and while Bishop
of Rochester (from whence he was translated) my excellent neighbor.He
was an inexpressible loss to the whole church, and that Province
especially, being a learned, wise, stout, and most worthy prelate; I
look on this as a great stroke to the poor Church of England, now in
this defecting period.In the afternoon I went to Camberwell, to visit Dr.After sermon, I accompanied him to his house, where he showed me
the Life and Letters of the late learned Primate of Armagh (Usher), and
among them that letter of Bishop Bramhall's to the Primate, giving
notice of the Popish practices to pervert this nation, by sending a
hundred priests into England, who were to conform themselves to all
sectaries and conditions for the more easily dispersing their doctrine
among us.This letter was the cause of the whole impression being
seized, upon pretense that it was a political or historical account of
things not relating to theology, though it had been licensed by the
Bishop; which plainly showed what an interest the <DW7>s now had,--that
a Protestant book, containing the life and letters of so eminent a man,
was not to be published.There were also many letters to and from most
of the learned persons his correspondents in Europe.The book will, I
doubt not, struggle through this unjust impediment.Several Judges were put out, and new complying ones put in.This day was read in our church the Brief for a
collection for relief of the Protestant French so cruelly, barbarously,
and inhumanly oppressed without any thing being laid to their charge.It
had been long expected, and at last with difficulty procured to be
published, the interest of the French Ambassador obstructing it.There being a Seal, it was feared we should be required
to pass a docket dispensing with Dr.Obadiah Walker and four more,
whereof one was an apostate curate of Putney, the others officers of
University College, Oxford, who hold their masterships, fellowships, and
cures, and keep public schools, and enjoy all former emoluments,
notwithstanding they no more frequented or used the public forms of
prayers, or communion, with the Church of England, or took the Test or
oaths of allegiance and supremacy, contrary to twenty Acts of
Parliament; which dispensation being also contrary to his Majesty's own
gracious declaration at the beginning of his reign, gave umbrage (as
well it might) to every good Protestant; nor could we safely have passed
it under the Privy Seal, wherefore it was done by immediate warrant,
signed by Mr.This Walker was a learned person, of a monkish life, to whose tuition I
had more than thirty years since recommended the sons of my worthy
friend, Mr.Hyldyard, of Horsley in Surrey, believing him to be far from
what he proved--a hypocritical concealed <DW7>--by which he perverted
the eldest son of Mr.Hyldyard, Sir Edward Hale's eldest son, and
several more, to the great disturbance of the whole nation, as well as
of the University, as by his now public defection appeared.All engines
being now at work to bring in Popery, which God in mercy prevent![Sidenote: LONDON]

This day was burned in the old Exchange, by the common hangman, a
translation of a book written by the famous Monsieur Claude, relating
only matters of fact concerning the horrid massacres and barbarous
proceedings of the French King against his Protestant subjects, without
any refutation of any facts therein; so mighty a power and ascendant
here had the French Ambassador, who was doubtless in great indignation
at the pious and truly generous charity of all the nation, for the
relief of those miserable sufferers who came over for shelter.About this time also, the Duke of Savoy, instigated by the French King
to extirpate the Protestants of Piedmont, slew many thousands of those
innocent people, so that there seemed to be an universal design to
destroy all that would not go to mass, throughout Europe._Quod Avertat
D. O.M.!_ No faith in Princes!I refused to put the Privy Seal to Doctor Walker's
license for printing and publishing divers Popish books, of which I
complained both to my Lord of Canterbury (with whom I went to advise in
the Council Chamber), and to my Lord Treasurer that evening at his
lodgings.My Lord of Canterbury's advice was, that I should follow my
own conscience therein; Mr.Treasurer's, that if in conscience I could
dispense with it, for any other hazard he believed there was none.Notwithstanding this, I persisted in my refusal.There was no sermon on this anniversary, as there
usually had been ever since the reign of the present King.Such storms, rain, and foul weather, seldom known at this
time of the year.The camp at Hounslow Heath, from sickness and other
inconveniences of weather, forced to retire to quarters; the storms
being succeeded by excessive hot weather, many grew sick.Great feasting
there, especially in Lord Dunbarton's quarters.There were many
jealousies and discourses of what was the meaning of this encampment.A seal this day; mostly pardons and discharges of Knight Baronets'
fees, which having been passed over for so many years, did greatly
disoblige several families who had served his Majesty.Lord Tyrconnel
gone to Ireland, with great powers and commissions, giving as much cause
of talk as the camp, especially nineteen new Privy-Councillors and
Judges being now made, among which but three Protestants, and Tyrconnel
made General.New judges also here, among which was Milton, a <DW7> (brother to that
Milton who wrote for the Regicides), who presumed to take his place
without passing the Test.Scotland refused to grant liberty of mass to
the <DW7>s there.The Protestants in Savoy
successfully resist the French dragoons sent to murder them.The King's chief physician in Scotland apostatizing from the Protestant
religion, does of his own accord publish his recantation at Edinburg.I went to see Middleton's receptacle of water at the
New River, and the New Spa Wells near.My Lord Treasurer settled my great business with Mr.Pretyman, to which I hope God will at last give a prosperous issue.Sharp and Tully,
proceeded to silence and suspend divers excellent divines for preaching
against Popery.I had this day been married thirty-nine years--blessed
be God for all his mercies!The new very young Lord Chief-Justice Herbert declared on the bench,
that the government of England was entirely in the King; that the Crown
was absolute; that penal laws were powers lodged in the Crown to enable
the King to force the execution of the law, but were not bars to bind
the King's power; that he could pardon all offenses against the law, and
forgive the penalties, and why could he not dispense with them; by which
the Test was abolished?Great jealousies as to
what would be the end of these proceedings.I supped with the Countess of Rochester, where was also
the Duchess of Buckingham and Madame de Governe, whose daughter was
married to the Marquis of Halifax's son.She made me a character of the
French King and Dauphin, and of the persecution; that they kept much of
the cruelties from the King's knowledge; that the Dauphin was so afraid
of his father, that he dared not let anything appear of his sentiments;
that he hated letters and priests, spent all his time in hunting, and
seemed to take no notice of what was passing.This lady was of a great family and fortune, and had fled hither for
refuge.I waited on the Archbishop at Lambeth, where I dined and
met the famous preacher and writer, Dr.Allix, doubtless a most
excellent and learned person.The Archbishop and he spoke Latin
together, and that very readily.Meggot, Dean of Winchester preached before the
household in St.George's Chapel at Windsor, the late King's glorious
chapel now seized on by the mass priests.Cartwright, Dean of Ripon,
preached before the great men of the Court in the same place.We had now the sad news of the Bishop of Oxford's death, an
extraordinary loss to the poor Church at this time.Many candidates for
his Bishopric and Deanery, Dr.Parker, South, Aldrich, etc.Walker
(now apostatizing) came to Court, and was doubtless very busy.Note, that standing by the Queen at basset (cards), I
observed that she was exceedingly concerned for the loss of L80; her
outward affability much changed to stateliness, since she has been
exalted.The season very rainy and inconvenient for the camps.Was sealed at our office the constitution of certain
commissioners to take upon them full power of all Ecclesiastical
affairs, in as unlimited a manner, or rather greater, than the late High
Commission-Court, abrogated by Parliament; for it had not only faculty
to inspect and visit all Bishops' dioceses, but to change what laws and
statutes they should think fit to alter among the colleges, though
founded by private men; to punish, suspend, fine, etc., give oaths and
call witnesses.The main drift was to suppress zealous preachers.In
sum, it was the whole power of a Vicar-General--note the consequence!Of
the clergy the commissioners were the Archbishop of Canterbury
[Sancroft], Bishop of Durham [Crewe], and Rochester [Sprat]; of the
Temporals, the Lord Treasurer, the Lord Chancellor [Jefferies] (who
alone was ever to be of the quorum), the Chief justice [Herbert], and
Lord President [Earl of Sunderland].I went to see Sir John Chardin, at Greenwich.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th August, 1686.I dined at Signor Verrio's, the famous Italian
painter, now settled in his Majesty's garden at St.James's, which he
had made a very delicious paradise.Our vicar gone to dispose of his country living in
Rutlandshire, having St.Dunstan in the east given him by the Archbishop
of Canterbury.I went to visit the Marquis Ravigne, now my neighbor at Greenwich,
retired from the persecution in France.He was the deputy of all the
Protestants of that kingdom in the parliament of Paris, and several
times Ambassador in this and other Courts; a person of great learning
and experience.Compton, Bishop of London, was on Monday
suspended, on pretense of not silencing Dr.Giles's, for
something of a sermon in which he zealously reproved the doctrine of the
Roman Catholics.The Bishop having consulted the civilians, they told
him he could not by any law proceed against Dr.Sharp without producing
witnesses, and impleaded according to form; but it was overruled by my
Lord Chancellor, and the Bishop sentenced without so much as being heard
to any purpose.This was thought a very extraordinary way of proceeding,
and was universally resented, and so much the rather for that two
Bishops, Durham and Rochester, sitting in the commission and giving
their suffrages the Archbishop of Canterbury refused to sit among them.He was only suspended _ab officio_, and that was soon after taken off.He was brother to the Earl of Northampton, had once been a soldier, had
traveled in Italy, but became a sober, grave, and excellent prelate.Buda now taken from the Turks; a form of
thanksgiving was ordered to be used in the (as yet remaining) Protestant
chapels and church of Whitehall and Windsor.The King of Denmark was besieging Hamburg, no doubt by the French
contrivance, to embroil the Protestant Princes in a new war, that
Holland, etc., being engaged, matter for new quarrel might arise: the
unheard-of persecution of the poor Protestants still raging more than
ever.The Danes retire from Hamburg, the Protestant
Princes appearing for their succor, and the Emperor sending his
minatories to the King of Denmark, and also requiring the restoration of
the Duke of Saxe Gotha.Thus it pleased God to defeat the French
designs, which were evidently to kindle a new war.His Majesty's birthday; I was at his rising in his
bedchamber, afterward in the park, where four companies of guards were
drawn up.The officers, etc., wonderfully rich and gallant; they did not
head their troops, but their next officers, the colonels being on
horseback by the King while they marched.The ladies not less splendid
at Court, where there was a ball at night; but small appearance of
quality.All the shops both in the city and suburbs were shut up, and
kept as solemnly as any holiday.Bonfires at night in Westminster, but
forbidden in the city.Patrick, Dean of Peterborough, preached at
Covent Garden Church on Ephes.18, 19, showing the custom of the
primitive saints in serving God with hymns, and their frequent use of
them upon all occasions: touching the profane way of mirth and
intemperance of this ungodly age.Afterward I visited my Lord Chief
Justice of Ireland, with whom I had long and private discourse
concerning the miserable condition that kingdom was like to be in, if
Tyrconnel's counsel should prevail at Court.Went with the Countess of Sunderland to Cranbourne,
a lodge and walk of my Lord Godolphin's in Windsor park.There was one
room in the house spared in the pulling down the old one, because the
late Duchess of York was born in it; the rest was built and added to it
by Sir George Carteret, Treasurer of the Navy; and since, the whole was
purchased by my Lord Godolphin, who spoke to me to go see it, and advise
what trees were fit to be cut down to improve the dwelling, being
environed with old rotten pollards, which corrupt the air.It stands on
a knoll which though insensibly rising, gives it a prospect over the
Keep of Windsor, about three miles N. E. of it.The ground is clayey and
moist; the water stark naught; the park is pretty; the house tolerable,
and gardens convenient.After dinner, we came back to London, having two
coaches both going and coming, of six horses apiece, which we changed at
Hounslow.Warren preached before the Princess at
Whitehall, on 5th Matthew, of the blessedness of the pure in heart, most
elegantly describing the bliss of the beatifical vision.In the
afternoon, Sir George Wheeler, knight and baronet, preached on the 4th
Matt.Margaret's, an honest and
devout discourse, and pretty tolerably performed.This gentleman coming
from his travels out of Greece, fell in love with the daughter of Sir
Thomas Higgins, his Majesty's resident at Venice, niece to the Earl of
Bath, and married her.When they returned into England, being honored
with knighthood, he would needs turn preacher, and took orders.He
published a learned and ingenious book of his travels, and is a very
worthy person, a little formal and particular, but exceedingly devout.There was a triumphant show of the Lord Mayor both
by land and water, with much solemnity, when yet his power has been so
much diminished, by the loss of the city's former charter.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1686.Birch preached very boldly against the <DW7>s, from John xvi.Tillotson in Lincoln's Inn chapel, on the same
text, but more cautiously.I went with part of my family to pass the
melancholy winter in London at my son's house in Arundel Buildings.I dined at my Lady Arlington's, Groom of the Stole
to the Queen Dowager at Somerset House, where dined divers French
noblemen, driven out of their country by the persecution.I carried the Countess of Sunderland to see the
rarities of one Mr.Charlton in the Middle Temple, who showed us such a
collection as I had never seen in all my travels abroad either of
private gentlemen, or princes.It consisted of miniatures, drawings,
shells, insects, medals, natural things, animals (of which divers, I
think 100, were kept in glasses of spirits of wine), minerals, precious
stones, vessels, curiosities in amber, crystal, agate, etc.; all being
very perfect and rare of their kind, especially his books of birds,
fish, flowers, and shells, drawn and miniatured to the life.He told us
that one book stood him in L300; it was painted by that excellent
workman, whom the late Gaston, Duke of Orleans, employed.This
gentleman's whole collection, gathered by himself, traveling over most
parts of Europe, is estimated at L8,000.He appeared to be a modest and
obliging person.[62]

    [Footnote 62: This collection was afterward purchased by Sir Hans
    Sloane, and now forms part oL the British Museum.][Sidenote: LONDON]

29th December, 1686.I went to hear the music of the Italians in the
new chapel, now first opened publicly at Whitehall for the Popish
Service.Nothing can be finer than the magnificent marble work and
architecture at the end, where are four statues, representing St.Paul, and the Church, in white marble, the work of Mr.Gibbons, with all the carving and pillars of exquisite art and great
cost.The altar piece is the Salutation; the volto in _fresco_, the
Assumption of the blessed Virgin, according to their tradition, with our
blessed Savior, and a world of figures painted by Verrio.The throne
where the King and Queen sit is very glorious, in a closet above, just
opposite to the altar.Here we saw the Bishop in his mitre and rich
copes, with six or seven Jesuits and others in rich copes, sumptuously
habited, often taking off and putting on the Bishop's mitre, who sat in
a chair with arms pontifically, was adored and censed by three Jesuits
in their copes; then he went to the altar and made divers cringes, then
censing the images and glorious tabernacle placed on the altar, and now
and then changing place: the crosier, which was of silver, was put into
his hand with a world of mysterious ceremony, the music playing, with
singing.I could not have believed I should ever have seen such things
in the King of England's palace, after it had pleased God to enlighten
this nation; but our great sin has, for the present, eclipsed the
blessing, which I hope he will in mercy and his good time restore to its
purity.He wrote excellently, in answer
to the Bishop of Meaux.A Seal to confirm a gift of L4,000 per annum for 99
years to the Lord Treasurer out of the Post Office, and L1,700 per annum
for ever out of Lord Grey's estate.There was now another change of the great officers.The Treasury was put
into commission, two professed <DW7>s among them, viz, Lords Bellasis
and Dover, joined with the old ones, Lord Godolphin, Sir Stephen Fox,
and Sir John Ernley.Much expectation of several great men declaring
themselves <DW7>s.Lord Tyrconnel gone to succeed the Lord-Lieutenant
[Clarendon] in Ireland, to the astonishment of all sober men, and to the
evident ruin of the Protestants in that kingdom, as well as of its great
improvement going on.Much discourse that all the White Staff officers
and others should be dismissed for adhering to their religion.Popish
Justices of the Peace established in all counties, of the meanest of the
people; Judges ignorant of the law, and perverting it--so furiously do
the Jesuits drive, and even compel Princes to violent courses, and
destruction of an excellent government both in Church and State.God of
his infinite mercy open our eyes, and turn our hearts, and establish his
truth with peace!The Lord Jesus defend his little flock, and preserve
this threatened church and nation!I saw the Queen's new apartment at Whitehall, with
her new bed, the embroidery of which cost L3,000.The carving about the
chimney piece, by Gibbons, is incomparable.I heard the famous eunuch, Cifaccio, sing in the new
Popish chapel this afternoon; it was indeed very rare, and with great
skill.He came over from Rome, esteemed one of the best voices in Italy.Chetwin preached at Whitehall on Rom.18, a
very quaint, neat discourse of Moral righteousness.Came out a proclamation for universal liberty of
conscience in Scotland, and depensation from all tests and laws to the
contrary, as also capacitating <DW7>s to be chosen into all offices of
trust.Meggott, Dean of Winchester, preached before the
Princess of Denmark, on Matt.In the afternoon, I went out of
town to meet my Lord Clarendon, returning from Ireland.His Majesty sent for the Commissioners of the Privy
Seal this morning into his bedchamber, and told us that though he had
thought fit to dispose of the Seal into a single hand, yet he would so
provide for us, as it should appear how well he accepted our faithful
and loyal service with many gracious expressions to this effect; upon
which we delivered the Seal into his hands.It was by all the world both
hoped and expected, that he would have restored it to my Lord Clarendon;
but they were astonished to see it given to Lord Arundel, of Wardour, a
zealous Roman Catholic.Indeed it was very hard, and looked very
unkindly, his Majesty (as my Lord Clarendon protested to me, on my going
to visit him and long discoursing with him about the affairs of Ireland)
finding not the least failure of duty in him during his government of
that kingdom, so that his recall plainly appeared to be from the
stronger influence of the <DW7>s, who now got all the preferments.Most of the great officers, both in the Court and country, Lords and
others, were dismissed, as they would not promise his Majesty their
consent to the repeal of the test and penal statutes against Popish
Recusants.To this end, most of the Parliament men were spoken to in his
Majesty's closet, and such as refused, if in any place of office or
trust, civil or military, were put out of their employments.This was a
time of great trial; but hardly one of them assented, which put the
Popish interest much backward.The English clergy everywhere preached
boldly against their superstition and errors, and were wonderfully
followed by the people.Not one considerable proselyte was made in all
this time.The party were exceedingly put to the worst by the preaching
and writing of the Protestants in many excellent treatises, evincing the
doctrine and discipline of the reformed religion, to the manifest
disadvantage of their adversaries.To this did not a little contribute
the sermon preached at Whitehall before the Princess of Denmark and a
great crowd of people, and at least thirty of the greatest nobility, by
Dr.Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells, on John viii.46 (the Gospel of the
day), describing through his whole discourse the blasphemies, perfidy,
wresting of Scripture, preference of tradition before it, spirit of
persecution, superstition, legends, and fables of the Scribes and
Pharisees, so that all the auditory understood his meaning of a parallel
between them and the Romish priests, and their new Trent religion.He
exhorted his audience to adhere to the written Word, and to persevere in
the Faith taught in the Church of England, whose doctrine for Catholic
and soundness he preferred to all the communities and churches of
Christians in the world; concluding with a kind of prophecy, that
whatever it suffered, it should after a short trial emerge to the
confusion of her adversaries and the glory of God.I went this evening to see the order of the boys and children at
Christ's Hospital.There were near 800 boys and girls so decently clad,
cleanly lodged, so wholesomely fed, so admirably taught, some the
mathematics, especially the forty of the late King's foundation, that I
was delighted to see the progress some little youths of thirteen or
fourteen years of age had made.I saw them at supper, visited their
dormitories, and much admired the order, economy, and excellent
government of this most charitable seminary.Some are taught for the
Universities, others designed for seamen, all for trades and callings.The girls are instructed in all such work as becomes their sex and may
fit them for good wives, mistresses, and to be a blessing to their
generation.They sang a psalm before they sat down to supper in the
great Hall, to an organ which played all the time, with such cheerful
harmony, that it seemed to me a vision of angels.I came from the place
with infinite satisfaction, having never seen a more noble, pious, and
admirable charity.[63] The
foundation was of that pious Prince King Edward VI., whose picture (held
to be an original of Holbein) is in the court where the Governors meet
to consult on the affairs of the Hospital, and his statue in white
marble stands in a niche of the wall below, as you go to the church,
which is a modern, noble, and ample fabric.This foundation has had, and
still has, many benefactors.[Footnote 63: This is by no means the case now.]I saw a trial of those devilish, murdering, mischief
doing engines called bombs, shot out of the mortar piece on Blackheath.The distance that they are cast, the destruction they make where they
fall, is prodigious.Martin's to a crowd of people not to be expressed, nor the wonderful
eloquence of this admirable preacher; the text was Matt.36 to
verse 40, describing the bitterness of our Blessed Savior's agony, the
ardor of his love, the infinite obligations we have to imitate his
patience and resignation; the means by watching against temptations, and
over ourselves with fervent prayer to attain it, and the exceeding
reward in the end.Upon all which he made most pathetical discourses.The Communion followed, at which I was participant.Tenison's with the Bishop and that young, most learned, pious, and
excellent preacher, Mr.In the afternoon, I went to hear Mr.Wake
at the newly built church of St.34, upon the
subject of taking up the cross, and strenuously behaving ourselves in
time of persecution, as this now threatened to be.His Majesty again prorogued the Parliament, foreseeing it would not
remit the laws against <DW7>s, by the extraordinary zeal and bravery of
its members, and the free renunciation of the great officers both in
Court and state, who would not be prevailed with for any temporal
concern.During the service, a man came into near the middle of the
church, with his sword drawn, with several others in that posture; in
this jealous time it put the congregation into great confusion, but it
appeared to be one who fled for sanctuary, being pursued by bailiffs.I had a rehearing of my great cause at the Chancery in
Westminster Hall, having seven of the most learned Counsel, my adversary
five, among which were the Attorney General and late Solicitor Finch,
son to the Lord Chancellor Nottingham.The account was at last brought
to one article of the surcharge, and referred to a Master.The cause
lasted two hours and more.In the last week there was issued a Dispensation from
all obligations and tests, by which Dissenters and <DW7>s especially
had public liberty of exercising their several ways of worship, without
incurring the penalty of the many Laws and Acts of Parliament to the
contrary.This was purely obtained by the <DW7>s, thinking thereby to
ruin the Church of England, being now the only church which so admirably
and strenuously opposed their superstition.There was a wonderful
concourse of people at the Dissenters' meeting house in this parish, and
the parish church [Deptford] left exceedingly thin.What this will end
in, God Almighty only knows; but it looks like confusion, which I pray
God avert.[Sidenote: LONDON]

11th April, 1687.To London about my suit, some terms of accommodation
being proposed.I heard the famous singer, Cifaccio, esteemed the best
in Europe.Indeed, his holding out and delicateness in extending and
loosing a note with incomparable softness and sweetness, was admirable;
for the rest I found him a mere wanton, effeminate child, very coy, and
proudly conceited, to my apprehension.He touched the harpsichord to his
voice rarely well.This was before a select number of particular persons
whom Mr.Pepys invited to his house; and this was obtained by particular
favor and much difficulty, the Signor much disdaining to show his talent
to any but princes.At Greenwich, at the conclusion of the Church service,
there was a French sermon preached after the use of the English Liturgy
translated into French, to a congregation of about 100 French refugees,
of whom Monsieur Ruvigny was the chief, and had obtained the use of the
church, after the parish service was ended.The preacher pathetically
exhorted to patience, constancy, and reliance on God amidst all their
sufferings, and the infinite rewards to come.I dined with Mynheer Diskvelts, the Holland Ambassador, a
prudent and worthy person.There dined Lord Middleton, principal
Secretary of State, Lord Pembroke, Lord Lumley, Lord Preston, Colonel
Fitzpatrick, and Sir John Chardin.After dinner, the Ambassador
discoursed of and deplored the stupid folly of our politics, in
suffering the French to take Luxemburg, it being a place of the most
concern to have been defended, for the interest not only of the
Netherlands, but of England.[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th May, 1687.Lord Sunderland being Lord President and
Secretary of State, was made Knight of the Garter and Prime favorite.This day there was such a storm of wind as had seldom happened, being a
sort of hurricane.It kept the flood out of the Thames, so that people
went on foot over several places above bridge.Also an earthquake in
several places in England about the time of the storm.Pretyman, after
my tedious suit.I went to London, it having pleased his Majesty to grant
me a Privy Seal for L6,000, for discharge of the debt I had been so many
years persecuted for, it being indeed for money drawn over by my
father-in-law, Sir R. Browne, during his residence in the Court of
France, and so with a much greater sum due to Sir Richard from his
Majesty; and now this part of the arrear being paid, there remains yet
due to me, as executor of Sir Richard, above L6,500 more; but this
determining an expensive Chancery suit has been so great a mercy and
providence to me (through the kindness and friendship to me of Lord
Godolphin, one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury,) that I do
acknowledge it with all imaginable thanks to my gracious God.I visited my Lady Pierpoint, daughter to Sir John
Evelyn, of Deane [in Wilts], now widow of Mr.Pierpoint, and mother of
the Earl of Kingston.She was now engaged in the marriage of my cousin,
Evelyn Pierpoint, her second son.There was about this time brought into the Downs a vast treasure, which
was sunk in a Spanish galleon about forty-five years ago, somewhere near
Hispaniola, or the Bahama islands, and was now weighed up by some
gentlemen, who were at the charge of divers, etc., to the enriching them
beyond all expectation.The Duke of Albemarle's share [Governor of
Jamaica] came to, I believe, L50,000.Some private gentlemen who
adventured L100, gained from L8,000 to L10,000.His Majesty's tenth was
L10,000.The Camp was now again pitched at Hounslow, the Commanders profusely
vying in the expense and magnificence of tents.21, upon the danger
of relapsing into sin.After this, I went and heard M. Lamot, an
eloquent French preacher at Greenwich, on Prov.8, 9, a consolatory
discourse to the poor and religious refugees who escaped out of France
in the cruel persecution.I went to Hampton Court to give his Majesty thanks for
his late gracious favor, though it was but granting what was due.While
I was in the Council Chamber, came in some persons, at the head of whom
was a formal man with a large roll of parchment in his hand, being an
ADDRESS (as he said, for he introduced it with a speech) of the people
of Coventry, giving his Majesty their great acknowledgments for his
granting a liberty of conscience; he added that this was not the
application of one party only, but the unanimous address of Church of
England men, Presbyterians, Independents, and Anabaptists, to show how
extensive his Majesty's grace was, as taking in all parties to his
indulgence and protection, which had removed all dissensions and
animosities, which would not only unite them in bonds of Christian
charity, but exceedingly encourage their future industry, to the
improvement of trade, and spreading his Majesty's glory throughout the
world; and that now he had given to God his empire, God would establish
his; with expressions of great loyalty and submission; and so he gave
the roll to the King, which being returned to him again, his Majesty
caused him to read.The address was short, but much to the substance of
the speech of their foreman, to whom the King, pulling off his hat, said
that what he had done in giving liberty of conscience, was, what was
ever his judgment ought to be done; and that, as he would preserve them
in their enjoyment of it during his reign, so he would endeavor to
settle it by law, that it should never be altered by his successors.After this, he gave them his hand to kiss.It was reported the
subscribers were above 1,000.But this is not so remarkable as an address of the week before (as I was
assured by one present), of some of the FAMILY OF LOVE, His Majesty
asked them what this worship consisted in, and how many their party
might consist of; they told him their custom was to read the Scripture,
and then to preach; but did not give any further account, only said that
for the rest they were a sort of refined Quakers, but their number very
small, not consisting, as they said, of above threescore in all, and
those chiefly belonging to the Isle of Ely.Blathwaite's (two miles from Hampton).This gentleman is Secretary of War, Clerk of the Council, etc., having
raised himself by his industry from very moderate circumstances.He is a
very proper, handsome person, very dexterous in business, and besides
all this, has married a great fortune.His income by the Army, Council,
and Secretary to the Committee of Foreign Plantations, brings him in
above L2,000 per annum.The Privy Seal for L6,000 was passed to me, so that this
tedious affair was dispatched.Hitherto, a very windy and tempestuous
summer.The French sermons to the refugees were continued at Greenwich

19th July, 1687.In the way, I dined at Ashted, with
my Lady Mordaunt.I went to see Albury, now purchased by Mr.Finch (the
King's Solicitor and son to the late Lord Chancellor); I found the
garden which I first designed for the Duke of Norfolk, nothing improved.I went to visit Lord Clarendon at Swallowfield, where
was my Lord Cornbury just arrived from Denmark, whither he had
accompanied the Prince of Denmark two months before, and now come back.The miserable tyranny under which that nation lives, he related to us;
the King keeps them under an army of 40,000 men, all Germans, he not
daring to trust his own subjects.Notwithstanding this, the Danes are
exceedingly proud, the country very poor and miserable.Returned home to Sayes Court from Wotton, having been
five weeks absent with my brother and friends, who entertained us very
nobly.God be praised for his goodness, and this refreshment after my
many troubles, and let his mercy and providence ever preserve me.The Lord Mayor sent me an Officer with a staff, to
be one of the Governors of St.PERSECUTION RAGING IN FRANCE; divers churches there fired by lightning,
priests struck, consecrated hosts, etc., burnt and destroyed, both at
St.Malos and Paris, at the grand procession on Corpus Christi day.I went to Lambeth, and dined with the Archbishop.After dinner, I retired into the library, which I found exceedingly
improved; there are also divers rare manuscripts in a room apart.I was godfather to Sir John Chardin's son, christened
at Greenwich Church, named John.The Earl of Bath and Countess of
Carlisle, the other sponsors.An Anabaptist, a very odd ignorant person, a
mechanic, I think, was Lord Mayor.The King and Queen, and Dadi, the
Pope's Nuncio, invited to a feast at Guildhall.A strange turn of
affairs, that those who scandalized the Church of England as favorers of
Popery, should publicly invite an emissary from Rome, one who
represented the very person of their Antichrist!My son was returned out of Devon, where he had been
on a commission from the Lords of the Treasury about a concealment of
land.I went with my Lord Chief-Justice Herbert, to see
his house at Walton-on-Thames: it is a barren place.To a very ordinary
house he had built a very handsome library, designing more building to
it than the place deserves, in my opinion.He desired my advice about
laying out his gardens, etc.The next day, we went to Weybridge, to see
some pictures of the Duchess of Norfolk's, particularly the statue, or
child in gremio, said to be of Michael Angelo; but there are reasons to
think it rather a copy, from some proportion in the figures ill taken.Slingsby, Master of the Mint, being under
very deplorable circumstances on account of his creditors, and
especially the King, I did my endeavor with the Lords of the Treasury to
be favorable to him.My Lord Arran, eldest son to the Duke of Hamilton, being now married to
Lady Ann Spencer, eldest daughter of the Earl of Sunderland, Lord
President of the Council, I and my family had most glorious favors sent
us, the wedding being celebrated with extraordinary splendor.There was a solemn and particular office used at
our, and all the churches of London and ten miles round, for a
thanksgiving to God, for her Majesty being with child.This afternoon I went not to church, being employed
on a religious treatise I had undertaken._Post annum 1588--1660--1688, Annus Mirabilis Tertius._[64]

    [Footnote 64: This seems to have been added after the page was
    written.]Being the Martyrdom day of King Charles I., our
curate made a florid oration against the murder of that excellent
Prince, with an exhortation to obedience from the example of David; 1
Samuel xxvi.[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th February, 1688.My daughter Evelyn going in the coach to visit in
the city, a jolt (the door being not fast shut) flung her quite out in
such manner, as the hind wheels passed over her a little above her
knees.Yet it pleased God, besides the bruises of the wheels, she had no
other harm.In two days she was able to walk, and soon after perfectly
well; through God Almighty's great mercy to an excellent wife and a most
dutiful and discreet daughter-in-law.I received the sad news of my niece Montague's
death at Woodcot on the 15th.I gave in my account about the sick and wounded, in
order to have my quietus.Parker, Bishop of Oxford, who so lately published
his extravagant treatise about transubstantiation, and for abrogating
the test and penal laws, died.He was esteemed a violent, passionate,
haughty man, but yet being pressed to declare for the Church of Rome, he
utterly refused it.The French TYRANT now finding he could make no proselytes among those
Protestants of quality, and others, whom he had caused to be shut up in
dungeons, and confined to nunneries and monasteries, gave them, after so
long trial, a general releasement, and leave to go out of the kingdom,
but utterly taking their estates and their children; so that great
numbers came daily into England and other places, where they were
received and relieved with very considerate Christian charity.This
Providence and goodness of God to those who thus constantly held out,
did so work upon those miserable poor souls who, to avoid the
persecution, signed their renunciation, and to save their estates went
to mass, that reflecting on what they had done, they grew so affected in
their conscience, that not being able to support it, they in great
numbers through all the French provinces, acquainted the magistrates and
lieutenants that being sorry for their apostacy, they were resolved to
return to their old religion; that they would go no more to mass, but
peaceably assemble when they could, to beg pardon and worship God, but
so without weapons as not to give the least umbrage of rebellion or
sedition, imploring their pity and commiseration; and, accordingly,
meeting so from time to time, the dragoon-missioners, Popish officers
and priests, fell upon them, murdered and put them to death, whoever
they could lay hold on; they without the least resistance embraced
death, torture, or hanging, with singing psalms and praying for their
persecutors to the last breath, yet still continuing the former
assembling of themselves in desolate places, suffering with incredible
constancy, that through God's mercy they might obtain pardon for this
lapse.Such examples of Christian behavior have not been seen since the
primitive persecutions; and doubtless God will do some signal work in
the end, if we can with patience and resignation hold out, and depend on
his Providence.I went with Sir Charles Littleton to Sheen, a house
and estate given him by Lord Brounker; one who was ever noted for a
hard, covetous, vicious man; but for his worldly craft and skill in
gaming few exceeded him.Coming to die, he bequeathed all his land,
house, furniture, etc., to Sir Charles, to whom he had no manner of
relation, but an ancient friendship contracted at the famous siege of
Colchester, forty years before.It is a pretty place, with fine gardens,
and well planted, and given to one worthy of them, Sir Charles being an
honest gentleman and soldier.He is brother to Sir Henry Littleton of
Worcestershire, whose great estate he is likely to inherit, his brother
being without children.They are descendants of the great lawyer of that
name, and give the same arms and motto.Temple, formerly maid of honor to the late Queen, a beautiful lady, and
he has many fine children, so that none envy his good fortune.After dinner, we went to see Sir William Temple's near to it; the
most remarkable things are his orangery and gardens, where the
wall-fruit-trees are most exquisitely nailed and trained, far better
than I ever noted.There are many good pictures, especially of Vandyke's, in both these
houses, and some few statues and small busts in the latter.From thence to Kew, to visit Sir Henry Capel's, whose orangery and
_myrtetum_ are most beautiful and perfectly well kept.He was contriving
very high palisadoes of reeds to shade his oranges during the summer,
and painting those reeds in oil.[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st April, 1688.In the morning, the first sermon was by Dr.Paul's (at Whitehall), on Luke x.The
Holy Communion followed, but was so interrupted by the rude breaking in
of multitudes zealous to hear the second sermon, to be preached by the
Bishop of Bath and Wells, that the latter part of that holy office could
hardly be heard, or the sacred elements be distributed without great
trouble.The Princess being come, he preached on Mich.8, 9, 10,
describing the calamity of the Reformed Church of Judah under the
Babylonian persecution, for her sins, and God's delivery of her on her
repentance; that as Judah emerged, so should the now Reformed Church,
whenever insulted and persecuted.He preached with his accustomed
action, zeal, and energy, so that people flocked from all quarters to
hear him.A dry, cold, backward spring; easterly winds.The persecution still raging in France, multitudes of Protestants, and
many very considerable and great persons flying hither, produced a
second general contribution, the <DW7>s, by God's Providence, as yet
making small progress among us.The weather was, till now, so cold and sharp, by an
almost perpetual east wind, which had continued many months, that there
was little appearance of any spring, and yet the winter was very
favorable as to frost and snow.To London, about my petition for allowances upon the
account of Commissioner for Sick and Wounded in the former war with
Holland.His Majesty, alarmed by the great fleet of the Dutch
(while we had a very inconsiderable one), went down to Chatham; their
fleet was well prepared, and out, before we were in any readiness, or
had any considerable number to have encountered them, had there been
occasion, to the great reproach of the nation; while being in profound
peace, there was a mighty land army, which there was no need of, and no
force at sea, where only was the apprehension; but the army was
doubtless kept and increased, in order to bring in and countenance
Popery, the King beginning to discover his intention, by many instances
pursued by the Jesuits, against his first resolution to alter nothing in
the Church Establishment, so that it appeared there can be no reliance
on Popish promises.The King enjoining the ministers to read his
Declaration for giving liberty of conscience (as it was styled) in all
churches of England, this evening, six Bishops, Bath and Wells,[65]
Peterborough,[66] Ely,[67] Chichester,[68] St.Asaph,[69] and
Bristol,[70] in the name of all the rest of the Bishops, came to his
Majesty to petition him, that he would not impose the reading of it to
the several congregations within their dioceses; not that they were
averse to the publishing it for want of due tenderness toward
dissenters, in relation to whom they should be willing to come to such a
temper as should be thought fit, when that matter might be considered
and settled in Parliament and Convocation; but that, the Declaration
being founded on such a dispensing power as might at pleasure set aside
all laws ecclesiastical and civil, it appeared to them illegal, as it
had done to the Parliament in 1661 and 1672, and that it was a point of
such consequence, that they could not so far make themselves parties to
it, as the reading of it in church in time of divine service amounted
to.[Footnote 70: Sir John Trelawny, Bart.]The King was so far incensed at this address, that he with threatening
expressions commanded them to obey him in reading it at their perils,
and so dismissed them.[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th May, 1688.I went to Whitehall Chapel, where, after the morning
lessons, the Declaration was read by one of the choir who used to read
the chapters.I hear it was in the Abbey Church, Westminster, but almost
universally forborne throughout all London: the consequences of which a
little time will show.All the discourse now was about the Bishops refusing to
read the injunction for the abolition of the Test, etc.It seems the
injunction came so crudely from the Secretary's office, that it was
neither sealed nor signed in form, nor had any lawyer been consulted, so
as the Bishops who took all imaginable advice, put the Court to great
difficulties how to proceed against them.Great were the consults, and a
proclamation was expected all this day; but nothing was done.The action
of the Bishops was universally applauded, and reconciled many adverse
parties, <DW7>s only excepted, who were now exceedingly perplexed, and
violent courses were every moment expected.Report was, that the
Protestant secular Lords and Nobility would abet the Clergy.The Queen Dowager, hitherto bent on her return into Portugal, now on the
sudden, on allegation of a great debt owing her by his Majesty disabling
her, declares her resolution to stay.News arrived of the most prodigious earthquake that was almost ever
heard of, subverting the city of Lima and country in Peru, with a
dreadful inundation following it.This day, the Archbishop of Canterbury, with the
Bishops of Ely, Chichester, St.Asaph, Bristol, Peterborough, and Bath
and Wells, were sent from the Privy Council prisoners to the Tower, for
refusing to give bail for their appearance, on their not reading the
Declaration for liberty of conscience; they refused to give bail, as it
would have prejudiced their peerage.The concern of the people for them
was wonderful, infinite crowds on their knees begging their blessing,
and praying for them, as they passed out of the barge along the Tower
wharf.A YOUNG PRINCE born, which will cause disputes.About two o'clock, we heard the Tower ordnance discharged, and the bells
ring for the birth of a Prince of Wales.This was very surprising, it
having been universally given out that her Majesty did not look till the
next month.I went to the Tower to see the Bishops, visited the
Archbishop and the Bishops of Ely, St.Being the first day of term, the Bishops were brought
to Westminster on habeas corpus, when the indictment was read, and they
were called on to plead; their counsel objected that the warrant was
illegal; but, after long debate, it was overruled, and they pleaded.The
Court then offered to take bail for their appearance; but this they
refused, and at last were dismissed on their own recognizances to appear
that day fortnight; the Archbishop in L200, the Bishops in L100 each.Was a day of thanksgiving in London and ten miles about
for the young Prince's birth; a form of prayer made for the purpose by
the Bishop of Rochester.They appeared; the trial lasted from nine in the
morning to past six in the evening, when the jury retired to consider of
their verdict, and the Court adjourned to nine the next morning.The
jury were locked up till that time, eleven of them being for an
acquittal; but one (Arnold, a brewer) would not consent.At length he
agreed with the others.The Chief Justice, Wright, behaved with great
moderation and civility to the Bishops.Alibone, a <DW7>, was strongly
against them; but Holloway and Powell being of opinion in their favor,
they were acquitted.When this was heard, there was great rejoicing; and
there was a lane of people from the King's Bench to the water side, on
their knees, as the Bishops passed and repassed, to beg their blessing.Bonfires were made that night, and bells rung, which was taken very ill
at Court, and an appearance of nearly sixty Earls and Lords, etc., on
the bench, did not a little comfort them; but indeed they were all along
full of comfort and cheerful.Note, they denied to pay the Lieutenant of the Tower (Hales, who used
them very surlily), any fees, alleging that none were due.The night was solemnized with bonfires, and other fireworks, etc.The two judges, Holloway and Powell, were displaced.Godolphin and his brother Sir William to
St.Alban's, to see a library he would have bought of the widow of Dr.Cartwright, late Archdeacon of St.Alban's, a very good collection of
books, especially in divinity; he was to give L300 for them.Having seen
the GREAT CHURCH, now newly repaired by a public contribution, we
returned home.One of the King's chaplains preached before the Princess
on Exodus xiv.13, "Stand still, and behold the salvation of the Lord,"
which he applied so boldly to the present conjuncture of the Church of
England, that more could scarce be said to encourage desponders.The
Popish priests were not able to carry their cause against their learned
adversaries, who confounded them both by their disputes and writings.The camp now began at Hounslow, but the nation was in
high discontent.Colonel Titus, Sir Henry Vane (son of him who was executed for his
treason), and some other of the Presbyterians and Independent party,
were sworn of the Privy Council, from hopes of thereby diverting that
party from going over to the Bishops and Church of England, which now
they began to do, foreseeing the design of the <DW7>s to descend and
take in their most hateful of heretics (as they at other times expressed
them to be) to effect their own ends, now evident; the utter extirpation
of the Church of England first, and then the rest would follow.This night the fireworks were played off, that had been
prepared for the Queen's upsitting.We saw them to great advantage; they
were very fine, and cost some thousands of pounds, in the pyramids,
statues, etc., but were spent too soon for so long a preparation.I went to Lambeth to visit the Archbishop, whom I
found very cheerful.Tenison now told me there would suddenly be some
great thing discovered.This was the Prince of Orange intending to come
over.I went to Althorpe, in Northamptonshire, seventy
miles.A coach and four horses took up me and my son at Whitehall, and
carried us to Dunstable, where we arrived and dined at noon, and from
thence another coach and six horses carried us to Althorpe, four miles
beyond Northampton, where we arrived by seven o'clock that evening.Both
these coaches were hired for me by that noble Countess of Sunderland,
who invited me to her house at Althorpe, where she entertained me and my
son with very extraordinary kindness; I stayed till the Thursday.Jeffryes, the minister of Althorpe, who was my
Lord's chaplain when ambassador in France, preached the shortest
discourse I ever heard; but what was defective in the amplitude of his
sermon, he had supplied in the largeness and convenience of the
parsonage house, which the doctor (who had at least L600 a year in
spiritual advancement) had newly built, and made fit for a person of
quality to live in, with gardens and all accommodation according
therewith.My lady carried us to see Lord Northampton's Seat, a very strong, large
house, built with stone, not altogether modern.They were enlarging the
garden, in which was nothing extraordinary, except the iron gate opening
into the park, which indeed was very good work, wrought in flowers
painted with blue and gilded.There is a noble walk of elms toward the
front of the house by the bowling green.I was not in any room of the
house besides a lobby looking into the garden, where my Lord and his new
Countess (Sir Stephen Fox's daughter, whom I had known from a child)
entertained the Countess and her daughter the Countess of Arran (newly
married to the son of the Duke of Hamilton), with so little good grace,
and so dully, that our visit was very short, and so we returned to
Althorpe, twelve miles distant.[Sidenote: ALTHORPE]

The house, or rather palace, at Althorpe, is a noble uniform pile in
form of a half H, built of brick and freestone, balustered and _a la
moderne_; the hall is well, the staircase excellent; the rooms of state,
galleries, offices and furniture, such as may become a great prince.It
is situated in the midst of a garden, exquisitely planted and kept, and
all this in a park walled in with hewn stone, planted with rows and
walks of trees, canals and fish ponds, and stored with game.And, what
is above all this, governed by a lady, who without any show of
solicitude, keeps everything in such admirable order, both within and
without, from the garret to the cellar, that I do not believe there is
any in this nation, or in any other, that exceeds her in such exact
order, without ostentation, but substantially great and noble.The
meanest servant is lodged so neat and cleanly; the service at the
several tables, the good order and decency--in a word, the entire
economy is perfectly becoming a wise and noble person.She is one who
for her distinguished esteem of me from a long and worthy friendship, I
must ever honor and celebrate.I wish from my soul the Lord, her husband
(whose parts and abilities are otherwise conspicuous), was as worthy of
her, as by a fatal apostasy and court-ambition he has made himself
unworthy!This is what she deplores, and it renders her as much
affliction as a lady of great soul and much prudence is capable of.The
Countess of Bristol, her mother, a grave and honorable lady, has the
comfort of seeing her daughter and grandchildren under the same economy,
especially Mr.Charles Spencer, a youth of extraordinary hopes, very
learned for his age, and ingenious, and under a governor of great worth.Happy were it, could as much be said of the elder brother, the Lord
Spencer, who, rambling about the world, dishonors both his name and his
family, adding sorrow to sorrow to a mother, who has taken all
imaginable care of his education.There is a daughter very young married
to the Earl of Clancarty, who has a great and fair estate in Ireland,
but who yet gives no great presage of worth,--so universally
contaminated is the youth of this corrupt and abandoned age!But this is
again recompensed by my Lord Arran, a sober and worthy gentleman, who
has espoused the Lady Ann Spencer, a young lady of admirable
accomplishments and virtue.I left this noble place and conversation, my lady
having provided carriages to convey us back in the same manner as we
went, and a dinner being prepared at Dunstable against our arrival.Northampton, having been lately burned and re-edified, is now become a
town that for the beauty of the buildings, especially the church and
townhouse, may compare with the neatest in Italy itself.Sprat, Bishop of Rochester, wrote a very honest and handsome letter
to the Commissioners Ecclesiastical, excusing himself from sitting any
longer among them, he by no means approving of their prosecuting the
Clergy who refused to read the Declaration for liberty of conscience, in
prejudice of the Church of England.The Dutch make extraordinary preparations both at sea and land, which
with no small progress Popery makes among us, puts us to many
difficulties.The Popish Irish soldiers commit many murders and insults;
the whole nation disaffected, and in apprehensions.After long trials of the doctors to bring up the little Prince of Wales
by hand (so many of her Majesty's children having died infants) not
succeeding, a country nurse, the wife of a tile maker, is taken to give
it suck.I went to London, where I found the Court in the
utmost consternation on report of the Prince of Orange's landing; which
put Whitehall into so panic a fear, that I could hardly believe it
possible to find such a change.Writs were issued in order to a Parliament, and a declaration to back
the good order of elections, with great professions of maintaining the
Church of England, but without giving any sort of satisfaction to the
people, who showed their high discontent at several things in the
Government.Earthquakes had utterly demolished the ancient Smyrna, and several other
places in Greece, Italy, and even in the Spanish Indies, forerunners of
greater calamities.God Almighty preserve his Church and all who put
themselves under the shadow of his wings, till these things be
overpassed.The Court in so extraordinary a consternation, on
assurance of the Prince of Orange's intention to land, that the writs
sent forth for a Parliament were recalled.[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th October, 1688.16, showing the Scriptures to be our only rule of faith, and its
perfection above all traditions.After which, near 1,000 devout persons
partook of the Communion.The sermon was chiefly occasioned by a Jesuit,
who in the Masshouse on the Sunday before had disparaged the Scripture
and railed at our translation, which some present contradicting, they
pulled him out of the pulpit, and treated him very coarsely, insomuch
that it was like to create a great disturbance in the city.Hourly expectation of the Prince of Orange's invasion heightened to that
degree, that his Majesty thought fit to abrogate the Commission for the
dispensing Power (but retaining his own right still to dispense with all
laws) and restore the ejected Fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford.In
the meantime, he called over 5,000 Irish, and 4,000 Scots, and continued
to remove Protestants and put in <DW7>s at Portsmouth and other places
of trust, and retained the Jesuits about him, increasing the universal
discontent.It brought people to so desperate a pass, that they seemed
passionately to long for and desire the landing of that Prince, whom
they looked on to be their deliverer from Popish tyranny, praying
incessantly for an east wind, which was said to be the only hindrance of
his expedition with a numerous army ready to make a descent.To such a
strange temper, and unheard of in former times, was this poor nation
reduced, and of which I was an eyewitness.The apprehension was (and
with reason) that his Majesty's forces would neither at land nor sea
oppose them with that vigor requisite to repel invaders.The late imprisoned Bishops were now called to reconcile matters, and
the Jesuits hard at work to foment confusion among the Protestants by
their usual tricks.A letter was sent to the Archbishop of
Canterbury,[71] informing him, from good hands, of what was contriving
by them.A paper of what the Bishops advised his Majesty was published.The Bishops were enjoined to prepare a form of prayer against the feared
invasion.The letter was as follows:--

    "My Lord, The honor and reputation which your Grace's piety,
    prudence, and signal courage, have justly merited and obtained, not
    only from the sons of the Church of England, but even universally
    from those Protestants among us who are Dissenters from her
    discipline; God Almighty's Providence and blessing upon your Grace's
    vigilancy and extraordinary endeavors will not suffer to be
    diminished in this conjuncture.The conversation I now and then have
    with some in place who have the opportunity of knowing what is doing
    in the most secret recesses and cabals of our Church's adversaries,
    obliges me to acquaint you, that the calling of your Grace and the
    rest of the Lords Bishops to Court, and what has there of late been
    required of you, is only to create a jealousy and suspicion among
    well-meaning people of such compliances, as it is certain they have
    no cause to apprehend.The plan of this and of all that which is to
    follow of seeming favor thence, is wholly drawn by the Jesuits, who
    are at this time more than ever busy to make divisions among us, all
    other arts and mechanisms having hitherto failed them.They have,
    with other things contrived that your Lordships the Bishops should
    give his Majesty advice separately, without calling any of the rest
    of the Peers, which, though maliciously suggested, spreads generally
    about the town.I do not at all question but your Grace will
    speedily prevent the operation of this venom, and that you will
    think it highly necessary so to do, that your Grace is also enjoined
    to compose a form of prayer, wherein the Prince of Orange is
    expressly to be named the Invader: of this I presume not to say
    anything; but for as much as in all the Declarations, etc., which
    have hitherto been published in pretended favor of the Church of
    England, there is not once the least mention of the REFORMED or
    PROTESTANT RELIGION, but only of the CHURCH OF ENGLAND AS BY LAW
    ESTABLISHED, which Church the <DW7>s tell us is the CHURCH OF ROME,
    which is (say they) the Catholic Church of England--that only is
    established by Law; the Church of England in the REFORMED sense so
    established, is but by an usurped authority.The antiquity of THAT
    would by these words be explained, and utterly defeat this false and
    subdolous construction, and take off all exceptions whatsoever; if,
    in all extraordinary offices, upon these occasions, the words
    REFORMED and PROTESTANT were added to that of the CHURCH OF ENGLAND
    BY LAW ESTABLISHED.And whosoever threatens to invade or come
    against us, to the prejudice of that Church, in God's name, be they
    Dutch or Irish, let us heartily pray and fight against them.My
    Lord, this is, I confess, a bold, but honest period; and, though I
    am well assured that your Grace is perfectly acquainted with all
    this before, and therefore may blame my impertinence, as that does
    [Greek: allotrioepiskopein]; yet I am confident you will not reprove
    the zeal of one who most humbly begs your Grace's pardon, with your
    blessing.(From a copy in Evelyn's
    handwriting.)This day signal for the victory
of William the Conqueror against Harold, near Battel, in Sussex.The
wind, which had been hitherto west, was east all this day.Wonderful
expectation of the Dutch fleet.Public prayers ordered to be read in the
churches against invasion.A tumult in London on the rabble demolishing a
Popish chapel that had been set up in the city.Lady Sunderland acquainted me with his Majesty's
taking away the Seals from Lord Sunderland, and of her being with the
Queen to intercede for him.It is conceived that he had of late grown
remiss in pursuing the interest of the Jesuitical counsels; some
reported one thing, some another; but there was doubtless some secret
betrayed, which time may discover.There was a Council called, to which were summoned the Archbishop of
Canterbury, the Judges, the Lord Mayor, etc.The Queen Dowager, and all
the ladies and lords who were present at the Queen Consort's labor, were
to give their testimony upon oath of the Prince of Wales's birth,
recorded both at the Council Board and at the Chancery a day or two
after.This procedure was censured by some as below his Majesty to
condescend to, on the talk of the people.It was remarkable that on this
occasion the Archbishop, Marquis of Halifax, the Earls of Clarendon and
Nottingham, refused to sit at the Council table among <DW7>s, and their
bold telling his Majesty that whatever was done while such sat among
them was unlawful and incurred _praemunire_;--at least, if what I heard
be true.I dined with Lord Preston, made Secretary of State,
in the place of the Earl of Sunderland.Boyle, when came in the Duke of Hamilton and Earl of
Burlington.The Duke told us many particulars of Mary Queen of Scots,
and her amours with the Italian favorite, etc.My birthday, being the 68th year of my age.O
blessed Lord, grant that as I grow in years, so may I improve in grace!Be thou my protector this following year, and preserve me and mine from
those dangers and great confusions that threaten a sad revolution to
this sinful nation!Defend thy church, our holy religion, and just laws,
disposing his Majesty to listen to sober and healing counsels, that if
it be thy blessed will, we may still enjoy that happy tranquility which
hitherto thou hast continued to us!Dined with Lord Preston, with other company, at Sir
Stephen Fox's.Continual alarms of the Prince of Orange, but no
certainty.Reports of his great losses of horse in the storm, but
without any assurance.A man was taken with divers papers and printed
manifestoes, and carried to Newgate, after examination at the Cabinet
Council.There was likewise a declaration of the States for satisfaction
of all public ministers at The Hague, except to the English and the
French.There was in that of the Prince's an expression, as if the Lords
both spiritual and temporal had invited him over, with a deduction of
the causes of his enterprise.This made his Majesty convene my Lord of
Canterbury and the other Bishops now in town, to give an account of what
was in the manifesto, and to enjoin them to clear themselves by some
public writing of this disloyal charge.It was now certainly reported by some who saw the
fleet, and the Prince embark, that they sailed from the Brill on
Wednesday morning, and that the Princess of Orange was there to take
leave of her husband.Fresh reports of the Prince being landed somewhere
about Portsmouth, or the Isle of Wight, whereas it was thought it would
have been northward.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1688.I went to London; heard the news of the Prince
having landed at Torbay, coming with a fleet of near 700 sail, passing
through the Channel with so favorable a wind, that our navy could not
intercept, or molest them.This put the King and Court into great
consternation, they were now employed in forming an army to stop their
further progress, for they were got into Exeter, and the season and ways
very improper for his Majesty's forces to march so great a distance.The Archbishop of Canterbury and some few of the other Bishops and
Lords in London, were sent for to Whitehall, and required to set forth
their abhorrence of this invasion.They assured his Majesty that they
had never invited any of the Prince's party, or were in the least privy
to it, and would be ready to show all testimony of their loyalty; but,
as to a public declaration, being so few, they desired that his Majesty
would call the rest of their brethren and Peers, that they might consult
what was fit to be done on this occasion, not thinking it right to
publish anything without them, and till they had themselves seen the
Prince's manifesto, in which it was pretended he was invited in by the
Lords, spiritual and temporal.This did not please the King; so they
departed.A declaration was published, prohibiting all persons to see or read the
Prince's manifesto, in which was set forth at large the cause of his
expedition, as there had been one before from the States.These are the beginnings of sorrow, unless God in his mercy prevent it
by some happy reconciliation of all dissensions among us.This, in all
likelihood, nothing can effect except a free Parliament; but this we
cannot hope to see, while there are any forces on either side.I pray
God to protect and direct the King for the best and truest interest of
his people!--I saw his Majesty touch for the evil, Piten the Jesuit, and
Warner officiating.Lord Cornbury carries some regiments, and marches to
Honiton, the Prince's headquarters.The city of London in disorder; the
rabble pulled down the nunnery newly bought by the <DW7>s of Lord
Berkeley, at St.The Queen prepares to go to Portsmouth for
safety, to attend the issue of this commotion, which has a dreadful
aspect.The King goes to
Salisbury to rendezvous the army, and return to London.Lord Delamere
appears for the Prince in Cheshire.The
Archbishop of Canterbury and some Bishops, and such Peers as were in
London, address his Majesty to call a Parliament.The King invites all
foreign nations to come over.The French take all the Palatinate, and
alarm the Germans more than ever.We adjourned the
election of a President to 23d of April, by reason of the public
commotions, yet dined together as of custom this day.Afterward, visited my Lord Godolphin, then going with the Marquis of
Halifax and Earl of Nottingham as Commissioners to the Prince of Orange;
he told me they had little power.Bath, York, Hull, Bristol, and all the eminent nobility and persons of
quality through England, declare for the Protestant religion and laws,
and go to meet the Prince, who every day sets forth new Declarations
against the <DW7>s.The great favorites at Court, Priests and Jesuits,
fly or abscond.Everything, till now concealed, flies abroad in public
print, and is cried about the streets.Expectation of the Prince coming
to Oxford.The Prince of Wales and great treasure sent privily to
Portsmouth, the Earl of Dover being Governor.Address from the Fleet not
grateful to his Majesty.The <DW7>s in offices lay down their
commissions, and fly.Universal consternation among them; it looks like
a revolution.The rabble
demolished all Popish chapels, and several <DW7> lords and gentlemen's
houses, especially that of the Spanish Ambassador, which they pillaged,
and burned his library.The King flies to sea, puts in at Faversham for
ballast; is rudely treated by the people; comes back to Whitehall.The Prince of Orange is advanced to Windsor, is invited by the King to
St.James's, the messenger sent was the Earl of Faversham, the General
of the Forces, who going without trumpet, or passport, is detained
prisoner by the Prince, who accepts the invitation, but requires his
Majesty to retire to some distant place, that his own guards may be
quartered about the palace and city.This is taken heinously and the
King goes privately to Rochester; is persuaded to come back; comes on
the Sunday; goes to mass, and dines in public, a Jesuit saying grace (I
was present).That night was a Council; his Majesty refuses to
assent to all the proposals; goes away again to Rochester.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th December, 1688.I saw the King take barge to Gravesend at twelve
o'clock--a sad sight!James's, and fills
Whitehall with Dutch guards.A Council of Peers meet about an expedient
to call a Parliament; adjourn to the House of Lords.The Chancellor,
Earl of Peterborough, and divers others taken.The Earl of Sunderland
flies; Sir Edward Hale, Walker, and others, taken and secured.All the world go to see the Prince at St.James's, where there is a
great Court.There I saw him, and several of my acquaintance who came
over with him.He is very stately, serious and reserved.The English
soldiers sent out of town to disband them; not well pleased.The King passes into France, whither the Queen and
child were gone a few days before.The Peers and such Commoners as were members of the
Parliament at Oxford, being the last of Charles II.meeting, desire the
Prince of Orange to take on him the disposal of the public revenue till
a convention of Lords and Commons should meet in full body, appointed by
his circular letters to the shires and boroughs, 22d of January.I had
now quartered upon me a Lieutenant-Colonel and eight horses.This day prayers for the Prince of Wales were first
left off in our Church.A long frost and deep snow; the Thames almost
frozen over.I visited the Archbishop of Canterbury, where I
found the Bishops of St.Asaph, Ely, Bath and Wells, Peterborough, and
Chichester, the Earls of Aylesbury and Clarendon, Sir George Mackenzie,
Lord-Advocate of Scotland, and then came in a Scotch Archbishop, etc.After prayers and dinner, divers serious matters were discoursed,
concerning the present state of the Public, and sorry I was to find
there was as yet no accord in the judgments of those of the Lords and
Commons who were to convene; some would have the Princess made Queen
without any more dispute, others were for a Regency; there was a Tory
party (then so called), who were for inviting his Majesty again upon
conditions; and there were Republicans who would make the Prince of
Orange like a Stadtholder.The Romanists were busy among these several
parties to bring them into confusion: most for ambition or other
interest, few for conscience and moderate resolutions.I found nothing
of all this in this assembly of Bishops, who were pleased to admit me
into their discourses; they were all for a Regency, thereby to salve
their oaths, and so all public matters to proceed in his Majesty's name,
by that to facilitate the calling of Parliament, according to the laws
in being.My Lord of Canterbury gave me great thanks for the advertisement I sent
him in October, and assured me they took my counsel in that particular,
and that it came very seasonably.I found by the Lord-Advocate that the Bishops of Scotland (who were
indeed little worthy of that character, and had done much mischief in
that Church) were now coming about to the true interest, in this
conjuncture which threatened to abolish the whole hierarchy in that
kingdom; and therefore the Scottish Archbishop and Lord-Advocate
requested the Archbishop of Canterbury to use his best endeavors with
the Prince to maintain the Church there in the same state, as by law at
present settled.It now growing late, after some private discourse with his Grace, I took
my leave, most of the Lords being gone.The great convention being assembled the day before, falling upon the
question about the government, resolved that King James having by the
advice of the Jesuits and other wicked persons endeavored to subvert the
laws of the Church and State, and deserted the kingdom, carrying away
the seals, etc., without any care for the management of the government,
had by demise abdicated himself and wholly vacated his right; they did
therefore desire the Lords' concurrence to their vote, to place the
crown on the next heir, the Prince of Orange, for his life, then to the
Princess, his wife, and if she died without issue, to the Princess of
Denmark, and she failing, to the heirs of the Prince, excluding forever
all possibility of admitting a Roman Catholic.[Sidenote: LONDON]

27th January, 1689.I dined at the Admiralty, where was brought in a
child not twelve years old, the son of one Dr.Clench, of the most
prodigious maturity of knowledge, for I cannot call it altogether
memory, but something more extraordinary.Pepys and myself examined
him, not in any method, but with promiscuous questions, which required
judgment and discernment to answer so readily and pertinently.There was
not anything in chronology, history, geography, the several systems of
astronomy, courses of the stars, longitude, latitude, doctrine of the
spheres, courses and sources of rivers, creeks, harbors, eminent cities,
boundaries and bearings of countries, not only in Europe, but in any
other part of the earth, which he did not readily resolve and
demonstrate his knowledge of, readily drawing out with a pen anything he
would describe.He was able not only to repeat the most famous things
which are left us in any of the Greek or Roman histories, monarchies,
republics, wars, colonies, exploits by sea and land, but all the sacred
stories of the Old and New Testament; the succession of all the
monarchies, Babylonian, Persian, Greek, Roman, with all the lower
Emperors, Popes, Heresiarchs, and Councils, what they were called about,
what they determined, or in the controversy about Easter, the tenets of
the Gnostics, Sabellians, Arians, Nestorians; the difference between St.Cyprian and Stephen about re-baptism, the schisms.We leaped from that
to other things totally different, to Olympic years, and synchronisms;
we asked him questions which could not be resolved without considerable
meditation and judgment, nay of some particulars of the Civil Laws, of
the Digest and Code.He gave a stupendous account of both natural and
moral philosophy, and even in metaphysics.Having thus exhausted ourselves rather than this wonderful child, or
angel rather, for he was as beautiful and lovely in countenance as in
knowledge, we concluded with asking him if, in all he had read or heard
of, he had ever met with anything which was like this expedition of the
Prince of Orange, with so small a force to obtain three great kingdoms
without any contest.After a little thought, he told us that he knew of
nothing which did more resemble it than the coming of Constantine the
Great out of Britain, through France and Italy, so tedious a march, to
meet Maxentius, whom he overthrew at Pons Milvius with very little
conflict, and at the very gates of Rome, which he entered and was
received with triumph, and obtained the empire, not of three kingdoms
only, but of all the then known world.He was perfect in the Latin
authors, spoke French naturally, and gave us a description of France,
Italy, Savoy, Spain, ancient and modernly divided; as also of ancient
Greece, Scythia, and northern countries and tracts: we left questioning
further.He did this without any set or formal repetitions, as one who
had learned things without book, but as if he minded other things, going
about the room, and toying with a parrot there, and as he was at dinner
(_tanquam aliua agens_, as it were) seeming to be full of play, of a
lively, sprightly temper, always smiling, and exceedingly pleasant,
without the least levity, rudeness, or childishness.His father assured us he never imposed anything to charge his memory by
causing him to get things by heart, not even the rules of grammar; but
his tutor (who was a Frenchman) read to him, first in French, then in
Latin; that he usually played among other boys four or five hours every
day, and that he was as earnest at his play as at his study.He was
perfect in arithmetic, and now newly entered into Greek.In sum
(_horresco referens_), I had read of divers forward and precocious
youths, and some I have known, but I never did either hear or read of
anything like to this sweet child, if it be right to call him child who
has more knowledge than most men in the world.I counseled his father
not to set his heart too much on this jewel,

    "_Immodicis brevis est aetas, et rara senectus,_"

as I myself learned by sad experience in my most dear child Richard,
many years since, who, dying before he was six years old, was both in
shape and countenance and pregnancy of learning, next to a prodigy.The votes of the House of Commons being carried up
by Mr.Hampden, their chairman, to the Lords, I got a station by the
Prince's lodgings at the door of the lobby to the House, and heard much
of the debate, which lasted very long.Lord Derby was in the chair (for
the House was resolved into a grand committee of the whole House); after
all had spoken, it came to the question, which was carried by three
voices against a Regency, which 51 were for, 54 against; the minority
alleging the danger of dethroning Kings, and scrupling many passages and
expressions in the vote of the Commons, too long to set down
particularly.Some were for sending to his Majesty with conditions:
others that the King could do no wrong, and that the maladministration
was chargeable on his ministers.There were not more than eight or nine
bishops, and but two against the Regency; the archbishop was absent, and
the clergy now began to change their note, both in pulpit and discourse,
on their old passive obedience, so as people began to talk of the
bishops being cast out of the House.In short, things tended to
dissatisfaction on both sides; add to this, the morose temper of the
Prince of Orange, who showed little countenance to the noblemen and
others, who expected a more gracious and cheerful reception when they
made their court.The English army also was not so in order, and firm to
his interest, nor so weakened but that it might give interruption.Ireland was in an ill posture as well as Scotland.Nothing was yet done
toward a settlement.God of his infinite mercy compose these things,
that we may be at last a Nation and a Church under some fixed and sober
establishment!'s MARTYRDOM; but
in all the public offices and pulpit prayers, the collects, and litany
for the King and Queen were curtailed and mutilated.Sharp preached
before the Commons, but was disliked, and not thanked for his sermon.At our church (the next day being appointed a
thanksgiving for deliverance by the Prince of Orange, with prayers
purposely composed), our lecturer preached in the afternoon a very
honest sermon, showing our duty to God for the many signal deliverances
of our Church, without touching on politics.The King's coronation day was ordered not to be
observed, as hitherto it had been.The Convention of the Lords and Commons now declare the Prince and
Princess of Orange King and Queen of England, France, and Ireland
(Scotland being an independent kingdom), the Prince and Princess being
to enjoy it jointly during their lives; but the executive authority to
be vested in the Prince during life, though all proceedings to run in
both names, and that it should descend to their issue, and for want of
such, to the Princess Anne of Denmark and her issue, and in want of
such, to the heirs of the body of the Prince, if he survive, and that
failing, to devolve to the Parliament, as they should think fit.These
produced a conference with the Lords, when also there was presented
heads of such new laws as were to be enacted.It is thought on these
conditions they will be proclaimed.There was much contest about the King's abdication, and whether he had
vacated the government.The Earl of Nottingham and about twenty Lords,
and many Bishops, entered their protests, but the concurrence was great
against them.Forces sending to Ireland, that kingdom
being in great danger by the Earl of Tyrconnel's army, and expectations
from France coming to assist them, but that King was busy in invading
Flanders, and encountering the German Princes.It is likely that this
will be the most remarkable summer for action, which has happened in
many years.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st February, 1689.James's on the
obligation to walk worthy of God's particular and signal deliverance of
the nation and church.I saw the NEW QUEEN and KING proclaimed the very next day after her
coming to Whitehall, Wednesday, 13th February, with great acclamation
and general good reception.It was believed
that both, especially the Princess, would have shown some (seeming)
reluctance at least, of assuming her father's crown, and made some
apology, testifying by her regret that he should by his mismanagement
necessitate the nation to so extraordinary a proceeding, which would
have shown very handsomely to the world, and according to the character
given of her piety; consonant also to her husband's first declaration,
that there was no intention of deposing the King, but of succoring the
nation; but nothing of all this appeared; she came into Whitehall
laughing and jolly, as to a wedding, so as to seem quite transported.She rose early the next morning, and in her undress, as it was reported,
before her women were up, went about from room to room to see the
convenience of Whitehall; lay in the same bed and apartment where the
late Queen lay, and within a night or two sat down to play at basset, as
the Queen, her predecessor used to do.She smiled upon and talked to
everybody, so that no change seemed to have taken place at Court since
her last going away, save that infinite crowds of people thronged to see
her, and that she went to our prayers.She seems to be of a good nature, and that she takes nothing to
heart: while the Prince, her husband, has a thoughtful countenance, is
wonderfully serious and silent, and seems to treat all persons alike
gravely, and to be very intent on affairs: Holland, Ireland, and France
calling for his care.Divers Bishops and Noblemen are not at all satisfied with this so sudden
assumption of the Crown, without any previous sending, and offering some
conditions to the absent King; or on his not returning, or not assenting
to those conditions, to have proclaimed him Regent; but the major part
of both Houses prevailed to make them King and Queen immediately, and a
crown was tempting.This was opposed and spoken against with such
vehemence by Lord Clarendon (her own uncle), that it put him by all
preferment, which must doubtless have been as great as could have been
given him.My Lord of Rochester, his brother, overshot himself, by the
same carriage and stiffness, which their friends thought they might have
well spared when they saw how it was like to be overruled, and that it
had been sufficient to have declared their dissent with less passion,
acquiescing in due time.The Archbishop of Canterbury and some of the rest, on scruple of
conscience and to salve the oaths they had taken, entered their protests
and hung off, especially the Archbishop, who had not all this while so
much as appeared out of Lambeth.This occasioned the wonder of many who
observed with what zeal they contributed to the Prince's expedition, and
all the while also rejecting any proposals of sending again to the
absent King; that they should now raise scruples, and such as created
much division among the people, greatly rejoicing the old courtiers, and
especially the <DW7>s.Another objection was, the invalidity of what was done by a convention
only, and the as yet unabrogated laws; this drew them to make themselves
on the 22d [February] a Parliament, the new King passing the act with
the crown on his head.The lawyers disputed, but necessity prevailed,
the government requiring a speedy settlement.Innumerable were the crowds, who solicited for, and expected offices;
most of the old ones were turned out.Two or three white staves were
disposed of some days before, as Lord Steward, to the Earl of
Devonshire; Treasurer of the household, to Lord Newport; Lord
Chamberlain to the King, to my Lord of Dorset; but there were as yet
none in offices of the civil government save the Marquis of Halifax as
Privy Seal.A council of thirty was chosen, Lord Derby president, but
neither Chancellor nor Judges were yet declared, the new Great Seal not
yet finished.Tillotson, Dean of Canterbury, made an excellent
discourse on Matt.44, exhorting to charity and forgiveness of
enemies; I suppose purposely, the new Parliament being furious about
impeaching those who were obnoxious, and as their custom has ever been,
going on violently, without reserve, or modification, while wise men
were of opinion the most notorious offenders being named and excepted,
an Act of Amnesty would be more seasonable, to pacify the minds of men
in so general a discontent of the nation, especially of those who did
not expect to see the government assumed without any regard to the
absent King, or proving a spontaneous abdication, or that the birth of
the Prince of Wales was an imposture; five of the Bishops also still
refusing to take the new oath.In the meantime, to gratify the people, the hearth-tax was remitted
forever; but what was intended to supply it, besides present great taxes
on land, is not named.The King abroad was now furnished by the French King with money and
officers for an expedition to Ireland.The great neglect in not more
timely preventing that from hence, and the disturbances in Scotland,
give apprehensions of great difficulties, before any settlement can be
perfected here, while the Parliament dispose of the great offices among
themselves.The Great Seal, Treasury and Admiralty put into commission
of many unexpected persons, to gratify the more; so that by the present
appearance of things (unless God Almighty graciously interpose and give
success in Ireland and settle Scotland) more trouble seems to threaten
the nation than could be expected.In the interim, the new King refers
all to the Parliament in the most popular manner, but is very slow in
providing against all these menaces, besides finding difficulties in
raising men to send abroad; the former army, which had never seen any
service hitherto, receiving their pay and passing their summer in an
idle scene of a camp at Hounslow, unwilling to engage, and many
disaffected, and scarce to be trusted.[Sidenote: LONDON]

29th March, 1689.The new King much blamed for neglecting Ireland, now
likely to be ruined by the Lord Tyrconnel and his Popish party, too
strong for the Protestants.Wonderful uncertainty where King James was,
whether in France or Ireland.The Scots seem as yet to favor King
William, rejecting King James's letter to them, yet declaring nothing
positively.Parliament preparing the
coronation oath.Presbyterians and Dissenters displeased at the vote for
preserving the Protestant religion as established by law, without
mentioning what they were to have as to indulgence.The Archbishop of Canterbury and four other Bishops refusing to come to
Parliament, it was deliberated whether they should incur _Praemunire_;
but it was thought fit to let this fall, and be connived at, for fear of
the people, to whom these Prelates were very dear, for the opposition
they had given to Popery.Things far from settled as was expected, by reason of
the slothful, sickly temper of the new King, and the Parliament's
unmindfulness of Ireland, which is likely to prove a sad omission.The Confederates beat the French out of the Palatinate, which they had
most barbarously ruined.I saw the procession to and from the Abbey Church of
Westminster, with the great feast in Westminster Hall, at the coronation
of King William and Queen Mary.What was different from former
coronations, was some alteration in the coronation oath.Burnet, now
made Bishop of Sarum, preached with great applause.The Parliament men
had scaffolds and places which took up the one whole side of the Hall.When the King and Queen had dined, the ceremony of the Champion, and
other services by tenure were performed.The Parliament men were feasted
in the Exchequer chamber, and had each of them a gold medal given them,
worth five-and-forty shillings.On the one side were the effigies of the
King and Queen inclining one to the other; on the reverse was Jupiter
throwing a bolt at Phaeton the words, "_Ne totus absumatur_": which was
but dull, seeing they might have had out of the poet something as
apposite.Much of the splendor of the proceeding was abated by the absence of
divers who should have contributed to it, there being but five Bishops,
four Judges (no more being yet sworn), and several noblemen and great
ladies wanting; the feast, however, was magnificent.The next day the
House of Commons went and kissed their new Majesties' hands in the
Banqueting House.Asaph to visit my Lord
of Canterbury at Lambeth, who had excused himself from officiating at
the coronation, which was performed by the Bishop of London, assisted by
the Archbishop of York.We had much private and free discourse with his
Grace concerning several things relating to the Church, there being now
a bill of comprehension to be brought from the Lords to the Commons.I
urged that when they went about to reform some particulars in the
Liturgy, Church discipline, Canons, etc., the baptizing in private
houses without necessity might be reformed, as likewise so frequent
burials in churches; the one proceeding much from the pride of women,
bringing that into custom which was only indulged in case of imminent
danger, and out of necessity during the rebellion, and persecution of
the clergy in our late civil wars; the other from the avarice of
ministers, who, in some opulent parishes, made almost as much of
permission to bury in the chancel and the church, as of their livings,
and were paid with considerable advantage and gifts for baptizing in
chambers.To this they heartily assented, and promised their endeavor to
get it reformed, utterly disliking both practices as novel and indecent.We discoursed likewise of the great disturbance and prejudice it might
cause, should the new oath, now on the anvil, be imposed on any, save
such as were in new office, without any retrospect to such as either had
no office, or had been long in office, who it was likely would have some
scruples about taking a new oath, having already sworn fidelity to the
government as established by law.This we all knew to be the case of my
Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, and some other persons who were not so
fully satisfied with the Convention making it an abdication of King
James, to whom they had sworn allegiance.King James was now certainly in Ireland with the Marshal d'Estrades,
whom he made a Privy Councillor; and who caused the King to remove the
Protestant Councillors, some whereof, it seems, had continued to sit,
telling him that the King of France, his master, would never assist him
if he did not immediately do it; by which it is apparent how the poor
Prince is managed by the French.Scotland declares for King William and Queen Mary, with the reasons of
their setting aside King James, not as abdicating, but forfeiting his
right by maladministration; they proceeded with much more caution and
prudence than we did, who precipitated all things to the great reproach
of the nation, all which had been managed by some crafty, ill-principled
men.The new Privy Council have a Republican spirit, manifestly
undermining all future succession of the Crown and prosperity of the
Church of England, which yet I hope they will not be able to accomplish
so soon as they expect, though they get into all places of trust and
profit.This was one of the most seasonable springs, free from
the usual sharp east winds that I have observed since the year 1660 (the
year of the Restoration), which was much such an one.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th April, 1689.I heard the lawyers plead before the Lords the writ
of error in the judgment of Oates, as to the charge against him of
perjury, which after debate they referred to the answer of Holloway,
etc., who were his judges.Asaph to
the Archbishop at Lambeth, where they entered into discourse concerning
the final destruction of Antichrist, both concluding that the third
trumpet and vial were now pouring out.Asaph considered the
killing of the two witnesses, to be the utter destruction of the
Cevennes Protestants by the French and Duke of Savoy, and the other the
Waldenses and Pyrenean Christians, who by all appearance from good
history had kept the primitive faith from the very Apostles' time till
now.The doubt his Grace suggested was, whether it could be made evident
that the present persecution had made so great a havoc of those faithful
people as of the other, and whether there were not yet some among them
in being who met together, it being stated from the text, Apoc.xi.,
that they should both be slain together.Mede's way of interpretation, and that he only failed in resolving too
hastily on the King of Sweden's (Gustavus Adolphus) success in Germany.They agreed that it would be good to employ some intelligent French
minister to travel as far as the Pyrenees to understand the present
state of the Church there, it being a country where hardly anyone
travels.There now came certain news that King James had not only landed in
Ireland, but that he had surprised Londonderry, and was become master of
that kingdom, to the great shame of our government, who had been so
often solicited to provide against it by timely succor, and which they
might so easily have done.This is a terrible beginning of more
troubles, especially should an army come thence into Scotland, people
being generally disaffected here and everywhere else, so that the seamen
and landmen would scarce serve without compulsion.A new oath was now fabricating for all the clergy to take, of obedience
to the present Government, in abrogation of the former oaths of
allegiance, which it is foreseen many of the bishops and others of the
clergy will not take.The penalty is to be the loss of their dignity and
spiritual preferment.This is thought to have been driven on by the
Presbyterians, our new governors.God in mercy send us help, and direct
the counsels to his glory and good of his Church!Public matters went very ill in Ireland: confusion and dissensions among
ourselves, stupidity, inconstancy, emulation, the governors employing
unskillful men in greatest offices, no person of public spirit and
ability appearing,--threaten us with a very sad prospect of what may be
the conclusion, without God's infinite mercy.A fight by Admiral Herbert with the French, he imprudently setting on
them in a creek as they were landing men in Ireland, by which we came
off with great slaughter and little honor--so strangely negligent and
remiss were we in preparing a timely and sufficient fleet.The Scots
Commissioners offer the crown to the NEW KING AND QUEEN on
conditions.--Act of Poll-money came forth, sparing none.--Now appeared
the Act of Indulgence for the Dissenters, but not exempting them from
paying dues to the Church of England clergy, or serving in office
according to law, with several other clauses.--A most splendid embassy
from Holland to congratulate the King and Queen on their accession to
the crown.A solemn fast for success of the fleet, etc.I dined with the Bishop of Asaph; Monsieur Capellus, the
learned son of the most learned Ludovicus, presented to him his father's
works, not published till now.I visited the Archbishop of Canterbury, and stayed with
him till about seven o'clock.He read to me the Pope's excommunication
of the French King.Burnet, now Bishop of Sarum; got him to let
Mr.King James's declaration was now dispersed, offering
pardon to all, if on his landing, or within twenty days after, they
should return to their obedience.Our fleet not yet at sea, through some prodigious sloth, and men minding
only their present interest; the French riding masters at sea, taking
many great prizes to our wonderful reproach.No certain news from
Ireland; various reports of Scotland; discontents at home.The King of
Denmark at last joins with the Confederates, and the two Northern Powers
are reconciled.The East India Company likely to be dissolved by
Parliament for many arbitrary actions.Oates acquitted of perjury, to
all honest men's admiration.News of A PLOT discovered, on which divers were sent to
the Tower and secured.An extraordinary drought, to the threatening of great
wants as to the fruits of the earth.Pepys,
late Secretary to the Admiralty, holding my "Sylva" in my right hand.It
was on his long and earnest request, and is placed in his library.Kneller never painted in a more masterly manner.I dined at Lord Clarendon's, it being his lady's
wedding day, when about three in the afternoon there was an unusual and
violent storm of thunder, rain, and wind; many boats on the Thames were
overwhelmed, and such was the impetuosity of the wind as to carry up the
waves in pillars and spouts most dreadful to behold, rooting up trees
and ruining some houses.The Countess of Sunderland afterward told me
that it extended as far as Althorpe at the very time, which is seventy
miles from London.It did no harm at Deptford, but at Greenwich it did
much mischief.I went to Hampton Court about business, the Council
being there.A great apartment and spacious garden with fountains was
beginning in the park at the head of the canal.The Marshal de Schomberg went now as General toward
Ireland, to the relief of Londonderry.The
Confederates passing the Rhine, besiege Bonn and Mayence, to obtain a
passage into France.A great victory gotten by the Muscovites, taking
and burning Perecop.A new rebel against the Turks threatens the
destruction of that tyranny.All Europe in arms against France, and
hardly to be found in history so universal a face of war.The Convention (or Parliament as some called it) sitting, exempt the
Duke of Hanover from the succession to the crown, which they seem to
confine to the present new King, his wife, and Princess Anne of Denmark,
who is so monstrously swollen, that it is doubted whether her being
thought with child may prove a TYMPANY only, so that the unhappy family
of the Stuarts seems to be extinguishing; and then what government is
likely to be next set up is unknown, whether regal and by election, or
otherwise, the Republicans and Dissenters from the Church of England
evidently looking that way.The Scots have now again voted down Episcopacy there.Great discontents
through this nation at the slow proceedings of the King, and the
incompetent instruments and officers he advances to the greatest and
most necessary charges.Hitherto it has been a most seasonable summer.Londonderry relieved after a brave and wonderful holding out.I went to visit the Archbishop of Canterbury since
his suspension, and was received with great kindness.A dreadful fire
happened in Southwark.Came to visit us the Marquis de Ruvigne, and one
Monsieur le Coque, a French refugee, who left great riches for his
religion; a very learned, civil person; he married the sister of the
Duchess de la Force.Ottobone, a Venetian Cardinal, eighty years old,
made Pope.[72]

    [Footnote 72: Peter Otthobonus succeeded Innocent XI.as Pope in
    1689, by the title of Alexander VIII.]My birthday, being now sixty-nine years old.Blessed
Father, who hast prolonged my years to this great age, and given me to
see so great and wonderful revolutions, and preserved me amid them to
this moment, accept, I beseech thee, the continuance of my prayers and
thankful acknowledgments, and grant me grace to be working out my
salvation and redeeming the time, that thou mayst be glorified by me
here, and my immortal soul saved whenever thou shalt call for it, to
perpetuate thy praises to all eternity, in that heavenly kingdom where
there are no more changes or vicissitudes, but rest, and peace, and joy,
and consummate felicity, forever.Grant this, O heavenly Father, for the
sake of Jesus thine only Son and our Savior.Asaph, Lord Almoner, preached
before the King and Queen, the whole discourse being an historical
narrative of the Church of England's several deliverances, especially
that of this anniversary, signalized by being also the birthday of the
Prince of Orange, his marriage (which was on the 4th), and his landing
at Torbay this day.There was a splendid ball and other rejoicings.After a very wet season, the winter came on
severely.Much wet, without frost, yet the wind north and
easterly.A Convocation of the Clergy meet about a reformation of our
Liturgy, Canons, etc., obstructed by others of the clergy.[Sidenote: LONDON]

27th November, 1689.I went to London with my family, to winter at Soho,
in the great square.This night there was a most extraordinary storm
of wind, accompanied with snow and sharp weather; it did great harm in
many places, blowing down houses, trees, etc., killing many people.It
began about two in the morning, and lasted till five, being a kind of
hurricane, which mariners observe have begun of late years to come
northward.This winter has been hitherto extremely wet, warm, and windy.Ann's Church an exhortatory
letter to the clergy of London from the Bishop, together with a Brief
for relieving the distressed Protestants, and Vaudois, who fled from the
persecution of the French and Duke of Savoy, to the Protestant Cantons
of Switzerland.The Parliament was unexpectedly prorogued to 2d of April to the
discontent and surprise of many members who, being exceedingly averse to
the settling of anything, proceeding with animosities, multiplying
exceptions against those whom they pronounced obnoxious, and producing
as universal a discontent against King William and themselves, as there
was before against King James.The new King resolved on an expedition
into Ireland in person.About 150 of the members who were of the more
royal party, meeting at a feast at the Apollo Tavern near St.Dunstan's,
sent some of their company to the King, to assure him of their service;
he returned his thanks, advising them to repair to their several
counties and preserve the peace during his absence, and assuring them
that he would be steady to his resolution of defending the Laws and
Religion established.The great Lord suspected to have counselled this
prorogation, universally denied it.However, it was believed the chief
adviser was the Marquis of Carmarthen, who now seemed to be most in
favor.The Parliament was dissolved by proclamation, and
another called to meet the 20th of March.This was a second surprise to
the former members; and now the Court party, or, as they call
themselves, Church of England, are making their interests in the
country.The Marquis of Halifax lays down his office of Privy Seal, and
pretends to retire.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th February, 1690.The Duchess of Monmouth's chaplain preached at St.Martin's an excellent discourse exhorting to peace and sanctity, it
being now the time of very great division and dissension in the nation;
first, among the Churchmen, of whom the moderate and sober part were for
a speedy reformation of divers things, which it was thought might be
made in our Liturgy, for the inviting of Dissenters; others more stiff
and rigid, were for no condescension at all.Books and pamphlets were
published every day pro and con; the Convocation were forced for the
present to suspend any further progress.There was fierce and great
carousing about being elected in the new Parliament.The King persists
in his intention of going in person for Ireland, whither the French are
sending supplies to King James, and we, the Danish horse to Schomberg.I dined with the Marquis of Carmarthen (late Lord
Danby), where was Lieutenant-General Douglas, a very considerate and
sober commander, going for Ireland.He related to us the exceeding
neglect of the English soldiers, suffering severely for want of clothes
and necessaries this winter, exceedingly magnifying their courage and
bravery during all their hardships.There dined also Lord Lucas,
Lieutenant of the Tower, and the Bishop of St.The Privy Seal was
again put in commission, Mr.Cheny (who married my kinswoman, Mrs.Pierrepoint), Sir Thomas Knatchbull, and Sir P. W. Pultney.The
imprudence of both sexes was now become so great and universal, persons
of all ranks keeping their courtesans publicly, that the King had lately
directed a letter to the Bishops to order their clergy to preach against
that sin, swearing, etc., and to put the ecclesiastical laws in
execution without any indulgence.I went to Kensington, which King William had bought
of Lord Nottingham, and altered, but was yet a patched building, but
with the garden, however, it is a very sweet villa, having to it the
park and a straight new way through this park.Pepys, late Secretary to the
Admiralty, where was that excellent shipwright and seaman (for so he had
been, and also a Commission of the Navy), Sir Anthony Deane.Among other
discourse, and deploring the sad condition of our navy, as now governed
by inexperienced men since this Revolution, he mentioned what exceeding
advantage we of this nation had by being the first who built frigates,
the first of which ever built was that vessel which was afterward called
"The Constant Warwick," and was the work of Pett of Chatham, for a trial
of making a vessel that would sail swiftly; it was built with low decks,
the guns lying near the water, and was so light and swift of sailing,
that in a short time he told us she had, ere the Dutch war was ended,
taken as much money from privateers as would have laden her; and that
more such being built, did in a year or two scour the Channel from those
of Dunkirk and others which had exceedingly infested it.He added that
it would be the best and only infallible expedient to be masters of the
sea, and able to destroy the greatest navy of any enemy if, instead of
building huge great ships and second and third rates, they would leave
off building such high decks, which were for nothing but to gratify
gentlemen-commanders, who must have all their effeminate accommodations,
and for pomp; that it would be the ruin of our fleets, if such persons
were continued in command, they neither having experience nor being
capable of learning, because they would not submit to the fatigue and
inconvenience which those who were bred seamen would undergo, in those
so otherwise useful swift frigates.These being to encounter the
greatest ships would be able to protect, set on, and bring off, those
who should manage the fire ships, and the Prince who should first store
himself with numbers of such fire ships, would, through the help and
countenance of such frigates, be able to ruin the greatest force of such
vast ships as could be sent to sea, by the dexterity of working those
light, swift ships to guard the fire ships.He concluded there would
shortly be no other method of seafight; and that great ships and
men-of-war, however stored with guns and men, must submit to those who
should encounter them with far less number.He represented to us the
dreadful effect of these fire ships; that he continually observed in our
late maritime war with the Dutch that, when an enemy's fire ship
approached, the most valiant commander and common sailors were in such
consternation, that though then, of all times, there was most need of
the guns, bombs, etc., to keep the mischief off, they grew pale and
astonished, as if of a quite other mean soul, that they slunk about,
forsook their guns and work as if in despair, every one looking about to
see which way they might get out of their ship, though sure to be
drowned if they did so.This he said was likely to prove hereafter the
method of seafight, likely to be the misfortune of England if they
continued to put gentlemen-commanders over experienced seamen, on
account of their ignorance, effeminacy, and insolence.[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th March, 1690.Burnet, late Bishop of Sarum,
on Heb.13, anatomically describing the texture of the eye; and
that, as it received such innumerable sorts of spies through so very
small a passage to the brain, and that without the least confusion or
trouble, and accordingly judged and reflected on them; so God who made
this sensory, did with the greatest ease and at once see all that was
done through the vast universe, even to the very thought as well as
action.This similitude he continued with much perspicuity and aptness;
and applied it accordingly, for the admonishing us how uprightly we
ought to live and behave ourselves before such an all-seeing Deity; and
how we were to conceive of other his attributes, which we could have no
idea of than by comparing them by what we were able to conceive of the
nature and power of things, which were the objects of our senses; and
therefore it was that in Scripture we attribute those actions and
affections of God by the same of man, not as adequately or in any
proportion like them, but as the only expedient to make some resemblance
of his divine perfections; as when the Scripture says, "God will
remember the sins of the penitent no more:" not as if God could forget
anything, but as intimating he would pass by such penitents and receive
them to mercy.Asaph's, Almoner to the new Queen, with
the famous lawyer Sir George Mackenzie (late Lord Advocate of Scotland),
against whom both the Bishop and myself had written and published books,
but now most friendly reconciled.[73] He related to us many particulars
of Scotland, the present sad condition of it, the inveterate hatred
which the Presbyterians show to the family of the Stuarts, and the
exceeding tyranny of those bigots who acknowledge no superior on earth,
in civil or divine matters, maintaining that the people only have the
right of government; their implacable hatred to the Episcopal Order and
Church of England.He observed that the first Presbyterian dissents from
our discipline were introduced by the Jesuits' order, about the 20 of
Queen Elizabeth, a famous Jesuit among them feigning himself a
Protestant, and who was the first who began to pray extempore, and
brought in that which they since called, and are still so fond of,
praying by the Spirit.This Jesuit remained many years before he was
discovered, afterward died in Scotland, where he was buried at...
having yet on his monument, "_Rosa inter spinas_."[Footnote 73: Sir George, as we have seen, had written in praise of
    a Private Life, which Mr.Evelyn answered by a book in praise of
    Public Life and Active Employment.]Charlton's curiosities, both
of art and nature, and his full and rare collection of medals, which
taken altogether, in all kinds, is doubtless one of the most perfect
assemblages of rarities that can be any where seen.I much admired the
contortions of the Thea root, which was so perplexed, large, and
intricate, and withal hard as box, that it was wonderful to consider.King William set forth on his Irish expedition, leaving
the Queen Regent.Pepys read to me his Remonstrance, showing with
what malice and injustice he was suspected with Sir Anthony Deane about
the timber, of which the thirty ships were built by a late Act of
Parliament, with the exceeding danger which the fleet would shortly be
in, by reason of the tyranny and incompetency of those who now managed
the Admiralty and affairs of the Navy, of which he gave an accurate
state, and showed his great ability.Asaph; his
conversation was on the Vaudois in Savoy, who had been thought so near
destruction and final extirpation by the French, being totally given up
to slaughter, so that there were no hopes for them; but now it pleased
God that the Duke of Savoy, who had hitherto joined with the French in
their persecution, being now pressed by them to deliver up Saluzzo and
Turin as cautionary towns, on suspicion that he might at last come into
the Confederacy of the German Princes, did secretly concert measures
with, and afterward declared for, them.He then invited these poor
people from their dispersion among the mountains whither they had fled,
and restored them to their country, their dwellings, and the exercise of
their religion, and begged pardon for the ill usage they had received,
charging it on the cruelty of the French who forced him to it.These
being the remainder of those persecuted Christians which the Bishop of
St.Asaph had so long affirmed to be the two witnesses spoken of in the
Revelation, who should be killed and brought to life again, it was
looked on as an extraordinary thing that this prophesying Bishop should
persuade two fugitive ministers of the Vaudois to return to their
country, and furnish them with L20 toward their journey, at that very
time when nothing but universal destruction was to be expected, assuring
them and showing them from the Apocalypse, that their countrymen should
be returned safely to their country before they arrived.This happening
contrary to all expectation and appearance, did exceedingly credit the
Bishop's confidence how that prophecy of the witnesses should come to
pass, just at the time, and the very month, he had spoken of some years
before.Boyle and Lady Ranelagh his sister, to
whom he explained the necessity of it so fully, and so learnedly made
out, with what events were immediately to follow, viz, the French King's
ruin, the calling of the Jews to be near at hand, but that the Kingdom
of Antichrist would not yet be utterly destroyed till thirty years, when
Christ should begin the Millenium, not as personally and visibly
reigning on earth, but that the true religion and universal peace should
obtain through all the world.Mede, and
other interpreters of these events failed, by mistaking and reckoning
the year as the Latins and others did, to consist of the present
calculation, so many days to the year, whereas the Apocalypse reckons
after the Persian account, as Daniel did, whose visions St.John all
along explains as meaning only the Christian Church.Pepys, who the next day was sent to the
Gatehouse,[74] and several great persons to the Tower, on suspicion of
being affected to King James; among them was the Earl of Clarendon, the
Queen's uncle.King William having vanquished King James in Ireland,
there was much public rejoicing.It seems the Irish in King James's army
would not stand, but the English-Irish and French made great resistance.Walker, who so bravely defended
Londonderry.King William received a slight wound by the grazing of a
cannon bullet on his shoulder, which he endured with very little
interruption of his pursuit.Hamilton, who broke his word about
Tyrconnel, was taken.It is reported that King James is gone back to
France.Drogheda and Dublin surrendered, and if King William be
returning, we may say of him as Caesar said, "_Veni, vidi, vici_."But to
alloy much of this, the French fleet rides in our channel, ours not
daring to interpose, and the enemy threatening to land.[Footnote 74: Poor Pepys, as the reader knows, had already undergone
    an imprisonment, with perhaps just as much reason as the present, on
    the absurd accusation of having sent information to the French Court
    of the state of the English Navy.][Sidenote: LONDON]

27th June, 1690.I went to visit some friends in the Tower, when asking
for Lord Clarendon, they by mistake directed me to the Earl of
Torrington, who about three days before had been sent for from the
fleet, and put into the Tower for cowardice and not fighting the French
fleet, which having beaten a squadron of the Hollanders, while
Torrington did nothing, did now ride masters of the sea, threatening a
descent.This afternoon a camp of about 4,000 men was begun to
be formed on Blackheath.Pepys, now suffered to return to his
house, on account of indisposition.The Duke of Grafton came to visit me, going to his
ship at the mouth of the river, in his way to Ireland (where he was
slain).The French landed some soldiers at Teignmouth, in
Devon, and burned some poor houses.The French fleet still hovering
about the western coast, and we having 300 sail of rich merchant-ships
in the bay of Plymouth, our fleet began to move toward them, under three
admirals.The country in the west all on their guard.A very
extraordinary fine season; but on the 12th was a very great storm of
thunder and lightning, and on the 15th the season much changed to wet
and cold.The militia and trained bands, horse and foot, which were up
through England, were dismissed.The French King having news that King
William was slain, and his army defeated in Ireland, caused such a
triumph at Paris, and all over France, as was never heard of; when, in
the midst of it, the unhappy King James being vanquished, by a speedy
flight and escape, himself brought the news of his own defeat.I was desired to be one of the bail of the Earl of
Clarendon, for his release from the Tower, with divers noblemen.Asaph expounds his prophecies to me and Mr.The troops from Blackheath march to Portsmouth.That sweet and hopeful
youth, Sir Charles Tuke, died of the wounds he received in the fight of
the Boyne, to the great sorrow of all his friends, being (I think) the
last male of that family, to which my wife is related.A more virtuous
young gentleman I never knew; he was learned for his age, having had the
advantage of the choicest breeding abroad, both as to arts and arms; he
had traveled much, but was so unhappy as to fall in the side of his
unfortunate King.The unseasonable and most tempestuous weather happening, the naval
expedition is hindered, and the extremity of wet causes the siege of
Limerick to be raised, King William returned to England.Lord Sidney
left Governor of what is conquered in Ireland, which is near three parts
[in four].An extraordinary sharp, cold, east
wind.The French General, with Tyrconnel and their
forces, gone back to France, beaten out by King William.The Duke of Grafton was there mortally wounded and dies.The 8th of this month Lord Spencer wrote me
word from Althorpe, that there happened an earthquake the day before in
the morning, which, though short, sensibly shook the house.The
"Gazette" acquainted us that the like happened at the same time,
half-past seven, at Barnstaple, Holyhead, and Dublin.We were not
sensible of it here.Kinsale at last surrendered, meantime King James's
party burn all the houses they have in their power, and among them that
stately palace of Lord Ossory's, which lately cost, as reported,
L40,000.By a disastrous accident, a third-rate ship, the Breda, blew up
and destroyed all on board; in it were twenty-five prisoners of war.She
was to have sailed for England the next day.Went to the Countess of Clancarty, to condole with
her concerning her debauched and dissolute son, who had done so much
mischief in Ireland, now taken and brought prisoner to the Tower.Exceeding great storms, yet a warm season.Pepys's memorials to Lord Godolphin, now
resuming the commission of the Treasury, to the wonder of all his
friends.Having been chosen President of the Royal Society, I
desired to decline it, and with great difficulty devolved the election
on Sir Robert Southwell, Secretary of State to King William in Ireland.Hough, President of Magdalen College, Oxford,
who was displaced with several of the Fellows for not taking the oath
imposed by King James, now made a Bishop.Most of this month cold and
frost.One Johnson, a Knight, was executed at Tyburn for being an
accomplice with Campbell, brother to Lord Argyle, in stealing a young
heiress.This week a PLOT was discovered for a general
rising against the new Government, for which (Henry) Lord Clarendon and
others were sent to the Tower.The next day, I went to see Lord
Clarendon.Trial of Lord Preston, as not
being an English Peer, hastened at the Old Bailey.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th January, 1691.Lord Preston condemned about a design to bring in
King James by the French.I went to visit Monsieur Justell and the Library at
St.James's, in which that learned man had put the MSS.(which were in
good number) into excellent order, they having lain neglected for many
years.Divers medals had been stolen and embezzled.Dined at Sir William Fermor's, who showed me many good
pictures.After dinner, a French servant played rarely on the lute.Sir
William had now bought all the remaining statues collected with so much
expense by the famous Thomas, Earl of Arundel, and sent them to his seat
at Easton, near Towcester.[75]

    [Footnote 75: They are now at Oxford, having been presented to the
    University in 1755 by Henrietta, Countess Dowager of Pomfret, widow
    of Thomas, the first Earl.]Lord Sidney, principal Secretary of State, gave me a
letter to Lord Lucas, Lieutenant of the Tower, to permit me to visit
Lord Clarendon; which this day I did, and dined with him.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th April, 1691.This night, a sudden and terrible fire burned down all
the buildings over the stone gallery at Whitehall to the water side,
beginning at the apartment of the late Duchess of Portsmouth (which had
been pulled down and rebuilt no less than three times to please her),
and consuming other lodgings of such lewd creatures, who debauched both
King Charles II.The King returned out of Holland just as this accident
happened--Proclamation against the <DW7>s, etc.Sloane's curiosities, being an
universal collection of the natural productions of Jamaica, consisting
of plants, fruits, corals, minerals, stones, earth, shells, animals, and
insects, collected with great judgment; several folios of dried plants,
and one which had about 80 several sorts of ferns, and another of
grasses; the Jamaica pepper, in branch, leaves, flower, fruit, etc.This
collection,[76] with his Journal and other philosophical and natural
discourses and observations, indeed very copious and extraordinary,
sufficient to furnish a history of that island, to which I encouraged
him.[Footnote 76: It now forms part of the collection in the British
    Museum.]The Archbishop of Canterbury, and Bishops of Ely, Bath
and Wells, Peterborough, Gloucester, and the rest who would not take the
oaths to King William, were now displaced; and in their rooms, Dr.Paul's, was made Archbishop: Patrick removed from
Chichester to Ely; Cumberland to Gloucester.I dined with Lord Clarendon in the Tower.I visited the Earl and Countess of Sunderland, now
come to kiss the King's hand after his return from Holland.I went to visit the Archbishop of Canterbury [Sancroft]
yet at Lambeth.I found him alone, and discoursing of the times,
especially of the newly designed Bishops; he told me that by no canon or
divine law they could justify the removing of the present incumbents;
that Dr.Beveridge, designed Bishop of Bath and Wells, came to ask his
advice; that the Archbishop told him, though he should give it, he
believed he would not take it; the Doctor said he would; why then, says
the Archbishop, when they come to ask, say "_Nolo_," and say it from the
heart; there is nothing easier than to resolve yourself what is to be
done in the case: the Doctor seemed to deliberate.What he will do I
know not, but Bishop Ken, who is to be put out, is exceedingly beloved
in his diocese; and, if he and the rest should insist on it, and plead
their interest as freeholders, it is believed there would be difficulty
in their case, and it may endanger a schism and much disturbance, so as
wise men think it had been better to have let them alone, than to have
proceeded with this rigor to turn them out for refusing to swear against
their consciences.I asked at parting, when his Grace removed; he said
that he had not yet received any summons, but I found the house
altogether disfurnished and his books packed up.I went with my son, and brother-in-law, Glanville, and
his son, to Wotton, to solemnize the funeral of my nephew, which was
performed the next day very decently and orderly by the herald in the
afternoon, a very great appearance of the country being there.I was the
chief mourner; the pall was held by Sir Francis Vincent, Sir Richard
Onslow, Mr.Thomas Howard (son to Sir Robert, and Captain of the King's
Guard), Mr.Herbert, nephew to Lord Herbert of
Cherbury, and cousin-german to my deceased nephew.He was laid in the
vault at Wotton Church, in the burying place of the family.A great
concourse of coaches and people accompanied the solemnity.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th June, 1691.I went to visit Lord Clarendon, still prisoner in the
Tower, though Lord Preston being pardoned was released.Cumberland, the
new Bishop of Norwich,[77] Dr.Lloyd having been put out for not
acknowledging the Government.Cumberland is a very learned, excellent
man.Tillotson, at Lambeth, by the
Sheriff; Archbishop Sancroft was gone, but had left his nephew to keep
possession; and he refusing to deliver it up on the Queen's message, was
dispossessed by the Sheriff, and imprisoned.This stout demeanor of the
few Bishops who refused to take the oaths to King William, animated a
great party to forsake the churches, so as to threaten a schism; though
those who looked further into the ancient practice, found that when (as
formerly) there were Bishops displaced on secular accounts, the people
never refused to acknowledge the new Bishops, provided they were not
heretics.The truth is, the whole clergy had till now stretched the duty
of passive obedience, so that the proceedings against these Bishops gave
no little occasion of exceptions; but this not amounting to heresy,
there was a necessity of receiving the new Bishops, to prevent a failure
of that order in the Church.I went to visit Lord Clarendon in the
Tower, but he was gone into the country for air by the Queen's
permission, under the care of his warden.Cumberland was made Bishop of
    Peterborough and Dr.Lloyd in the see of
    Norwich.]Stringfellow preach his first
sermon in the newly erected Church of Trinity, in Conduit Street; to
which I did recommend him to Dr.Tenison for the constant preacher and
lecturer.This Church, formerly built of timber on Hounslow-Heath by
King James for the mass priests, being begged by Dr.Martin's, was set up by that public-minded, charitable, and pious
man near my son's dwelling in Dover Street, chiefly at the charge of the
Doctor.I know him to be an excellent preacher and a fit person.Martin's, which is the Doctor's parish, he
was not only content, but was the sole industrious mover, that it should
be made a separate parish, in regard of the neighborhood having become
so populous.Wherefore to countenance and introduce the new minister,
and take possession of a gallery designed for my son's family, I went to
London, where,

19th July, 1691.Tenison preached the first sermon,
taking his text from Psalm xxvi."Lord, I have loved the habitation
of thy house, and the place where thine honor dwelleth."In concluding,
he gave that this should be made a parish church so soon as the
Parliament sat, and was to be dedicated to the Holy Trinity, in honor of
the three undivided persons in the Deity; and he minded them to attend
to that faith of the church, now especially that Arianism, Socinianism,
and atheism began to spread among us.Stringfellow
preached on Luke vii."The centurion who had built a synagogue."He
proceeded to the due praise of persons of such public spirit, and thence
to such a character of pious benefactors in the person of the generous
centurion, as was comprehensive of all the virtues of an accomplished
Christian, in a style so full, eloquent, and moving, that I never heard
a sermon more apposite to the occasion.He modestly insinuated the
obligation they had to that person who should be the author and promoter
of such public works for the benefit of mankind, especially to the
advantage of religion, such as building and endowing churches,
hospitals, libraries, schools, procuring the best editions of useful
books, by which he handsomely intimated who it was that had been so
exemplary for his benefaction to that place.Tenison, had also erected and furnished a public library [in
St.Martin's]; and set up two or three free schools at his own charges.Besides this, he was of an exemplary, holy life, took great pains in
constantly preaching, and incessantly employing himself to promote the
service of God both in public and private.I never knew a man of a more
universal and generous spirit, with so much modesty, prudence, and
piety.The great victory of King William's army in Ireland was looked on as
decisive of that war.Ruth, who had been so
cruel to the poor Protestants in France, was slain, with divers of the
best commanders; nor was it cheap to us, having 1,000 killed, but of the
enemy 4,000 or 5,000.An extraordinary hot season, yet refreshed by some
thundershowers.No sermon in the church in the afternoon, and the
curacy ill-served.A sermon by the curate; an honest discourse, but read
without any spirit, or seeming concern; a great fault in the education
of young preachers.Great thunder and lightning on Thursday, but the
rain and wind very violent.Our fleet come in to lay up the great ships;
nothing done at sea, pretending that we cannot meet the French.A great storm at sea; we lost the "Coronation" and
"Harwich," above 600 men perishing.Our navy come in without
having performed anything, yet there has been great loss of ships by
negligence, and unskillful men governing the fleet and Navy board.I visited the Earl of Dover, who having made his
peace with the King, was now come home.The relation he gave of the
strength of the French King, and the difficulty of our forcing him to
fight, and any way making impression into France, was very wide from
what we fancied.8th to 30th November, 1691.An extraordinary dry and warm season,
without frost, and like a new spring; such as had not been known for
many years.Part of the King's house at Kensington was burned.Discourse of another PLOT, in which several great
persons were named, but believed to be a sham.--A proposal in the House
of Commons that every officer in the whole nation who received a salary
above L500 or otherwise by virtue of his office, should contribute it
wholly to the support of the war with France, and this upon their oath.My daughter-in-law was brought to bed of a
daughter.An exceedingly dry and calm winter; no rain for
many past months.Dined at Lambeth with the new Archbishop.Saw the
effect of my greenhouse furnace, set up by the Archbishop's son-in-law.Charlton's collection of spiders,
birds, scorpions, and other serpents, etc.This last week died that pious, admirable
Christian, excellent philosopher, and my worthy friend, Mr.Boyle, aged
about 65,--a great loss to all that knew him, and to the public.[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th January, 1692.Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, preached on Eccles.He concluded
with an eulogy due to the deceased, who made God and religion the scope
of all his excellent talents in the knowledge of nature, and who had
arrived to so high a degree in it, accompanied with such zeal and
extraordinary piety, which he showed in the whole course of his life,
particularly in his exemplary charity on all occasions,--that he gave
L1,000 yearly to the distressed refugees of France and Ireland; was at
the charge of translating the Scriptures into the Irish and Indian
tongues, and was now promoting a Turkish translation, as he had formerly
done of Grotius "on the Truth of the Christian Religion" into Arabic,
which he caused to be dispersed in the eastern countries; that he had
settled a fund for preachers who should preach expressly against
Atheists, Libertines, Socinians, and Jews; that he had in his will given
L8,000 to charitable uses; but that his private charities were
extraordinary.He dilated on his learning in Hebrew and Greek, his
reading of the fathers, and solid knowledge in theology, once
deliberating about taking Holy Orders, and that at the time of
restoration of King Charles II., when he might have made a great figure
in the nation as to secular honor and titles, his fear of not being able
to discharge so weighty a duty as the first, made him decline that, and
his humility the other.He spoke of his civility to strangers, the great
good which he did by his experience in medicine and chemistry, and to
what noble ends he applied himself to his darling studies; the works,
both pious and useful, which he published; the exact life he led, and
the happy end he made.Something was touched of his sister, the Lady
Ranelagh, who died but a few days before him.And truly all this was but
his due, without any grain of flattery.This week a most execrable murder was committed on Dr.Clench, father of
that extraordinary learned child whom I have before noticed.Under
pretense of carrying him in a coach to see a patient, they strangled him
in it; and, sending away the coachman under some pretense, they left his
dead body in the coach, and escaped in the dusk of the evening.Tenison, now
Bishop of Lincoln, in Trinity Church, being the first that was
christened there.A frosty and dry season continued; many persons die
of apoplexy, more than usual.Lord Marlborough, Lieutenant-General of
the King's army in England, gentleman of the bedchamber, etc., dismissed
from all his charges, military and other, for his excessive taking of
bribes, covetousness, and extortion on all occasions from his inferior
officers.Note, this was the Lord who was entirely advanced by King
James, and was the first who betrayed and forsook his master.He was son
of Sir Winston Churchill of the Greencloth.Boyle having made me one of the trustees for
his charitable bequests, I went to a meeting of the Bishop of Lincoln,
Sir Rob.... wood, and serjeant, Rotheram, to settle that clause in the
will which related to charitable uses, and especially the appointing and
electing a minister to preach one sermon the first Sunday in the month,
during the four summer months, expressly against Atheists, Deists,
Libertines, Jews, etc., without descending to any other controversy
whatever, for which L50 per annum is to be paid quarterly to the
preacher; and, at the end of three years, to proceed to a new election
of some other able divine, or to continue the same, as the trustees
should judge convenient.Bentley, chaplain to
the Bishop of Worcester (Dr.The first sermon was
appointed for the first Sunday in March, at St.Martin's; the second
Sunday in April, at Bow Church, and so alternately.Lord Marlborough having used words against the
King, and been discharged from all his great places, his wife was
forbidden the Court, and the Princess of Denmark was desired by the
Queen to dismiss her from her service; but she refusing to do so, goes
away from Court to Sion house.Divers new Lords made: Sir Henry Capel,
Sir William Fermor, etc.The
Parliament adjourned, not well satisfied with affairs.The business of
the East India Company, which they would have reformed, let fall.The
Duke of Norfolk does not succeed in his endeavor to be divorced.[78]

    [Footnote 78: See _post_ pp.My son was made one of the Commissioners of the
Revenue and Treasury of Ireland, to which employment he had a mind, far
from my wishes.I visited the Earl of Peterborough, who showed me the
picture of the Prince of Wales, newly brought out of France, seeming in
my opinion very much to resemble the Queen his mother, and of a most
vivacious countenance.The Queen Dowager went out of
England toward Portugal, as pretended, against the advice of all her
friends.So excellent a discourse against the Epicurean system is
not to be recapitulated in a few words.He came to me to ask whether I
thought it should be printed, or that there was anything in it which I
desired to be altered.I took this as a civility, and earnestly desired
it should be printed, as one of the most learned and convincing
discourses I had ever heard.King James sends a letter written and directed
by his own hand to several of the Privy Council, and one to his
daughter, the Queen Regent, informing them of the Queen being ready to
be brought to bed, and summoning them to be at the birth by the middle
of May, promising as from the French King, permission to come and return
in safety.Much apprehension of a French invasion, and of an
universal rising.Unkindness
between the Queen and her sister.Very cold and unseasonable weather,
scarce a leaf on the trees.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th May, 1692.Reports of an invasion were very hot, and alarmed the
city, Court, and people; nothing but securing suspected persons, sending
forces to the seaside, and hastening out the fleet.Continued discourse
of the French invasion, and of ours in France.The eastern wind so
constantly blowing, gave our fleet time to unite, which had been so
tardy in preparation, that, had not God thus wonderfully favored, the
enemy would in all probability have fallen upon us.Many daily secured,
and proclamations out for more conspirators.My kinsman, Sir Edward Evelyn, of Long Ditton, died
suddenly.I dined at my cousin Cheny's, son to my Lord Cheny, who
married my cousin Pierpoint.My niece, M. Evelyn, was now married to Sir Cyril Wyche,
Secretary of State for Ireland.After all our apprehensions of being
invaded, and doubts of our success by sea, it pleased God to give us a
great naval victory, to the utter ruin of the French fleet, their
admiral and all their best men-of-war, transport-ships, etc.Though this day was set apart expressly for celebrating
the memorable birth, return, and restoration of the late King Charles
II., there was no notice taken of it, nor any part of the office annexed
to the Common Prayer Book made use of, which I think was ill done, in
regard his restoration not only redeemed us from anarchy and confusion,
but restored the Church of England as it were miraculously.I went to Windsor to carry my grandson to Eton School,
where I met my Lady Stonehouse and other of my daughter-in-law's
relations, who came on purpose to see her before her journey into
Ireland.We went to see the castle, which we found furnished and very
neatly kept, as formerly, only that the arms in the guard chamber and
keep were removed and carried away.An exceeding great storm of wind and
rain, in some places stripping the trees of their fruit and leaves as if
it had been winter; and an extraordinary wet season, with great floods.I went with my wife, son, and daughter, to Eton, to see
my grandson, and thence to my Lord Godolphin's, at Cranburn, where we
lay, and were most honorably entertained.George's
Chapel, and returned to London late in the evening.Hewer's at Clapham, where he has an excellent,
useful, and capacious house on the Common, built by Sir Den.Gauden, and
by him sold to Mr.Hewer, who got a very considerable estate in the
Navy, in which, from being Mr.Pepys's clerk, he came to be one of the
principal officers, but was put out of all employment on the Revolution,
as were all the best officers, on suspicion of being no friends to the
change; such were put in their places, as were most shamefully ignorant
and unfit.Hewer lives very handsomely and friendly to everybody.Our fleet was now sailing on their long pretense of a descent on the
French coast; but, after having sailed one hundred leagues, returned,
the admiral and officers disagreeing as to the place where they were to
land, and the time of year being so far spent,--to the great dishonor of
those at the helm, who concerted their matters so indiscreetly, or, as
some thought, designedly.This whole summer was exceedingly wet and rainy, the like had not been
known since the year 1648; while in Ireland they had not known so great
a drought.I went to visit the Bishop of Lincoln, when, among
other things, he told me that one Dr.Chaplin, of University College in
Oxford, was the person who wrote the "Whole Duty of Man"; that he used
to read it to his pupil, and communicated it to Dr.Sterne, afterward
Archbishop of York, but would never suffer any of his pupils to have a
copy of it.Came the sad news of the hurricane and
earthquake, which has destroyed almost the whole Island of Jamaica, many
thousands having perished.My son, his wife, and little daughter, went for
Ireland, there to reside as one of the Commissioners of the Revenue.There happened an earthquake, which, though not so
great as to do any harm in England, was universal in all these parts of
Europe.It shook the house at Wotton, but was not perceived by any save
a servant or two, who were making my bed, and another in a garret.I and
the rest being at dinner below in the parlor, were not sensible of it.The dreadful one in Jamaica this summer was profanely and ludicrously
represented in a puppet play, or some such lewd pastime, in the fair of
Southwark, which caused the Queen to put down that idle and vicious mock
show.This season was so exceedingly cold, by reason of a
long and tempestuous northeast wind, that this usually pleasant month
was very uncomfortable.Harbord dies at
Belgrade; Lord Paget sent Ambassador in his room.There was a vestry called about repairing or new
building of the church [at Deptford], which I thought unseasonable in
regard of heavy taxes, and other improper circumstances, which I there
declared.A solemn Thanksgiving for our victory at sea, safe
return of the King, etc.Lancaster, the new Vicar of St.A signal robbery in Hertfordshire of the tax money bringing out of the
north toward London.They were set upon by several desperate persons,
who dismounted and stopped all travelers on the road, and guarding them
in a field, when the exploit was done, and the treasure taken, they
killed all the horses of those whom they stayed, to hinder pursuit,
being sixteen horses.They then dismissed those that they had
dismounted.With much reluctance we gratified Sir J.
Rotherham, one of Mr.Boyle's trustees, by admitting the Bishop of Bath
and Wells to be lecturer for the next year, instead of Mr.Bentley, who
had so worthily acquitted himself.We intended to take him in again the
next year.[Sidenote: LONDON]

January, 1692-93.Contest in Parliament about a self-denying Act, that
no Parliament man should have any office; it wanted only two or three
voices to have been carried.The Duke of Norfolk's bill for a divorce
thrown out, he having managed it very indiscreetly.The quarrel between
Admiral Russell and Lord Nottingham yet undetermined.After five days' trial and extraordinary contest,
the Lord Mohun was acquitted by the Lords of the murder of Montford, the
player, notwithstanding the judges, from the pregnant witnesses of the
fact, had declared him guilty; but whether in commiseration of his
youth, being not eighteen years old, though exceedingly dissolute, or
upon whatever other reason, the King himself present some part of the
trial, and satisfied, as they report, that he was culpable.69 acquitted
him, only 14 condemned him.Unheard of stories of the universal increase of witches in New England;
men, women, and children, devoting themselves to the devil, so as to
threaten the subversion of the government.[79] At the same time there
was a conspiracy among the <DW64>s in Barbadoes to murder all their
masters, discovered by overhearing a discourse of two of the slaves, and
so preventing the execution of the design.France in the utmost misery and poverty for want of corn and
subsistence, while the ambitious King is intent to pursue his conquests
on the rest of his neighbors both by sea and land.Our Admiral, Russell,
laid aside for not pursuing the advantage he had obtained over the
French in the past summer; three others chosen in his place.Burnet,
Bishop of Salisbury's book burned by the hangman for an expression of
the King's title by conquest, on a complaint of Joseph How, a member of
Parliament, little better than a madman.[Footnote 79: Some account of these poor people is given in Bray and
    Manning's "History of Surrey," ii.Miller, Vicar of Effingham, in that county, who was chaplain to
    the King's forces in the colony from 1692 to 1695.Some of the
    accused were convicted and executed; but Sir William Phipps, the
    Governor, had the good sense to reprieve, and afterward pardon,
    several; and the Queen approved his conduct.]The Bishop of Lincoln preached in the afternoon at
the Tabernacle near Golden Square, set up by him.Proposals of a
marriage between Mr.Hitherto an
exceedingly warm winter, such as has seldom been known, and portending
an unprosperous spring as to the fruits of the earth; our climate
requires more cold and winterly weather.The dreadful and astonishing
earthquake swallowing up Catania, and other famous and ancient cities,
with more than 100,000 persons in Sicily, on 11th January last, came now
to be reported among us.An extraordinary deep snow, after almost no winter,
and a sudden gentle thaw.A deplorable earthquake at Malta, since that
of Sicily, nearly as great.A new Secretary of State, Sir John Trenchard; the
Attorney-General, Somers, made Lord-Keeper, a young lawyer of
extraordinary merit.King William goes toward Flanders; but returns, the
wind being contrary.I met the King going to Gravesend to embark in his
yacht for Holland.My daughter Susanna was married to William Draper,
Esq., in the chapel of Ely House, by Dr.Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln
(since Archbishop).I gave her in portion L4,000, her jointure is L500
per annum.I pray Almighty God to give his blessing to this marriage!She is a good child, religious, discreet, ingenious, and qualified with
all the ornaments of her sex.She has a peculiar talent in design, as
painting in oil and miniature, and an extraordinary genius for whatever
hands can do with a needle.She has the French tongue, has read most of
the Greek and Roman authors and poets, using her talents with great
modesty; exquisitely shaped, and of an agreeable countenance.This
character is due to her, though coming from her father.Much of this
week spent in ceremonies, receiving visits and entertaining relations,
and a great part of the next in returning visits.We accompanied my daughter to her husband's house,
where with many of his and our relations we were magnificently treated.There we left her in an apartment very richly adorned and furnished, and
I hope in as happy a condition as could be wished, and with the great
satisfaction of all our friends; for which God be praised!Muttering of a design
to bring forces under color of an expected descent, to be a standing
army for other purposes.Talk of a declaration of the French King,
offering mighty advantages to the confederates, exclusive of King
William; and another of King James, with an universal pardon, and
referring the composing of all differences to a Parliament.These were
yet but discourses; but something is certainly under it.A declaration
or manifesto from King James, so written, that many thought it
reasonable, and much more to the purpose than any of his former.I went to my Lord Griffith's chapel; the common
church office was used for the King without naming the person, with some
other, apposite to the necessity and circumstances of the time.I dined at Sir William Godolphin's; and, after evening
prayer, visited the Duchess of Grafton.I saw a great auction of pictures in the Banqueting
house, Whitehall.They had been my Lord Melford's, now Ambassador from
King James at Rome, and engaged to his creditors here.Lord Mulgrave and
Sir Edward Seymour came to my house, and desired me to go with them to
the sale.Divers more of the great lords, etc., were there, and bought
pictures dear enough.There were some very excellent of Vandyke, Rubens,
and Bassan.Lord Godolphin bought the picture of the Boys, by Murillo
the Spaniard, for 80 guineas, dear enough; my nephew Glanville, the old
Earl of Arundel's head by Rubens, for L20.Growing late, I did not stay
till all were sold.A very wet hay harvest, and little summer as yet.Parr at Camberwell,
preached an excellent sermon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

13th July, 1693.I saw the Queen's rare cabinets and collection of
china; which was wonderfully rich and plentiful, but especially a large
cabinet, looking-glass frame and stands, all of amber, much of it white,
with historical bas-reliefs and statues, with medals carved in them,
esteemed worth L4,000, sent by the Duke of Brandenburgh, whose country,
Prussia, abounds with amber, cast up by the sea; divers other China and
Indian cabinets, screens, and hangings.In her library were many books
in English, French, and Dutch, of all sorts; a cupboard of gold plate; a
cabinet of silver filagree, which I think was our Queen Mary's, and
which, in my opinion, should have been generously sent to her.I dined with Lord Mulgrave, with the Earl of
Devonshire, Mr.Hampden (a scholar and fine gentleman), Dr.Davenant,
Sir Henry Vane, and others, and saw and admired the Venus of Correggio,
which Lord Mulgrave had newly bought of Mr.Daun for L250; one of the
best paintings I ever saw.Lord Capel, Sir Cyril Wyche, and Mr.Duncomb, made
Lord Justices in Ireland; Lord Sydney recalled, and made Master of the
Ordnance.Very lovely harvest weather, and a wholesome season,
but no garden fruit.Lord Nottingham resigned as Secretary of State; the
Commissioners of the Admiralty ousted, and Russell restored to his
office.The season continued very wet, as it had nearly all the summer,
if one might call it summer, in which there was no fruit, but corn was
very plentiful.In the lottery set up after the Venetian manner by
Mr.Neale, Sir R. Haddock, one of the Commissioners of the Navy, had the
greatest lot, L3,000; my coachman L40.Was the funeral of Captain Young, who died of the
stone and great age.I think he was the first who in the first war with
Cromwell against Spain, took the Governor of Havanna, and another rich
prize, and struck the first stroke against the Dutch fleet in the first
war with Holland in the time of the Rebellion; a sober man and an
excellent seaman.Much importuned to take the office of President of
the Royal Society, but I again declined it.We all dined at Pontac's as usual.Bentley preached at the Tabernacle, near Golden
Square.I gave my voice for him to proceed on his former subject the
following year in Mr.Boyle's lecture, in which he had been interrupted
by the importunity of Sir J. Rotheram that the Bishop of Chichester[80]
might be chosen the year before, to the great dissatisfaction of the
Bishop of Lincoln and myself.The Duchess of
Grafton's appeal to the House of Lords for the Prothonotary's place
given to the late Duke and to her son by King Charles II., now
challenged by the Lord Chief Justice.The judges were severely reproved
on something they said.[Footnote 80: A mistake for Bath and Wells.Bishop Kidder is
    referred to.]Prince Lewis of Baden came to London, and was much
feasted.Danish ships arrested carrying corn and naval stores to France.Dryden, the poet, who now intended to write no more plays, being intent
on his translation of Virgil.He read to us his prologue and epilogue to
his valedictory play now shortly to be acted.Lord Macclesfield, Lord Warrington, and Lord
Westmorland, all died within about one week.Several persons shot,
hanged, and made away with themselves.Now was the great trial of the appeal of Lord Bath
and Lord Montagu before the Lords, for the estate of the late Duke of
Albemarle.Stringfellow preached at Trinity parish, being
restored to that place, after the contest between the Queen and the
Bishop of London who had displaced him.Came the dismal news of the disaster befallen our
Turkey fleet by tempest, to the almost utter ruin of that trade, the
convoy of three or four men-of-war, and divers merchant ships, with all
their men and lading, having perished.[Sidenote: LONDON]

25th March, 1694.Martin's, preached; he was
likewise put in by the Queen, on the issue of her process with the
Bishop of London.I went to the Duke of Norfolk, to desire him to make
cousin Evelyn of Nutfield one of the Deputy-Lieutenants of Surrey, and
entreat him to dismiss my brother, now unable to serve by reason of age
and infirmity.The Duke granted the one, but would not suffer my brother
to resign his commission, desiring he should keep the honor of it during
his life, though he could not act.He professed great kindness to our
family.Sharp, Archbishop of York, preached in the
afternoon at the Tabernacle, by Soho.Bentley, our Boyle Lecturer, Chaplain to the
Bishop of Worcester, came to see me.A fiery exhalation rising out of the sea, spread itself
in Montgomeryshire a furlong broad, and many miles in length, burning
all straw, hay, thatch, and grass, but doing no harm to trees, timber,
or any solid things, only firing barns, or thatched houses.It left such
a taint on the grass as to kill all the cattle that eat of it.I saw the
attestations in the hands of the sufferers."The
Berkeley Castle" sunk by the French coming from the East Indies, worth
L200,000.The French took our castle of Gamboo in Guinea, so that the
Africa Actions fell to L30, and the India to L80.Some regiments of
Highland Dragoons were on their march through England; they were of
large stature, well appointed and disciplined.One of them having
reproached a Dutchman for cowardice in our late fight, was attacked by
two Dutchmen, when with his sword he struck off the head of one, and
cleft the skull of the other down to his chin.A very young gentleman named Wilson, the younger son of one who had not
above L200 a year estate, lived in the garb and equipage of the richest
nobleman, for house, furniture, coaches, saddle horses, and kept a
table, and all things accordingly, redeemed his father's estate, and
gave portions to his sisters, being challenged by one Laws, a Scotchman,
was killed in a duel, not fairly.The quarrel arose from his taking away
his own sister from lodging in a house where this Laws had a mistress,
which the mistress of the house thinking a disparagement to it, and
losing by it, instigated Laws to this duel.The mystery is how this so young a gentleman, very sober and
of good fame, could live in such an expensive manner; it could not be
discovered by all possible industry, or entreaty of his friends to make
him reveal it.It did not appear that he was kept by women, play,
coining, padding, or dealing in chemistry; but he would sometimes say
that if he should live ever so long, he had wherewith to maintain
himself in the same manner.He was very civil and well-natured, but of
no great force of understanding.Waller, an extraordinary young
gentleman of great accomplishments, skilled in mathematics, anatomy,
music, painting both in oil and miniature to great perfection, an
excellent botanist, a rare engraver on brass, writer in Latin, and a
poet; and with all this exceedingly modest.His house is an academy of
itself.I carried him to see Brompton Park [by Knightsbridge], where he
was in admiration at the store of rare plants, and the method he found
in that noble nursery, and how well it was cultivated.A public Bank of
L140,000, set up by Act of Parliament among other Acts, and Lotteries
for money to carry on the war.A
great rising of people in Buckinghamshire, on the declaration of a
famous preacher, till now reputed a sober and religious man, that our
Lord Christ appearing to him on the 16th of this month, told him he was
now come down, and would appear publicly at Pentecost, and gather all
the saints, Jews and Gentiles, and lead them to Jerusalem, and begin the
Millennium, and destroying and judging the wicked, deliver the
government of the world to the saints.Great multitudes followed this
preacher, divers of the most zealous brought their goods and
considerable sums of money, and began to live in imitation of the
primitive saints, minding no private concerns, continually dancing and
singing Hallelujah night and day.This brings to mind what I lately
happened to find in Alstedius, that the thousand years should begin this
very year 1694; it is in his "Encyclopaedia Biblica."My copy of the book
printed near sixty years ago.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

4th May, 1694.I went this day with my wife and four servants from Sayes
Court, removing much furniture of all sorts, books, pictures, hangings,
bedding, etc., to furnish the apartment my brother assigned me, and now,
after more than forty years, to spend the rest of my days with him at
Wotton, where I was born; leaving my house at Deptford full furnished,
and three servants, to my son-in-law Draper, to pass the summer in, and
such longer time as he should think fit to make use of it.This being the first Sunday in the month, the blessed
sacrament of the Lord's Supper ought to have been celebrated at Wotton
church, but in this parish it is exceedingly neglected, so that, unless
at the four great feasts, there is no communion hereabouts; which is a
great fault both in ministers and people.I have spoken to my brother,
who is the patron, to discourse the minister about it.Scarcely one
shower has fallen since the beginning of April.This week we had news of my Lord Tiviot having cut his
own throat, through what discontent not yet said.He had been, not many
years past, my colleague in the commission of the Privy Seal, in old
acquaintance, very soberly and religiously inclined.Lord, what are we
without thy continual grace!Lord Falkland, grandson to the learned Lord Falkland, Secretary of State
to King Charles I., and slain in his service, died now of the smallpox.He was a pretty, brisk, understanding, industrious young gentleman; had
formerly been faulty, but now much reclaimed; had also the good luck to
marry a very great fortune, besides being entitled to a vast sum, his
share of the Spanish wreck, taken up at the expense of divers
adventurers.From a Scotch Viscount he was made an English Baron,
designed Ambassador for Holland; had been Treasurer of the Navy, and
advancing extremely in the new Court.All now gone in a moment, and I
think the title is extinct.I know not whether the estate devolves to my
cousin Carew.It was at my Lord Falkland's, whose lady importuned us to
let our daughter be with her some time, so that that dear child took the
same infection, which cost her valuable life.Edwards, minister of Denton, in Sussex, a living in
my brother's gift, came to see him.Wotton, that extraordinary learned
young man, preached excellently.Duncomb, minister of Albury, preached at Wotton, a
very religious and exact discourse.The first great bank for a fund of money being now established by Act of
Parliament, was filled and completed to the sum of L120,000, and put
under the government of the most able and wealthy citizens of London.All who adventured any sum had four per cent., so long as it lay in the
bank, and had power either to take it out at pleasure, or transfer it.Glorious steady weather; corn and all fruits in extraordinary plenty
generally.Lord Berkeley burnt Dieppe and Havre de Grace with
bombs, in revenge for the defeat at Brest.This manner of destructive
war was begun by the French, is exceedingly ruinous, especially falling
on the poorer people, and does not seem to tend to make a more speedy
end of the war; but rather to exasperate and incite to revenge.Many
executed at London for clipping money, now done to that intolerable
extent, that there was hardly any money that was worth above half the
nominal value.I went to visit my cousin, George Evelyn of Nutfield,
where I found a family of ten children, five sons and five
daughters--all beautiful women grown, and extremely well-fashioned.All
painted in one piece, very well, by Mr.Lutterell, in crayon on copper,
and seeming to be as finely painted as the best miniature.They are the
children of two extraordinary beautiful wives.Stormy and unseasonable wet weather this week.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th October, 1694.Paul's to see the choir, now finished
as to the stone work, and the scaffold struck both without and within,
in that part.Some exceptions might perhaps be taken as to the placing
columns on pilasters at the east tribunal.As to the rest it is a piece
of architecture without reproach.The pulling out the forms, like
drawers, from under the stalls, is ingenious.I went also to see the
building beginning near St.Giles's, where seven streets make a star
from a Doric pillar placed in the middle of a circular area; said to be
built by Mr.Neale, introducer of the late lotteries, in imitation of
those at Venice, now set up here, for himself twice, and now one for the
State.Visited the Bishop of Lincoln [Tenison] newly come
on the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who a few days before had
a paralytic stroke,--the same day and month that Archbishop Sancroft was
put out.A very sickly time, especially the smallpox, of which divers
considerable persons died.The State lottery[81] drawing, Mr.Cock, a
French refugee, and a President in the Parliament of Paris for the
Reformed, drew a lot of L1,000 per annum.[Footnote 81: State lotteries finally closed October 18, 1826.]I visited the Marquis of Normanby, and had much
discourse concerning King Charles II.Also concerning
the _quinquina_ which the physicians would not give to the King, at a
time when, in a dangerous ague, it was the only thing that could cure
him (out of envy because it had been brought into vogue by Mr.Tudor, an
apothecary), till Dr.Short, to whom the King sent to know his opinion
of it privately, he being reputed a <DW7> (but who was in truth a very
honest, good Christian), sent word to the King that it was the only
thing which could save his life, and then the King enjoined his
physicians to give it to him, which they did and he recovered.Being
asked by this Lord why they would not prescribe it, Dr.Lower said it
would spoil their practice, or some such expression, and at last
confessed it was a remedy fit only for kings.Exception was taken that
the late Archbishop did not cause any of his Chaplains to use any office
for the sick during his illness.I had news that my dear and worthy friend, Dr.Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln, was made Archbishop of Canterbury, for which
I thank God and rejoice, he being most worthy of it, for his learning,
piety, and prudence.He being my
proxy, gave my vote for Dr.The smallpox increased exceedingly, and was very
mortal.The Queen died of it on the 28th.The deaths by
smallpox increased to five hundred more than in the preceding week.The
King and Princess Anne reconciled, and she was invited to keep her Court
at Whitehall, having hitherto lived privately at Berkeley House; she was
desired to take into her family divers servants of the late Queen; to
maintain them the King has assigned her L5,000 a quarter.The frost and continual snow have now lasted five
weeks.Lord Spencer married the Duke of Newcastle's daughter,
and our neighbor, Mr.Hussey, married a daughter of my cousin, George
Evelyn, of Nutfield.The long frost intermitted, but not gone.Called to London by Lord Godolphin, one of the
Lords of the Treasury, offering me the treasurership of the hospital
designed to be built at Greenwich for worn-out seamen.The Marquis of Normanby told me King Charles had a
design to buy all King Street, and build it nobly, it being the street
leading to Westminster.This might have been done for the expense of the
Queen's funeral, which was L50,000, against her desire.Never was so universal a
mourning; all the Parliament men had cloaks given them, and four hundred
poor women; all the streets hung and the middle of the street boarded
and covered with black cloth.There were all the nobility, mayor,
aldermen, judges, etc.I supped at the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry's,
who related to me the pious behavior of the Queen in all her sickness,
which was admirable.She never inquired of what opinion persons were,
who were objects of charity; that, on opening a cabinet, a paper was
found wherein she had desired that her body might not be opened, or any
extraordinary expense at her funeral, whenever she should die.This
paper was not found in time to be observed.There were other excellent
things under her own hand, to the very least of her debts, which were
very small, and everything in that exact method, as seldom is found in
any private person.In sum, she was such an admirable woman, abating for
taking the Crown without a more due apology, as does, if possible, outdo
the renowned Queen Elizabeth.I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's with Lord Spencer.My Lord showed me his library, now again improved by many books bought
at the sale of Sir Charles Scarborough, an eminent physician, which was
the very best collection, especially of mathematical books, that was I
believe in Europe, once designed for the King's Library at St.James's;
but the Queen dying, who was the great patroness of that design, it was
let fall, and the books were miserably dissipated.The new edition of Camden's "Britannia" was now published (by Bishop
Gibson), with great additions; those to Surrey were mine, so that I had
one presented to me.of some parts of the New
Testament in vulgar Latin, that had belonged to a monastery in the North
of Scotland, which he esteemed to be about eight hundred years old;
there were some considerable various readings observable, as in John i.,
and genealogy of St.Duncomb, parson of this parish,
preached, which he hardly comes to above once a year though but seven or
eight miles off; a florid discourse, read out of his notes.The Holy
Sacrament followed, which he administered with very little reverence,
leaving out many prayers and exhortations; nor was there any oblation.This ought to be reformed, but my good brother did not well consider
when he gave away this living and the next [Abinger].The latter end of the month sharp and severely cold, with
much snow and hard frost; no appearance of spring.Lucas preached in the afternoon at Wotton.[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th April, 1695.Lord Halifax died suddenly at London, the day his
daughter was married to the Earl of Nottingham's son at Burleigh.Lord
H. was a very rich man, very witty, and in his younger days somewhat
positive.After a most severe, cold, and snowy winter, without
almost any shower for many months, the wind continuing N. and E. and not
a leaf appearing; the weather and wind now changed, some showers fell,
and there was a remission of cold.The spring begins to appear, yet the trees hardly
leafed.Sir T. Cooke discovers what prodigious bribes have been given by
some of the East India Company out of the stock, which makes a great
clamor.Never were so many private bills passed for unsettling estates,
showing the wonderful prodigality and decay of families.I came to Deptford from Wotton, in order to the first
meeting of the Commissioners for endowing an hospital for seamen at
Greenwich; it was at the Guildhall, London.Present, the Archbishop of
Canterbury, Lord Keeper, Lord Privy Seal, Lord Godolphin, Duke of
Shrewsbury, Duke of Leeds, Earls of Dorset and Monmouth, Commissioners
of the Admiralty and Navy, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir Christopher Wren, and
several more.Lowndes, Secretary to the
Lords of the Treasury, Surveyor-General.Second meeting of the Commissioners, and a committee
appointed to go to Greenwich to survey the place, I being one of them.We went to survey Greenwich, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir
Christopher Wren, Mr.Travers, the King's Surveyor, Captain Sanders, and
myself.We made report of the state of Greenwich house, and how
the standing part might be made serviceable at present for L6,000, and
what ground would be requisite for the whole design.My Lord Keeper
ordered me to prepare a book for subscriptions, and a preamble to it.Vanbrugh was made secretary to the
commission, by my nomination of him to the Lords, which was all done
that day.The commissioners met at Guildhall, when there were
scruples and contests of the Lord Mayor, who would not meet, not being
named as one of the quorum, so that a new commission was required,
though the Lord Keeper and the rest thought it too nice a punctilio.Met at Guildhall, but could do nothing for want of a
quorum.At Guildhall; account of subscriptions, about L7,000 or
L8,000.I dined at Lambeth, making my first visit to the
Archbishop, where there was much company, and great cheer.After prayers
in the evening, my Lord made me stay to show me his house, furniture,
and garden, which were all very fine, and far beyond the usual
Archbishops, not as affected by this, but being bought ready furnished
by his predecessor.We discoursed of several public matters,
particularly of the Princess of Denmark, who made so little figure.Met at Guildhall; not a full committee, so nothing
done.No sermon at church; but, after prayers, the names of
all the parishioners were read, in order to gathering the tax of 4s.for
marriages, burials, etc.A very imprudent tax, especially this reading
the names, so that most went out of the church.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

19th July, 1695.I dined at Sir Purbeck Temple's, near Croydon; his lady
is aunt to my son-in-law, Draper; the house exactly furnished.Went
thence with my son and daughter to Wotton.Duncomb,
parson of Albury, preached excellently.The weather now so cold, that greater frosts were not
always seen in the midst of winter; this succeeded much wet, and set
harvest extremely back.Offley preached at Abinger; too much
controversy on a point of no consequence, for the country people here.This was the first time I had heard him preach.Bombarding of Cadiz; a
cruel and brutish way of making war, first began by the French.The
season wet, great storms, unseasonable harvest weather.My good and
worthy friend, Captain Gifford, who that he might get some competence to
live decently, adventured all he had in a voyage of two years to the
East Indies, was, with another great ship, taken by some French
men-of-war, almost within sight of England, to the loss of near L70,000,
to my great sorrow, and pity of his wife, he being also a valiant and
industrious man.The losses of this sort to the nation have been
immense, and all through negligence, and little care to secure the same
near our own coasts; of infinitely more concern to the public than
spending their time in bombarding and ruining two or three paltry towns,
without any benefit, or weakening our enemies, who, though they began,
ought not to be imitated in an action totally averse to humanity, or
Christianity.Sir Purbeck Temple, uncle to my
son Draper, died suddenly.His lady being
own aunt to my son Draper, he hopes for a good fortune, there being no
heir.There had been a new meeting of the commissioners about Greenwich
hospital, on the new commission, where the Lord Mayor, etc.appeared,
but I was prevented by indisposition from attending.The weather very
sharp, winter approaching apace.The King went a progress into the
north, to show himself to the people against the elections, and was
everywhere complimented, except at Oxford, where it was not as he
expected, so that he hardly stopped an hour there, and having seen the
theater, did not receive the banquet proposed.Paul's school, who showed me many curious passages out of some
ancient Platonists' MSS.concerning the Trinity, which this great and
learned person would publish, with many other rare things, if he was
encouraged, and eased of the burden of teaching.The Archbishop and myself went to Hammersmith, to
visit Sir Samuel Morland, who was entirely blind; a very mortifying
sight.He showed us his invention of writing, which was very ingenious;
also his wooden calendar, which instructed him all by feeling; and other
pretty and useful inventions of mills, pumps, etc., and the pump he had
erected that serves water to his garden, and to passengers, with an
inscription, and brings from a filthy part of the Thames near it a most
perfect and pure water.He had newly buried L200 worth of music books
six feet under ground, being, as he said, love songs and vanity.He
plays himself psalms and religious hymns on the theorbo.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th November, 1695.Stanhope, Vicar of Lewisham, preached at
Whitehall.He is one of the most accomplished preachers I ever heard,
for matter, eloquence, action, voice, and I am told, of excellent
conversation.Famous fireworks and very chargeable, the King
being returned from his progress.He stayed seven or eight days at Lord
Sunderland's at Althorpe, where he was mightily entertained.These
fireworks were shown before Lord Romney, master of the ordnance, in St.James's great square, where the King stood.I spoke to the Archbishop of Canterbury to interest
himself for restoring a room belonging to St.James's library, where the
books want place.Williams continued in Boyle's
lectures another year.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, now the great favorite
and underhand politician, but not adventuring on any character, being
obnoxious to the people for having twice changed his religion.The Parliament wondrously intent on ways to reform
the coin; setting out a Proclamation prohibiting the currency of
half-crowns, etc., which made much confusion among the people.Hitherto mild, dark, misty, weather.Great confusion and distraction by reason of the
clipped money, and the difficulty found in reforming it.An extraordinary wet season, though temperate as to
cold.The "Royal Sovereign" man-of-war burned at Chatham.It was built
in 1637, and having given occasion to the levy of ship money was perhaps
the cause of all the after troubles to this day.An earthquake in
Dorsetshire by Portland, or rather a sinking of the ground suddenly for
a large space, near the quarries of stone, hindering the conveyance of
that material for the finishing St.There was now a conspiracy of about thirty
knights, gentlemen, captains, many of them Irish and English <DW7>s,
and Nonjurors or Jacobites (so called), to murder King William on the
first opportunity of his going either from Kensington, or to hunting, or
to the chapel; and upon signal of fire to be given from Dover Cliff to
Calais, an invasion was designed.In order to it there was a great army
in readiness, men-of-war and transports, to join a general insurrection
here, the Duke of Berwick having secretly come to London to head them,
King James attending at Calais with the French army.It was discovered
by some of their own party.L1,000 reward was offered to whoever could
apprehend any of the thirty named.Most of those who were engaged in it,
were taken and secured.The Parliament, city, and all the nation,
congratulate the discovery; and votes and resolutions were passed that,
if King William should ever be assassinated, it should be revenged on
the <DW7>s and party through the nation; an Act of Association drawing
up to empower the Parliament to sit on any such accident, till the Crown
should be disposed of according to the late settlement at the
Revolution.All <DW7>s, in the meantime, to be banished ten miles from
London.This put the nation into an incredible disturbance and general
animosity against the French King and King James.The militia of the
nation was raised, several regiments were sent for out of Flanders, and
all things put in a posture to encounter a descent.This was so timed by
the enemy, that while we were already much discontented by the greatness
of the taxes, and corruption of the money, etc., we had like to have had
very few men-of-war near our coasts; but so it pleased God that Admiral
Rooke wanting a wind to pursue his voyage to the Straits, that squadron,
with others at Portsmouth and other places, were still in the Channel,
and were soon brought up to join with the rest of the ships which could
be got together, so that there is hope this plot may be broken.I look
on it as a very great deliverance and prevention by the providence of
God.Though many did formerly pity King James's condition, this design
of assassination and bringing over a French army, alienated many oL his
friends, and was likely to produce a more perfect establishment of King
William.The wind continuing N. and E. all this week, brought so
many of our men-of-war together that, though most of the French finding
their design detected and prevented, made a shift to get into Calais and
Dunkirk roads, we wanting fire-ships and bombs to disturb them; yet they
were so engaged among the sands and flats, that 'tis said they cut their
masts and flung their great guns overboard to lighten their vessels.French were to
have invaded at once England, Scotland, and Ireland.Divers of the conspirators tried and condemned.Vesuvius breaking out, terrified Naples.Three of the unhappy wretches,
whereof one was a priest, were executed[82] for intending to assassinate
the King; they acknowledged their intention, but acquitted King James of
inciting them to it, and died very penitent.Divers more in danger, and
some very considerable persons.[Footnote 82: Robert Charnock, Edward King, and Thomas Keys.][Sidenote: LONDON]

6th April, 1696.The quarters of Sir William Perkins and Sir John
Friend, lately executed on the plot, with Perkins's head, were set up at
Temple Bar, a dismal sight, which many pitied.I think there never was
such at Temple Bar till now, except once in the time of King Charles
II., namely, of Sir Thomas Armstrong.[83]

    [Footnote 83: He was concerned in the Rye-House plot, fled into
    Holland, was given up, and executed in his own country, 1684.Great offense taken at the three ministers who
absolved Sir William Perkins and Friend at Tyburn.One of them (Snatt)
was a son of my old schoolmaster.This produced much altercation as to
the canonicalness of the action.We had a meeting at Guildhall of the grand committee
about settling the draught of Greenwich hospital.I went to Eton, and dined with Dr.The schoolmaster assured me there had not been for twenty years
a more pregnant youth in that place than my grandson.I went to see the
King's House at Kensington.The
gallery furnished with the best pictures [from] all the houses, of
Titian, Raphael, Correggio, Holbein, Julio Romano, Bassan, Vandyke,
Tintoretto, and others; a great collection of porcelain; and a pretty
private library.His prayer before
the sermon was one of the most excellent compositions I ever heard.The Venetian Ambassador made a stately entry with
fifty footmen, many on horseback, four rich coaches, and a numerous
train of gallants.Oates
dedicated a most villainous, reviling book against King James, which he
presumed to present to King William, who could not but abhor it,
speaking so infamously and untruly of his late beloved Queen's own
father.I dined at Lambeth, being summoned to meet my co-trustees,
the Archbishop, Sir Henry Ashurst, and Mr.Serjeant Rotheram, to consult
about settling Mr.Boyle's lecture for a perpetuity; which we concluded
upon, by buying a rent charge of L50 per annum, with the stock in our
hands.I went to Lambeth, to meet at dinner the Countess of
Sunderland and divers ladies.We dined in the Archbishop's wife's
apartment with his Grace, and stayed late; yet I returned to Deptford at
night.I went to London to meet my son, newly come from
Ireland, indisposed.Money still continuing exceedingly scarce, so that
none was paid or received, but all was on trust, the mint not supplying
for common necessities.The Association with an oath required of all
lawyers and officers, on pain of _praemunire_, whereby men were obliged
to renounce King James as no rightful king, and to revenge King
William's death, if happening by assassination.This to be taken by all
the Counsel by a day limited, so that the Courts of Chancery and King's
Bench hardly heard any cause in Easter Term, so many crowded to take the
oath.This was censured as a very entangling contrivance of the
Parliament in expectation, that many in high office would lay down, and
others surrender.Many gentlemen taken up on suspicion of the late plot,
were now discharged out of prison.We settled divers offices, and other matters relating to
workmen, for the beginning of Greenwich hospital.[Sidenote: DEPTFORD]

1st June, 1696.I went to Deptford to dispose of our goods, in order to
letting the house for three years to Vice Admiral Benbow, with condition
to keep up the garden.A committee met at Whitehall about Greenwich Hospital,
at Sir Christopher Wren's, his Majesty's Surveyor-General.We made the
first agreement with divers workmen and for materials; and gave the
first order for proceeding on the foundation, and for weekly payments to
the workmen, and a general account to be monthly.Dined at Lord Pembroke's, Lord Privy Seal, a very
worthy gentleman.He showed me divers rare pictures of very many of the
old and best masters, especially one of M. Angelo of a man gathering
fruit to give to a woman, and a large book of the best drawings of the
old masters.Sir John Fenwick, one of the conspirators, was taken.Great
subscriptions in Scotland to their East India Company.Want of current
money to carry on the smallest concerns, even for daily provisions in
the markets.Guineas lowered to twenty-two shillings, and great sums
daily transported to Holland, where it yields more, with other treasure
sent to pay the armies, and nothing considerable coined of the new and
now only current stamp, cause such a scarcity that tumults are every day
feared, nobody paying or receiving money; so imprudent was the late
Parliament to condemn the old though clipped and corrupted, till they
had provided supplies.To this add the fraud of the bankers and
goldsmiths, who having gotten immense riches by extortion, keep up their
treasure in expectation of enhancing its value.Duncombe, not long since
a mean goldsmith, having made a purchase of the late Duke of
Buckingham's estate at nearly L90,000, and reputed to have nearly as
much in cash.Banks and lotteries every day set up.The famous trial between my Lord Bath and Lord Montague
for an estate of L11,000 a year, left by the Duke of Albemarle, wherein
on several trials had been spent,L20,000 between them.The Earl of Bath
was cast on evident forgery.I made my Lord Cheney a visit at Chelsea, and saw those
ingenious waterworks invented by Mr.Winstanley, wherein were some
things very surprising and extraordinary.An exceedingly rainy, cold, unseasonable summer, yet
the city was very healthy.A trial in the Common Pleas between the Lady Purbeck
Temple and Mr.Temple, a nephew of Sir Purbeck, concerning a deed set up
to take place of several wills.The
cause went on my lady's side.This concerning my son-in-law, Draper, I
stayed almost all day at Court.A great supper was given to the jury,
being persons of the best condition in Buckinghamshire.I went with a select committee of the Commissioners for
Greenwich Hospital, and with Sir Christopher Wren, where with him I laid
the first stone of the intended foundation, precisely at five o'clock in
the evening, after we had dined together.Flamstead, the King's
Astronomical Professor, observing the punctual time by instruments.Note that my Lord Godolphin was the first of the
subscribers who paid any money to this noble fabric.A northern wind altering the weather with a continual
and impetuous rain of three days and nights changed it into perfect
winter.So little money in the nation that Exchequer Tallies,
of which I had for L2,000 on the best fund in England, the Post Office,
nobody would take at 30 per cent discount.The Bank lending the L200,000 to pay the array in
Flanders, that had done nothing against the enemy, had so exhausted the
treasure of the nation, that one could not have borrowed money under 14
or 15 per cent on bills, or on Exchequer Tallies under 30 per cent.I went to Lambeth and dined with the
Archbishop, who had been at Court on the complaint against Dr.David's, who was suspended for simony.The
Archbishop told me how unsatisfied he was with the Canon law, and how
exceedingly unreasonable all their pleadings appeared to him.Fine seasonable weather, and a great harvest after a
cold, wet summer.I went to congratulate the marriage of a daughter
of Mr.Boscawen to the son of Sir Philip Meadows; she is niece to my
Lord Godolphin, married at Lambeth by the Archbishop, 30th of August.After above six months' stay in London about Greenwich Hospital, I
returned to Wotton.Unseasonable stormy weather, and an ill seedtime.Lord Godolphin retired from the Treasury, who was the
first Commissioner and most skillful manager of all.The first frost began fiercely, but lasted not long.15th-23d November, 1696.Very stormy weather, rain, and inundations.The severe frost and weather relented, but again
froze with snow.Sir John
Fenwick was beheaded.Soldiers in the
armies and garrison towns frozen to death on their posts.I came to Wotton after three months' absence.Very bright weather, but with sharp east wind.My son
came from London in his melancholy indisposition.Duncombe, the rector, came and preached after
an absence of two years, though only living seven or eight miles off [at
Ashted].So great were the storms all this week, that near a
thousand people were lost going into the Texel.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th November, 1697.The King's entry very pompous; but is nothing
approaching that of King Charles II.Thanksgiving Day for the Peace, the King and a great
Court at Whitehall.The Bishop of Salisbury preached, or rather made a
florid panegyric, on 2 Chron.The evening concluded with
fireworks and illuminations of great expense.Paul's had had service
performed in it since it was burned in 1666.I went to Kensington with the Sheriff, Knights, and
chief gentlemen of Surrey, to present their address to the King.The
Duke of Norfolk promised to introduce it, but came so late, that it was
presented before be came.This insignificant ceremony was brought in in
Cromwell's time, and has ever since continued with offers of life and
fortune to whoever happened to have the power.I dined at Sir Richard
Onslow's, who treated almost all the gentlemen of Surrey.When we had
half dined, the Duke of Norfolk came in to make his excuse.At the Temple Church; it was very long before the
service began, staying for the Comptroller of the Inner Temple, where
was to be kept a riotous and reveling Christmas, according to custom.Bentley, about the Library at
St.A great Christmas kept at Wotton, open house, much company.I
presented my book of Medals, etc., to divers noblemen, before I exposed
it to sale.Fulham, who lately married my niece, preached
against atheism, a very eloquent discourse, somewhat improper for most
of the audience at [Wotton], but fitted for some other place, and very
apposite to the profane temper of the age.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th January, 1698.Whitehall burned, nothing but walls and ruins left.The imprisonment of the great banker, Duncombe:
censured by Parliament; acquitted by the Lords; sent again to the Tower
by the Commons.The Czar of Muscovy being come to England, and having a mind to see the
building of ships, hired my house at Sayes Court, and made it his court
and palace, newly furnished for him by the King.[84]

    [Footnote 84: While the Czar was in his house.Evelyn's servant
    writes to him: "There is a house full of people, and right nasty.The Czar lies next your library, and dines in the parlor next your
    study.He dines at ten o'clock and at six at night; is very seldom
    at home a whole day; very often in the King's yard, or by water,
    dressed in several dresses.The King is expected here this day; the
    best parlor is pretty clean for him to be entertained in.The King
    pays for all he has."]The Czar went from my house to return home.An
exceedingly sharp and cold season.An extraordinary great snow and frost, nipping the corn
and other fruits.Corn at nine shillings a bushel [L18 a load].Pepys's, where I heard the rare voice of
Mr.Pule, who was lately come from Italy, reputed the most excellent
singer we had ever had.White, late Bishop of Norwich, who had been ejected
for not complying with Government, was buried in St.Gregory's
churchyard, or vault, at St.His hearse was accompanied by two
non-juror bishops, Dr.Lloyd, with forty other
non-juror clergymen, who would not stay the Office of the burial,
because the Dean of St.Paul's had appointed a conforming minister to
read the Office; at which all much wondered, there being nothing in that
Office which mentioned the present King.Godolphin
with the Earl of Marlborough's daughter.To Deptford, to see how miserably the Czar had left my
house, after three months making it his Court.I got Sir Christopher
Wren, the King's surveyor, and Mr.London, his gardener, to go and
estimate the repairs, for which they allowed L150 in their report to the
Lords of the Treasury.I then went to see the foundation of the Hall and
Chapel at Greenwich Hospital.I dined with Pepys, where was Captain Dampier,[85] who
had been a famous buccaneer, had brought hither the painted Prince Job,
and printed a relation of his very strange adventure, and his
observations.He was now going abroad again by the King's encouragement,
who furnished a ship of 290 tons.He seemed a more modest man than one
would imagine by the relation of the crew he had assorted with.He
brought a map of his observations of the course of the winds in the
South Sea, and assured us that the maps hitherto extant were all false
as to the Pacific Sea, which he makes on the south of the line, that on
the north end running by the coast of Peru being extremely tempestuous.[Footnote 85: The celebrated navigator, born in 1652, the time of
    whose death is uncertain.His "Voyage Round the World" has gone
    through many editions, and the substance of it has been transferred
    to many collections of voyages.]Foy came to me to use my interest with Lord
Sunderland for his being made Professor of Physic at Oxford, in the
King's gift.I went also to the Archbishop in his behalf.Being one of the Council of the Royal Society, I was
named to be of the committee to wait on our new President, the Lord
Chancellor, our Secretary, Dr.Sloane, and Sir R. Southwell, last
Vice-President, carrying our book of statutes; the office of the
President being read, his Lordship subscribed his name, and took the
oaths according to our statutes as a Corporation for the improvement of
natural knowledge.Then his Lordship made a short compliment concerning
the honor the Society had done him, and how ready he would be to promote
so noble a design, and come himself among us, as often as the attendance
on the public would permit; and so we took our leave.She was daughter to Sir
John Evelyn, of Wilts, my father's nephew; she was widow to William
Pierrepoint, brother to the Marquis of Dorchester, and mother to Evelyn
Pierrepoint, Earl of Kingston; a most excellent and prudent lady.[Sidenote: LONDON]

The House of Commons persist in refusing more than 7,000 men to be a
standing army, and no strangers to be in the number.Our county member, Sir R. Onslow, opposed it also; which
might reconcile him to the people, who began to suspect him.Mander, the
Master of Baliol College, where he was entered a fellow-commoner.A most furious wind, such as has not happened for
many years, doing great damage to houses and trees, by the fall of which
several persons were killed.The old East India Company lost their business against
the new Company, by ten votes in Parliament, so many of their friends
being absent, going to see a tiger baited by dogs.The persecuted Vaudois, who were banished out of Savoy, were received by
the German Protestant Princes.My only remaining son died after a tedious languishing
sickness, contracted in Ireland, and increased here, to my exceeding
grief and affliction; leaving me one grandson, now at Oxford, whom I
pray God to prosper and be the support of the Wotton family.He was aged
forty-four years and about three months.He had been six years one of
the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland, with great ability and
reputation.After an extraordinary storm, there came up the Thames
a whale which was fifty-six feet long.Such, and a larger of the spout
kind, was killed there forty years ago (June 1658).My deceased son was buried in the vault at Wotton,
according to his desire.The Duke of Devon lost L1,900 at a horse race at Newmarket.The King preferring his young favorite Earl of Albemarle to be first
Commander of his Guard, the Duke of Ormond laid down his commission.This of the Dutch Lord passing over his head, was exceedingly resented
by everybody.Lord Spencer purchased an incomparable library[86] of...
wherein, among other rare books, were several that were printed at the
first invention of that wonderful art, as particularly "Tully's Offices,
etc."There was a Homer and a Suidas in a very good Greek character and
good paper, almost as ancient.This gentleman is a very fine scholar,
whom from a child I have known.[Footnote 86: The foundation of the noble library now at Blenheim.]I dined with the Archbishop; but my business was to
get him to persuade the King to purchase the late Bishop of Worcester's
library, and build a place for his own library at St.James's, in the
Park, the present one being too small.At a meeting of the Royal Society I was nominated to be of
the committee to wait on the Lord Chancellor to move the King to
purchase the Bishop of Worcester's library (Dr.The Court party have little influence in this Session.The Duke of Ormond restored to his commission.All
Lotteries, till now cheating the people, to be no longer permitted than
to Christmas, except that for the benefit of Greenwich Hospital.Bridgman, chairman of the committee for that charitable work, died; a
great loss to it.He was Clerk of the Council, a very industrious,
useful man.John Moore,[87] Bishop of Norwich,
one of the best and most ample collection of all sorts of good books in
England, and he, one of the most learned men.[Footnote 87: Afterward Bishop of Ely.He died 31st of July, 1714.King George I. purchased this library after the Bishop's death, for
    L6,000, and presented it to the University of Cambridge, where it
    now is.]After a long drought, we had a refreshing shower.The
day before, there was a dreadful fire at Rotherhithe, near the Thames
side, which burned divers ships, and consumed nearly three hundred
houses.Now died the famous Duchess of Mazarin; she had been the richest
lady in Europe.She was niece of Cardinal Mazarin, and was married to
the richest subject in Europe, as is said.She was born at Rome,
educated in France, and was an extraordinary beauty and wit but
dissolute and impatient of matrimonial restraint, so as to be abandoned
by her husband, and banished, when she came into England for shelter,
lived on a pension given her here, and is reported to have hastened her
death by intemperate drinking strong spirits.She has written her own
story and adventures, and so has her other extravagant sister, wife to
the noble family of Colonna.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th June, 1699.This week died Conyers Seymour, son of Sir Edward
Seymour, killed in a duel caused by a slight affront in St.James's
Park, given him by one who was envious of his gallantries; for he was a
vain, foppish young man, who made a great _eclat_ about town by his
splendid equipage and boundless expense.He was about twenty-three years
old; his brother, now at Oxford, inherited an estate of L7,000 a year,
which had fallen to him not two years before.My cousin, George Evelyn, of Nutfield, died suddenly.The heat has been so great, almost all this month, that
I do not remember to have felt much greater in Italy, and this after a
winter the wettest, though not the coldest, that I remember for fifty
years last past.Finding my occasions called me so often to London, I
took the remainder of the lease my son had in a house in Dover Street,
to which I now removed, not taking my goods from Wotton.Seasonable showers, after a continuance of excessive
drought and heat.At Deptford, they had
been building a pretty new church.David's [Watson]
deprived for simony.[88] The city of Moscow burnt by the throwing of
squibs.[Footnote 88: _Ante_, p.There was in this week an eclipse of the sun, at
which many were frightened by the predictions of the astrologers.I
remember fifty years ago that many were so terrified by Lilly, that they
dared not go out of their houses.A strange earthquake at New Batavia,
in the East Indies.My worthy brother died at Wotton, in the 83d year of
his age, of perfect memory and understanding.He was religious, sober,
and temperate, and of so hospitable a nature, that no family in the
county maintained that ancient custom of keeping, as it were, open house
the whole year in the same manner, or gave more noble or free
entertainment to the county on all occasions, so that his house was
never free.There were sometimes twenty persons more than his family,
and some that stayed there all the summer, to his no small expense; by
this he gained the universal love of the county.He was born at Wotton,
went from the free school at Guildford to Trinity College, Oxford,
thence to the Middle Temple, as gentlemen of the best quality did, but
without intention to study the law as a profession.He married the
daughter of Colwall, of a worthy and ancient family in Leicestershire,
by whom he had one son; she dying in 1643, left George her son an
infant, who being educated liberally, after traveling abroad, returned
and married one Mrs.Gore, by whom he had several children, but only
three daughters survived.He was a young man of good understanding, but,
over-indulging his ease and pleasure, grew so very corpulent, contrary
to the constitution of the rest of his father's relations, that he died.My brother afterward married a noble and honorable lady, relict of Sir
John Cotton, she being an Offley, a worthy and ancient Staffordshire
family, by whom he had several children of both sexes.This lady died,
leaving only two daughters and a son.The younger daughter died before
marriage; the other afterward married Sir Cyril Wych, a noble and
learned gentleman (son of Sir ---- Wych), who had been Ambassador at
Constantinople, and was afterward made one of the Lords Justices of
Ireland.Before this marriage, her only brother married the daughter of
---- Eversfield, of Sussex, of an honorable family, but left a widow
without any child living; he died about 1691, and his wife not many
years after, and my brother resettled the whole estate on me.His
sister, Wych, had a portion of L6,000, to which was added L300 more; the
three other daughters, with what I added, had about L5,000 each.My
brother died on the 5th of October, in a good old age and great
reputation, making his beloved daughter, Lady Wych, sole executrix,
leaving me only his library and some pictures of my father, mother, etc.She buried him with extraordinary solemnity, rather as a nobleman than
as a private gentleman.There were, as I computed, above 2,000 persons
at the funeral, all the gentlemen of the county doing him the last
honors.I returned to London, till my lady should dispose of herself and
family.After an unusual warm and pleasant season, we were
surprised with a very sharp frost.I presented my "_Acetaria_,"
dedicated to my Lord Chancellor, who returned me thanks in an
extraordinarily civil letter.There happened this week so thick a mist and fog,
that people lost their way in the streets, it being so intense that no
light of candles, or torches, yielded any (or but very little)
direction.Robberies were committed between
the very lights which were fixed between London and Kensington on both
sides, and while coaches and travelers were passing.It began about four
in the afternoon, and was quite gone by eight, without any wind to
disperse it.At the Thames, they beat drums to direct the watermen to
make the shore.At our chapel in the evening there was a sermon
preached by young Mr.Horneck, chaplain to Lord Guilford, whose lady's
funeral had been celebrated magnificently the Thursday before.A
panegyric was now pronounced, describing the extraordinary piety and
excellently employed life of this amiable young lady.She died in
childbed a few days before, to the excessive sorrow of her husband, who
ordered the preacher to declare that it was on her exemplary life,
exhortations and persuasion, that he totally changed the course of his
life, which was before in great danger of being perverted; following the
mode of this dissolute age.Her devotion, early piety, charity,
fastings, economy, disposition of her time in reading, praying,
recollections in her own handwriting of what she heard and read, and her
conversation were most exemplary.Blackwell's election to be the next
year's Boyles Lecturer.Such horrible robberies and murders were committed, as had not been
known in this nation; atheism, profaneness, blasphemy, among all sorts,
portended some judgment if not amended; on which a society was set on
foot, who obliged themselves to endeavor the reforming of it, in London
and other places, and began to punish offenders and put the laws in more
strict execution; which God Almighty prosper!A gentle, calm, dry,
temperate weather all this season of the year, but now came sharp, hard
frost, and mist, but calm.Calm, bright, and warm as in the middle of April.So
continued on 21st of January.[Sidenote: LONDON]

The Parliament reverses the prodigious donations of the Irish
forfeitures, which were intended to be set apart for discharging the
vast national debt.They called some great persons in the highest
offices in question for setting the Great Seal to the pardon of an
arch-pirate,[89] who had turned pirate again, and brought prizes into
the West Indies, suspected to be connived at on sharing the prey; but
the prevailing part in the House called Courtiers, out-voted the
complaints, not by being more in number, but by the country party being
negligent in attendance.[Footnote 89: Captain Kidd; he was hanged about two years afterward
    with some of his accomplices.This was one of the charges brought by
    the Commons against Lord Somers.]14th January, 1699-1700.Stringfellow, who had been made the first preacher at our chapel by
the Bishop of Lincoln [Dr.Tenison, now Archbishop], while he held St.Martin's by dispensation, and put in one Mr.Sandys, much against the
inclination of those who frequented the chapel.The Scotch book about
Darien was burned by the hangman by vote of Parliament.[90]

    [Footnote 90: The volume alluded to was "An Enquiry into the Causes
    of the Miscarriage of the Scots Colony at Darien: Or an Answer to a
    Libel," entitled "A Defense of the Scots abdicating Darien."See
    Votes of the House of Commons, 15th January, 1699-1700.]Died the Duke of Beaufort, a person of great honor,
prudence, and estate.I went to Wotton, the first time after my brother's
funeral, to furnish the house with necessaries, Lady Wych and my nephew
Glanville, the executors having sold and disposed of what goods were
there of my brother's.The weather was now altering into sharp and hard
frost.[Sidenote: LONDON]

One Stephens, who preached before the House of Commons on King Charles's
Martyrdom, told them that the observation of that day was not intended
out of any detestation of his murder, but to be a lesson to other Kings
and Rulers, how they ought to behave themselves toward their subjects,
lest they should come to the same end.This was so resented that, though
it was usual to desire these anniversary sermons to be printed, they
refused thanks to him, and ordered that in future no one should preach
before them, who was not either a Dean or a Doctor of Divinity.The Parliament voted against the Scots settling in
Darien as being prejudicial to our trade with Spain.They also voted
that the exorbitant number of attorneys be lessened (now indeed
swarming, and evidently causing lawsuits and disturbance, eating out the
estates of the people, provoking them to go to law).Mild and calm season, with gentle frost, and little
mizzling rain.Martin's frequently preached at Trinity
chapel in the afternoon.The season was like April for warmth and
mildness.--11th.On Wednesday, was a sermon at our chapel, to be
continued during Lent.I was at the funeral of my Lady Temple, who was buried
at Islington, brought from Addiscombe, near Croydon.She left my
son-in-law Draper (her nephew) the mansion house of Addiscombe, very
nobly and completely furnished, with the estate about it, with plate and
jewels, to the value in all of about L20,000.She was a very prudent
lady, gave many great legacies, with L500 to the poor of Islington,
where her husband, Sir Purbeck Temple, was buried, both dying without
issue.The season warm, gentle, and exceedingly pleasant.Divers persons of quality entered into the Society for Reformation[91]
of Manners; and some lectures were set up, particularly in the city of
London.The most eminent of the clergy preached at Bow Church, after
reading a declaration set forth by the King to suppress the growing
wickedness; this began already to take some effect as to common
swearing, and oaths in the mouths of people of all ranks.[Footnote 91: _Ante_, p.Burnet preached to-day before the Lord Mayor and a
very great congregation, on Proverbs xxvii.5, 6, "Open rebuke is better
than secret love; the wounds of a friend are better than the kisses of
an enemy."He made a very pathetic discourse concerning the necessity
and advantage of friendly correction.The Duke of Norfolk now succeeded in obtaining a divorce
from his wife by the Parliament for adultery with Sir John Germaine, a
Dutch gamester, of mean extraction, who had got much by gaming; the Duke
had leave to marry again, so that if he should have children, the
Dukedom will go from the late Lord Thomas's children, <DW7>s indeed,
but very hopeful and virtuous gentlemen, as was their father.The now
Duke their uncle is a Protestant.The Parliament nominated fourteen persons to go into Ireland as
commissioners to dispose of the forfeited estates there, toward payment
of the debts incurred by the late war, but which the King had in great
measure given to some of his favorites of both sexes, Dutch and others
of little merit, and very unseasonably.That this might be done without
suspicion of interest in the Parliament, it was ordered that no member
of either House should be in the commission.The great contest between
the Lords and Commons concerning the Lords' power of amendments and
rejecting bills tacked to the money bill, carried for the Commons.However, this tacking of bills is a novel practice, suffered by King
Charles II., who, being continually in want of money, let anything pass
rather than not have wherewith to feed his extravagance.This was
carried but by one voice in the Lords, all the Bishops following the
Court, save one; so that near sixty bills passed, to the great triumph
of the Commons and Country party, but high regret of the Court, and
those to whom the King had given large estates in Ireland.Pity it is,
that things should be brought to this extremity, the government of this
nation being so equally poised between King and subject; but we are
satisfied with nothing; and, while there is no perfection on this side
heaven, methinks both might be contented without straining things too
far.Among the rest, there passed a law as to <DW7>s' estates, that if
one turned not Protestant before eighteen years of age, it should pass
to his next Protestant heir.This indeed seemed a hard law, but not only
the usage of the French King to his Protestant subjects, but the
indiscreet insolence of the <DW7>s here, going in triumphant and public
processions with their Bishops, with banners and trumpets in divers
places (as is said) in the northern counties, has brought it on their
party.This week there was a great change of State officers.The Duke of Shrewsbury resigned his Lord Chamberlainship to the Earl of
Jersey, the Duke's indisposition requiring his retreat.Vernon,
Secretary of State, was put out.The Seal was taken from the Lord
Chancellor Somers, though he had been acquitted by a great majority of
votes for what was charged against him in the House of Commons.This
being in term time, put some stop to business, many eminent lawyers
refusing to accept the office, considering the uncertainty of things in
this fluctuating conjuncture.It is certain that this Chancellor was a
most excellent lawyer, very learned in all polite literature, a superior
pen, master of a handsome style, and of easy conversation; but he is
said to make too much haste to be rich, as his predecessor, and most in
place in this age did, to a more prodigious excess than was ever known.But the Commons had now so mortified the Court party, and property and
liberty were so much invaded in all the neighboring kingdoms, that their
jealousy made them cautious, and every day strengthened the law which
protected the people from tyranny.Mary journeyed to the bedroom.A most glorious spring, with hope of abundance of fruit of all kinds,
and a propitious year.The great trial between Sir Walter Clarges and Mr.Sherwin concerning the legitimacy of the late Duke of Albemarle, on
which depended an estate of L1,500 a year; the verdict was given for Sir
Walter, 19th.Serjeant Wright at last accepted the Great Seal.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

24th May, 1700.I went from Dover street to Wotton, for the rest of the
summer, and removed thither the rest of my goods from Sayes Court.A sweet season, with a mixture of refreshing showers.In the afternoon, our clergyman had a catechism,
which was continued for some time.I was visited with illness, but it pleased God that I
recovered, for which praise be ascribed to him by me, and that he has
again so graciously advertised me of my duty to prepare for my latter
end, which at my great age, cannot be far off.The Duke of Gloucester, son of the Princess Anne of Denmark, died of the
smallpox.I went to Harden, which was originally a barren warren
bought by Sir Robert Clayton, who built there a pretty house, and made
such alteration by planting not only an infinite store of the best
fruit; but so changed the natural situation of the hill, valleys, and
solitary mountains about it, that it rather represented some foreign
country, which would produce spontaneously pines, firs, cypress, yew,
holly, and juniper; they were come to their perfect growth, with walks,
mazes, etc., among them, and were preserved with the utmost care, so
that I who had seen it some years before in its naked and barren
condition, was in admiration of it.The land was bought of Sir John
Evelyn, of Godstone, and was thus improved for pleasure and retirement
by the vast charge and industry of this opulent citizen.He and his lady
received us with great civility.The tombs in the church at Croydon of
Archbishops Grindal, Whitgift, and other Archbishops, are fine and
venerable; but none comparable to that of the late Archbishop Sheldon,
which, being all of white marble, and of a stately ordinance and
carvings, far surpassed the rest, and I judge could not cost less than
L700 or L800.I went to Beddington, the ancient seat of the
Carews, in my remembrance a noble old structure, capacious, and in form
of the buildings of the age of Henry VIII.and Queen Elizabeth, and
proper for the old English hospitality, but now decaying with the house
itself, heretofore adorned with ample gardens, and the first orange
trees[92] that had been seen in England, planted in the open ground, and
secured in winter only by a tabernacle of boards and stoves removable in
summer, that, standing 120 years, large and goodly trees, and laden with
fruit, were now in decay, as well as the grotto, fountains, cabinets,
and other curiosities in the house and abroad, it being now fallen to a
child under age, and only kept by a servant or two from utter
dilapidation.The estate and park about it also in decay.[Footnote 92: Oranges were eaten in this kingdom much earlier than
    the time of King James I.]Pepys at Clapham, where he has
a very noble and wonderfully well-furnished house, especially with
Indian and Chinese curiosities.The offices and gardens well
accommodated for pleasure and retirement.My birthday now completed the 80th year of my age.I
with my soul render thanks to God, who, of his infinite mercy, not only
brought me out of many troubles, but this year restored me to health,
after an ague and other infirmities of so great an age; my sight,
hearing, and other senses and faculties tolerable, which I implore him
to continue, with the pardon of my sins past, and grace to acknowledge
by my improvement of his goodness the ensuing year, if it be his
pleasure to protract my life, that I may be the better prepared for my
last day, through the infinite merits of my blessed Savior, the Lord
Jesus, Amen!Came the news of my dear grandson (the only male of
my family now remaining) being fallen ill of the smallpox at Oxford,
which after the dire effects of it in my family exceedingly afflicted
me; but so it pleased my most merciful God that being let blood at his
first complaint, and by the extraordinary care of Dr.Mander (Head of
the college and now Vice Chancellor), who caused him to be brought and
lodged in his own bed and bedchamber, with the advice of his physician
and care of his tutor, there were all fair hopes of his recovery, to our
infinite comfort.We had a letter every day either from the Vice
Chancellor himself, or his tutor.Assurance of his recovery by a letter from himself.[Sidenote: LONDON]

There was a change of great officers at Court.Lord Godolphin returned
to his former station of first Commissioner of the Treasury; Sir Charles
Hedges, Secretary of State.At the Royal Society, Lord Somers, the late
Chancellor, was continued President.Great alterations of officers at Court, and
elsewhere,--Lord Chief Justice Treby died; he was a learned man in his
profession, of which we have now few, never fewer; the Chancery
requiring so little skill in deep law-learning, if the practicer can
talk eloquently in that Court; so that probably few care to study the
law to any purpose.Lord Marlborough Master of the Ordnance, in place of
Lord Romney made Groom of the Stole.The Earl of Rochester goes Lord
Lieutenant to Ireland.I finished the sale of North Stoake in Sussex to
Robert Michell, Esq., appointed by my brother to be sold for payment of
portions to my nieces, and other incumbrances on the estate.An exceeding deep snow, and melted away as suddenly.Severe frost, and such a tempest as threw down many
chimneys, and did great spoil at sea, and blew down above twenty trees
of mine at Wotton.Harley, an able
gentleman, chosen.Our countryman, Sir Richard Onslow, had a party for
him.By an order of the House of Commons, I laid before
the Speaker the state of what had been received and paid toward the
building of Greenwich Hospital.Wye, Rector of Wotton, died, a very worthy good man.Bohun, a learned person and excellent preacher, who had been my
son's tutor, and lived long in my family.I let Sayes Court to Lord Carmarthen, son to the Duke
of Leeds.I went to the funeral of my sister Draper, who was
buried at Edmonton in great state.Davenant displeased the clergy
now met in Convocation by a passage in his book, p.A Dutch boy of about eight or nine years old was carried
about by his parents to show, who had about the iris of one eye the
letters of _Deus meus_, and of the other _Elohim_, in the Hebrew
character.How this was done by artifice none could imagine; his parents
affirming that he was so born.It did not prejudice his sight, and he
seemed to be a lively playing boy.Everybody went to see him; physicians
and philosophers examined it with great accuracy; some considered it as
artificial, others as almost supernatural.The Duke of Norfolk died of an apoplexy, and Mr.Thomas
Howard of complicated disease since his being cut for the stone; he was
one of the Tellers of the Exchequer.Some Kentish men, delivering a petition to the House of
Commons, were imprisoned.[93]

    [Footnote 93: Justinian Champneys, Thomas Culpepper, William
    Culpepper, William Hamilton, and David Polhill, gentlemen of
    considerable property and family in the county.There is a very good
    print of them in five ovals on one plate, engraved by R. White, in
    1701.They desired the Parliament to mind the public more, and their
    private heats less.They were confined till the prorogation, and
    were much visited.A great dearth, no considerable rain having fallen for some months.Very plentiful showers, the wind coming west and south.The Bishops and Convocation at difference concerning the right of

20th June, 1701.The Commons demanded a conference with the Lords on the
trial of Lord Somers, which the Lords refused, and proceeding on the
trial, the Commons would not attend, and he was acquitted.I went to congratulate the arrival of that worthy and
excellent person my Lord Galway, newly come out of Ireland, where he had
behaved himself so honestly, and to the exceeding satisfaction of the
people: but he was removed thence for being a Frenchman, though they had
not a more worthy, valiant, discreet, and trusty person in the two
kingdoms, on whom they could have relied for his conduct and fitness.He
was one who had deeply suffered, as well as the Marquis, his father, for
being Protestants.My Lord Treasurer made my grandson one of the Commissioners
of the prizes, salary L500 per annum.My grandson went to Sir Simon Harcourt, the
Solicitor-General, to Windsor, to wait on my Lord Treasurer.There had
been for some time a proposal of marrying my grandson to a daughter of
Mrs.Boscawen, sister of my Lord Treasurer, which was now far advanced.I subscribed toward rebuilding Oakwood Chapel, now,
after 200 years, almost fallen down.The weather changed from heat not much less than in Italy
or Spain for some few days, to wet, dripping, and cold, with
intermissions of fair.I went to Kensington, and saw the house,
plantations, and gardens, the work of Mr.Wise, who was there to receive
me.The death of King James, happening on the 15th of this month, N. S.,
after two or three days' indisposition, put an end to that unhappy
Prince's troubles, after a short and unprosperous reign, indiscreetly
attempting to bring in Popery, and make himself absolute, in imitation
of the French, hurried on by the impatience of the Jesuits; which the
nation would not endure.Died the Earl of Bath, whose contest with Lord Montague about the Duke
of Albemarle's estate, claiming under a will supposed to have been
forged, is said to have been worth L10,000 to the lawyers.His eldest
son shot himself a few days after his father's death; for what cause is
not clear.He was a most hopeful young man, and had behaved so bravely
against the Turks at the siege of Vienna, that the Emperor made him a
Count of the Empire.It was falsely reported that Sir Edward Seymour was
dead, a great man; he had often been Speaker, Treasurer of the Navy, and
in many other lucrative offices.He was of a hasty spirit, not at all
sincere, but head of the party at any time prevailing in Parliament.I kept my first courts in Surrey, which took up
the whole week.Hervey, a Counsellor, Justice of
Peace, and Member of Parliament, and my neighbor.I gave him six
guineas, which was a guinea a day, and to Mr.Martin, his clerk, three
guineas.I was this day 81 complete, in tolerable health,
considering my great age.I gave my vote and
interest to Sir R. Onslow and Mr.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st January, 1701-02.At the Royal Society there was read and approved
the delineation and description of my Tables of Veins and Arteries, by
Mr.Cooper, the chirurgeon, in order to their being engraved.The King had a fall from his horse, and broke his
collar bone, and having been much indisposed before, and aguish, with a
long cough and other weakness, died this Sunday morning, about four
o'clock.I carried my accounts of Greenwich Hospital to the Committee.My brother-in-law, Glanville, departed this life this
morning after a long languishing illness, leaving a son by my sister,
and two granddaughters.Our relation and friendship had been long and
great.He died in the 84th year of his
age, and willed his body to be wrapped in lead and carried down to
Greenwich, put on board a ship, and buried in the sea, between Dover and
Calais, about the Goodwin sands; which was done on the Tuesday, or
Wednesday after.This occasioned much discourse, he having no relation
at all to the sea.He was a gentleman of an ancient family in
Devonshire, and married my sister Jane.By his prudent parsimony he much
improved his fortune.He had a place in the Alienation Office, and might
have been an extraordinary man, had he cultivated his parts.My steward at Wotton gave a very honest account of what he had laid out
on repairs, amounting to L1,900.The report of the committee sent to examine the state of
Greenwich hospital was delivered to the House of Commons, much to their
satisfaction.Being elected a member of the Society lately incorporated for the
propagation of the Gospel in foreign parts, I subscribed L10 per annum
toward the carrying it on.We agreed that every missioner, besides the
L20 to set him forth, should have L50 per annum out of the stock of the
Corporation, till his settlement was worth to him L100 per annum.We
sent a young divine to New York.I dined at the Archbishop's with the newly made Bishop
of Carlisle, Dr.Nicolson, my worthy and learned correspondent.I went to Wotton with my family for the rest of the
summer, and my son-in-law, Draper, with his family, came to stay with
us, his house at Addiscombe being new-building, so that my family was
above thirty.Most of the new Parliament were chosen of Church of
England principles, against the peevish party.The Queen was
magnificently entertained at Oxford and all the towns she passed through
on her way to Bath.Arrived now to the 82d year of my age, having read
over all that passed since this day twelvemonth in these notes, I render
solemn thanks to the Lord, imploring the pardon of my past sins, and the
assistance of his grace; making new resolutions, and imploring that he
will continue his assistance, and prepare me for my blessed Savior's
coming, that I may obtain a comfortable departure, after so long a term
as has been hitherto indulged me.I find by many infirmities this year
(especially nephritic pains) that I much decline; and yet of his
infinite mercy retain my intellect and senses in great measure above
most of my age.I have this year repaired much of the mansion house and
several tenants' houses, and paid some of my debts and engagements.My
wife, children, and family in health: for all which I most sincerely
beseech Almighty God to accept of these my acknowledgments, and that if
it be his holy will to continue me yet longer, it may be to the praise
of his infinite grace, and salvation of my soul.My kinsman, John Evelyn, of Nutfield, a young and
very hopeful gentleman, and Member of Parliament, after having come to
Wotton to see me, about fifteen days past, went to London and there died
of the smallpox.He left a brother, a commander in the army in Holland,
to inherit a fair estate.Our affairs in so prosperous a condition both by sea and land, that
there has not been so great an union in Parliament, Court, and people,
in memory of man, which God in mercy make us thankful for, and continue!The Bishop of Exeter preached before the Queen and both Houses of
Parliament at St.Paul's; they were wonderfully huzzaed in their
passage, and splendidly entertained in the city.The expectation now is, what treasure will be found on
breaking bulk of the galleon brought from Vigo by Sir George Rooke,
which being made up in an extraordinary manner in the hold, was not
begun to be opened till the fifth of this month, before two of the Privy
Council, two of the chief magistrates of the city, and the Lord
Treasurer.After the excess of honor conferred by the Queen on the Earl of
Marlborough, by making him a Knight of the Garter and a Duke, for the
success of but one campaign, that he should desire L5,000 a year to be
settled on him by Parliament out of the Post Office, was thought a bold
and unadvised request, as he had, besides his own considerable estate,
above L30,000 a year in places and employments, with L50,000 at
interest.He had married one daughter to the son of my Lord Treasurer
Godolphin, another to the Earl of Sunderland, and a third to the Earl of
Bridgewater.He is a very handsome person, well-spoken and affable, and
supports his want of acquired knowledge by keeping good company.News of Vice-Admiral Benbow's conflict with the French
fleet in the West Indies, in which he gallantly behaved himself, and was
wounded, and would have had extraordinary success, had not four of his
men-of-war stood spectators without coming to his assistance; for this,
two of their commanders were tried by a Council of War, and
executed;[94] a third was condemned to perpetual imprisonment, loss of
pay, and incapacity to serve in future.[Footnote 94: The Captains Kirby and Wade, having been tried and
    condemned to die by a court-martial held on them in the West Indies,
    were sent home in the "Bristol;" and, on its arrival at Portsmouth
    were both shot on board, not being suffered to land on English
    ground.]Oglethorpe (son of the late Sir Theo.fought on occasion of some words which passed at a committee of the
House.Oglethorpe was disarmed.The Bill against occasional
conformity was lost by one vote.Corn and provisions so cheap that the
farmers are unable to pay their rents.[Sidenote: LONDON]

February, 1703.A famous cause at the King's Bench between Mr.Fenwick
and his wife, which went for him with a great estate.The Duke of
Marlborough lost his only son at Cambridge by the smallpox.A great
earthquake at Rome, etc.A famous young woman, an Italian, was hired by
our comedians to sing on the stage, during so many plays, for which they
gave her L500; which part by her voice alone at the end of three scenes
she performed with such modesty and grace, and above all with such
skill, that there was never any who did anything comparable with their
voices.She was to go home to the Court of the King of Prussia, and I
believe carried with her out of this vain nation above L1,000, everybody
coveting to hear her at their private houses.Samuel Pepys, a very worthy,
industrious and curious person, none in England exceeding him in
knowledge of the navy, in which he had passed through all the most
considerable offices, Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of the Admiralty,
all which he performed with great integrity.went
out of England, he laid down his office, and would serve no more; but
withdrawing himself from all public affairs, he lived at Clapham with
his partner, Mr.Hewer, formerly his clerk, in a very noble house and
sweet place, where he enjoyed the fruit of his labors in great
prosperity.He was universally beloved, hospitable, generous, learned in
many things, skilled in music, a very great cherisher of learned men of
whom he had the conversation.His library and collection of other
curiosities were of the most considerable, the models of ships
especially.Besides what he published of an account of the navy, as he
found and left it, he had for divers years under his hand the History of
the Navy, or _Navalia_, as he called it; but how far advanced, and what
will follow of his, is left, I suppose, to his sister's son, Mr.Pepys had educated in all sorts of
useful learning, sending him to travel abroad, from whence he returned
with extraordinary accomplishments, and worthy to be heir.Pepys had
been for near forty years so much my particular friend, that Mr.Jackson
sent me complete mourning, desiring me to be one to hold up the pall at
his magnificent obsequies; but my indisposition hindered me from doing
him this last office.Rains have been great and continual, and now, near
midsummer, cold and wet.I went to Addiscombe, sixteen miles from Wotton, to
see my son-in-law's new house, the outside, to the coving, being such
excellent brickwork, based with Portland stone, with the pilasters,
windows, and within, that I pronounced it in all the points of good and
solid architecture to be one of the very best gentlemen's houses in
Surrey, when finished.I returned to Wotton in the evening, though
weary.The last week in this month an uncommon long-continued
rain, and the Sunday following, thunder and lightning.The new Commission for Greenwich hospital was sealed
and opened, at which my son-in-law, Draper, was present, to whom I
resigned my office of Treasurer.From August 1696, there had been
expended in building L89,364 14s.This day, being eighty-three years of age, upon
examining what concerned me, more particularly the past year, with the
great mercies of God preserving me, and in the same measure making my
infirmities tolerable, I gave God most hearty and humble thanks,
beseeching him to confirm to me the pardon of my sins past, and to
prepare me for a better life by the virtue of his grace and mercy, for
the sake of my blessed Savior.The wet and uncomfortable weather staying us from
church this morning, our Doctor officiated in my family; at which were
present above twenty domestics.55, 56, of the vanity of this world and uncertainty of life, and
the inexpressible happiness and satisfaction of a holy life, with
pertinent inferences to prepare us for death and a future state.I gave
him thanks, and told him I took it kindly as my funeral sermon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26-7th November, 1703.The effects of the hurricane and tempest of
wind, rain, and lightning, through all the nation, especially London,
were very dismal.As to my
own losses, the subversion of woods and timber, both ornamental and
valuable, through my whole estate, and about my house the woods crowning
the garden mount, the growing along the park meadow, the damage to my
own dwelling, farms, and outhouses, is almost tragical, not to be
paralleled, with anything happening in our age.I am not able to
describe it; but submit to the pleasure of Almighty God.I removed to Dover Street, where I found all well;
but houses, trees, garden, etc., at Sayes Court, suffered very much.I made up my accounts, paid wages, gave rewards and
New Year's gifts, according to custom.The King of Spain[95] landing at Portsmouth, came to
Windsor, where he was magnificently entertained by the Queen, and
behaved himself so nobly, that everybody was taken with his graceful
deportment.After two days, having presented the great ladies, and
others, with valuable jewels, he went back to Portsmouth, and
immediately embarked for Spain.[Footnote 95: Charles III., afterward Emperor of Germany, by the
    title of Charles VI.]The Lord Treasurer gave my grandson the office of
Treasurer of the Stamp Duties, with a salary of L300 a year.The fast on the Martyrdom of King Charles I. was
observed with more than usual solemnity.Bathurst, President of Trinity College, Oxford, now
died,[96] I think the oldest acquaintance now left me in the world.He
was eighty-six years of age, stark blind, deaf, and memory lost, after
having been a person of admirable parts and learning.This is a serious
alarm to me.He built a very handsome
chapel to the college, and his own tomb.He gave a legacy of money, and
a third part of his library, to his nephew, Dr.Bohun, who went hence to
his funeral.[Footnote 96: There is a very good Life of him, with his portrait
    prefixed, by Thomas Warton, Fellow of Trinity College, and Poetry
    Professor at Oxford.][Sidenote: LONDON]

7th September, 1704.This day was celebrated the thanksgiving for the
late great victory,[97] with the utmost pomp and splendor by the Queen,
Court, great Officers, Lords Mayor, Sheriffs, Companies, etc.The
streets were scaffolded from Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor presented
her Majesty with a sword, which she returned.Every company was ranged
under its banners, the city militia without the rails, which were all
hung with cloth suitable to the color of the banner.The Lord Mayor,
Sheriffs, and Aldermen were in their scarlet robes, with caparisoned
horses; the Knight Marshal on horseback; the Foot-Guards; the Queen in a
rich coach with eight horses, none with her but the Duchess of
Marlborough in a very plain garment, the Queen full of jewels.Music and
trumpets at every city company.The great officers of the Crown,
Nobility, and Bishops, all in coaches with six horses, besides
innumerable servants, went to St.After
this, the Queen went back in the same order to St.The city
companies feasted all the Nobility and Bishops, and illuminated at
night.Music for the church and anthems composed by the best masters.The day before was wet and stormy, but this was one of the most serene
and calm days that had been all the year.[Footnote 97: Over the French and Bavarians, at Blenheim, 13th
    August, 1704.]Being my birthday and the 84th year of my life,
after particular reflections on my concerns and passages of the year, I
set some considerable time of this day apart, to recollect and examine
my state and condition, giving God thanks, and acknowledging his
infinite mercies to me and mine, begging his blessing, and imploring his
protection for the year following.Lord Clarendon presented me with the three volumes of
his father's "History of the Rebellion."My Lord of Canterbury wrote to me for suffrage for Mr.Clarke's
continuance this year in the Boyle Lecture, which I willingly gave for
his excellent performance of this year.I went to wait on my Lord Treasurer, where was the
victorious Duke of Marlborough, who came to me and took me by the hand
with extraordinary familiarity and civility, as formerly he was used to
do, without any alteration of his good-nature.He had a most rich George
in a sardonyx set with diamonds of very great value; for the rest, very
plain.I had not seen him for some years, and believed he might have
forgotten me.Agues and smallpox much in
every place.Great loss by fire,
burning the outhouses and famous stable of the Earl of Nottingham, at
Burleigh [Rutlandshire], full of rich goods and furniture, by the
carelessness of a servant.A little before, the same happened at Lord
Pembroke's, at Wilton.The old Countess of Northumberland, Dowager of
Algernon Percy, Admiral of the fleet to King Charles I., died in the 83d
year of her age.She was sister to the Earl of Suffolk, and left a great
estate, her jointure to descend to the Duke of Somerset.On the death of the Emperor, there was no mourning worn at Court,
because there was none at the Imperial Court on the death of King
William.I went to see Sir John Chardin, at Turnham Green, the
gardens being very fine, and exceedingly well planted with fruit.Most extravagant expense to debauch and corrupt votes
for Parliament members.I sent my grandson with his party of my
freeholders to vote for Mr.I dined at Lambeth with the Archbishop of Dublin,
Dr.King, a sharp and ready man in politics, as well as very learned.We had long conversation about the philosopher's elixir,
which he believed attainable, and had seen projection himself by one who
went under the name of Mundanus, who sometimes came along among the
adepts, but was unknown as to his country, or abode; of this the doctor
had written a treatise in Latin, full of very astonishing relations.He
is a very learned person, formerly a Fellow of St.John's College,
Oxford, in which city he practiced physic, but has now altogether given
it over, and lives retired, being very old and infirm, yet continuing
chemistry.I went to Greenwich hospital, where they now began to take in wounded
and worn-out seamen, who are exceedingly well provided for.The
buildings now going on are very magnificent.[Sidenote: LONDON]

October, 1705.Observing how uncertain
great officers are of continuing long in their places, he would not
accept it, unless L2,000 a year were given him in reversion when he was
put out, in consideration of his loss of practice.His predecessors, how
little time soever they had the Seal, usually got L100,000 and made
themselves Barons.Lord Abington, Lieutenant
of the Tower, displaced, and General Churchill, brother to the Duke of
Marlborough, put in.An indication of great unsteadiness somewhere, but
thus the crafty Whig party (as called) begin to change the face of the
Court, in opposition to the High Churchmen, which was another
distinction of a party from the Low Churchmen.There had never been so great an assembly of members
on the first day of sitting, being more than 450.The votes both of the
old, as well as the new, fell to those called Low Churchmen, contrary to
all expectation.I am this day arrived to the 85th year of my age.Lord teach me so to number my days to come, that I may apply them to
wisdom!Making up my accounts for the past year, paid
bills, wages, and New Year's gifts, according to custom.Though much
indisposed and in so advanced a stage, I went to our chapel [in London]
to give God public thanks, beseeching Almighty God to assist me and my
family the ensuing year, if he should yet continue my pilgrimage here,
and bring me at last to a better life with him in his heavenly kingdom.Divers of our friends and relations dined with us this day.My indisposition increasing, I was exceedingly ill
this whole week.Notes of the sermons at the chapel in the morning and
afternoon, written with his own hand, conclude this Diary.[98]

humblest citizen.I want a nation that will protect a freedman standing
in the sun by his little cabin, just as quick as it would protect
Vanderbilt in a palace of marble and gold.No Repudiation

Then it was, that the serpent of temptation whispered in the ear of want
that dreadful word "Repudiation."They
appealed to want, to misery, to threatened financial ruin, to the bare
hearthstones, to the army of beggars, We had grandeur enough to say:
"No; we'll settle fair if we don't pay a cent!"Is there a Democrat now who wishes we had taken the advice of
Bayard to scale the bonds?Is there an American, a Democrat here, who
is not glad we escaped the stench and shame of repudiation, and did not
take Democratic advice?Is there a Greenbacker here who is not glad we
didn't do it?He may say he is, but he isn't.I think there is the greatest heroism in living for a thing!There's no
glory in digging potatoes.You don't wear a uniform when you're picking
up stones.You can't have a band of music when you dig potatoes!In,
1873 came the great crash.No one can estimate the anguish of that time!Millionaires found
themselves paupers.The aged man,
who had spent his life in hard labor, and who thought he had accumulated
enough to support himself in his old age, and leave a little something
to his children and grandchildren, found they were all beggars.The
highways were filled with tramps.Promises Don't Pay

If I am fortunate enough to leave a dollar when I die, I want it to be
a good one; I don't wish to have it turn to ashes in the hands of
widowhood, or become a Democratic broken promise in the pocket of the
orphan; I want it money.I saw not long ago a piece of gold bearing the
stamp of the Roman Empire.That Empire is dust, and over it has been
thrown the mantle of oblivion, but that piece of gold is as good as
though Julius Caesar were still riding at the head of the Roman Legion.I want money to that will outlive the Democratic party.They told
us--and they were honest about it--they said, "when we have plenty of
money we are prosperous."And I said: "When we are prosperous, then we
have credit, and, credit inflates the currency.Whenever a man buys a
pound of sugar and says, 'Charge it,' he inflates the currency; whenever
he gives his note, he inflates the currency; whenever his word takes the
place of money, he inflates the currency."The consequence is that when
we are prosperous, credit takes the place of money, and we have what
we call "plenty."But you can't increase prosperity simply by using
promises to pay.I do not wish to trust the wealth of this nation with the demagogues of
the nation.I do not wish to trust the wealth of the country to every
blast of public opinion.I want money as solid as the earth on which we
tread, as bright as the stars that shine above us.The South and the Tariff

Where did this doctrine of a tariff for revenue only come from?The South would like to stab the prosperity of the North.They
had rather trade with Old England than with New England.They had rather
trade with the people who were willing to help them in war than those
who conquered the rebellion.They knew what gave us our strength in
war.They knew all the brooks and creeks and rivers in New England were
putting down the rebellion.They knew that every wheel that turned,
every spindle that revolved, was a soldier in the army of human
progress.They were so lured by the greed of office that
they were willing to trade upon the misfortune of a nation.I don't wish to belong to a party that succeeds only when my country
falls.I don't wish to belong to a party whose banner went up with
the banner of rebellion.I don't wish to belong to a party that was in
partnership with defeat and disaster.I am for Protection

And I will tell you why I am for protection, too.If we were all farmers
we would be stupid.If we were all shoemakers we would be stupid.If
we all followed one business, no matter what it was, we would become
stupid.Protection to American labor diversifies American industry, and
to have it diversified touches and developes every part of the human
brain.Protection protects integrity; it protects intelligence; and
protection raises sense; and by protection we have greater men and
better-looking women and healthier children.Free trade means that our
laborer is upon an equality with the poorest paid labor of this world.The Old Woman of Tewksbury

You Greenbackers are like the old woman in the Tewksbury, Mass.,
Poor-House.She used to be well off, and didn't like her quarters.You
Greenbackers have left your father's house of many mansions and have fed
on shucks about long enough.The Supervisor came into the Poor-House one
day and asked the old lady how she liked it.She said she didn't like
the company, and asked him what he would advise her to do under similar
circumstances."Do you think anybody is ever prejudiced in their sleep?"I dreamed I died and went to
Heaven.A nice man came to me and asked
me where I was from.Says I, 'From Tewksbury, Mass.'He looked in his
book and said, 'You can't stay here.'"I asked what he would advise me
to do under similar circumstances."'Well,' he said, 'there's hell down
there, you might try that.'"Well, I went down there, and the men told
me my name wasn't on the book and I couldn't stay there.'Well,' said I,
'What would you advise me to do under similar circumstances?''Said he,
'You'll have to go back to Tewksbury.'And when Green-backers remember
what they once were, you must feel now, when you were forced to join
the Democratic party, as bad as the old lady who had to go back to
Tewksbury.American Muscle, Coined into Gold

I believe in American labor, and I tell you why.The other day a man
told me that we had produced in the United States of America one million
tons of rails.In other
words, the million tons are worth $60,000,000.How much is a ton of iron
worth in the ground?American labor takes 25 cents of
iron in the ground and adds to it $59.75.One million tons of rails, and
the raw material not worth $24,000.We build a ship in the United States
worth $500,000, and the value of the ore in the earth, of the trees in
the great forest, of all that enters into the composition of that ship
bringing $500,000 in gold is only $20,000; $480,000 by American labor,
American muscle, coined into gold; American brains made a legal-tender
the world around.Inflation

I don't blame the man who wanted inflation.I don't blame him for
praying for another period of inflation."When it comes," said the man
who had a lot of shrunken property on his hands, "blame me, if I don't
unload, you may shoot me."It's a good deal like the game of poker!I
don't suppose any of you know anything about that game!Along towards
morning the fellow who is ahead always wants another deal.The fellow
that is behind says his wife's sick, and he must go home.You ought
to hear that fellow descant on domestic virtue!And the other fellow
accuses him of being a coward and wanting to jump the game.A man whose
dead wood is hung up on the shore in a dry time, wants the water to rise
once more and float it out into the middle of the stream.We have fifty-six thousand
square miles of land--nearly thirty-six million acres.Upon these plains
we can raise enough to feed and clothe twenty million people.Beneath
these prairies were hidden, millions of ages ago, by that old miser, the
sun, thirty-six thousand square miles of coal.The aggregate thickness
of these veins is at least fifteen feet.Think of a column of coal one
mile square and one hundred miles high!What
a sunbeam such a column would be!Think of all this force, willed and
left to us by the dead morning of the world!Think of the fireside of
the future around which will sit the fathers, mothers and children of
the years to be!Think of the sweet and happy faces, the loving and
tender eyes that will glow and gleam in the sacred light of all these
flames!They say that money is a measure of value.A bushel doesn't
measure values.If it measured
values, a bushel of potatoes would be worth as much as a bushel of
diamonds.They used to say,
"there's no use in having a gold yard-stick."You
don't buy the yard-stick.If money bore the same relation to trade as
a yard-stick or half-bushel, you would have the same money when you
got through trading as you had when you begun.A man don't sell
half-bushels.All we want is a little sense about these
things.Some said there
wasn't enough money.That's so; I know what that means myself.They said
if we had more money we'd be more prosperous.The truth is, if we
were more prosperous we'd have more money.They said more money would
facilitate business.Money by Work

How do you get your money?You have got to dig it
out of the ground.In old times there were
some men who thought they could get some way to turn the baser metals
into gold, and old gray-haired men, trembling, tottering on the verge of
the grave, were hunting for something to turn ordinary metals into gold;
they were searching for the fountain of eternal youth, but they did not
find it.No human ear has ever heard the silver gurgle of the spring of
immortal youth.Meat Twice a Year

I have been in countries where the laboring man had meat once a year;
sometimes twice--Christmas and Easter.And I have seen women carrying
upon their heads a burden that no man would like to carry, and at the
same time knitting busily with both hands.And those women lived without
meat; and when I thought of the American laborer I said to myself,
"After all, my country is the best in the world."And when I came back
to the sea and saw the old flag flying in the air, it seemed to me as
though the air from pure joy had burst into blossom.America a Glorious Land

Labor has more to eat and more to wear in the United States than in
any other land of this earth.I want America to produce everything
that Americans need.I want it so if the whole world should declare war
against us, so if we were surrounded by walls of cannon and bayonets and
swords, we could supply all human wants in and of ourselves.I want to
live to see the American woman dressed in American silk; the American
man in everything from hat to boots produced in America by the cunning
hand of the American toiler.How to Spend a Dollar

If you have only a dollar in the world and have got to spend it, spend
it like a man; spend it like a prince, like a king!If you have to spend
it, spend it as though it were a dried leaf, and you were the owner of
unbounded forests.Honesty is Best always and Everywhere

I am next in favor of honest money.I am in favor of gold and silver,
and paper with gold and silver behind it.I believe in silver, because
it is one of the greatest of American products, and I am in favor of
anything that will add to the value of American products.But I want a
silver dollar worth a gold dollar, even if you make it or have to make
it four feet in diameter.No government can afford to be a clipper of
coin.A great Republic cannot afford to stamp a lie upon silver or gold.Honest money, an honest people, an honest Nation.When our money is only
worth 80 cents on the dollar, we feel 20 per cent, below par.When our
money is good we feel good.When our money is at par, that is where we
are.I am a profound believer in the doctrine that for nations as well
as men, honesty is the best, always, everywhere and forever.A Fountain of Greenbacks

There used to be mechanics that tried to make perpetual motion by
combinations of wheels, shifting weights, and rolling balls; but somehow
the machine would never quite run.A perpetual fountain of greenbacks,
of wealth without labor, is just as foolish as a fountain of eternal
youth.The idea that you can produce money without labor is just as
foolish as the idea of perpetual motion.They are old follies under new
names.We had to borrow some money to pay for shot and
shell to shoot Democrats with.We found that we could get along with a
few less Democrats, but not with any less country, and so we borrowed
the money, and the question now is, will we pay it?And which party is
the most apt to pay it, the Republican party, that made the debt--the
party that swore it was constitutional, or the party that said it was
unconstitutional?Whenever a Democrat sees a greenback, the greenback
says to the Democrat, "I am one of the fellows that whipped you."Whenever a Republican sees a greenback, the greenback says to him, "You
and I put down the rebellion and saved the country."Honest Methods

So many presidents of savings banks, even those belonging to the Young
Men's Christian Association, run off with the funds; so many railroad
and insurance companies are in the hands of receivers; there is so much
bankruptcy on every hand, that all capital is held in the nervous clutch
of fear.Slowly, but surely, we are coming back to honest methods in
business.Confidence will return, and then enterprise will unlock the
safe and money will again circulate as of yore; the dollars will leave
their hitting places, and every one will be seeking investment.For my part I do not ask any interference on the part of the government
except to undo the wrong it has done.I do not ask that money be made
out of nothing.I do not ask for the prosperity born of paper.But I do
ask for the remonetization of silver.It was an imposition upon every solvent man; a fraud upon every honest
debtor in the United States.It was done in the
interest of avarice and greed, and should be undone by honest men.RELIGIOUS QUESTIONS




171.Redden your hands with human blood; blast by slander the fair fame
of the innocent; strangle the smiling child upon its mother's knees;
deceive, ruin and desert the beautiful girl who loves and trusts you,
and your case is not hopeless.For all this, and for all these you
may be forgiven.For all this, and for all these, that bankrupt court
established by the gospel, will give you a discharge; but deny the
existence of these divine ghosts, of these gods, and the sweet and
tearful face of Mercy becomes livid with eternal hate.Heaven's golden
gates are shut, and you, with an infinite curse ringing in your
ears, with the brand of infamy upon your brow, commence your endless
wanderings in the lurid gloom of hell--an immortal vagrant--an eternal
outcast--a deathless convict.Faith--A Mixture of Insanity and Ignorance

The doctrine that future happiness depends upon belief is monstrous.It is the infamy of infamies.The notion that faith in Christ is to
be rewarded by an eternity of bliss, while a dependence upon reason,
observation, and experience merits everlasting pain, is too absurd for
refutation, and can be relieved only by that unhappy mixture of insanity
and ignorance; called "faith."The church in the days of Voltaire contended that its servants were the
only legitimate physicians.The priests cured in the name of the church,
and in the name of God--by exorcism, relics, water, salt and oil.Gervasius was good for rheumatism, St.Ovidius
for deafness, St.Apollonia for
toothache, St.Clara for rheum in the eye, St.Devils were driven out with wax tapers, with incence (sp.), with holy
water, by pronouncing prayers.The church, as late as the middle of the
twelfth century, prohibited good Catholics from having anything to do
with physicians.The Sleep of Persecutors

All the persecutors sleep in peace, and the ashes of those who burned
their brothers in the name of Christ rest in consecrated ground.Whole
libraries could not contain even the names of the wretches who have
filled the world with violence and death in defense of book and creed,
and yet they all died the death of the righteous, and no priest or|
minister describes the agony and fear, the remorse and horror with which
their guilty souls were filled in the last moments of their lives.These
men had never doubted; they accepted the creed; they were not infidels;
they had not denied the divinity of Christ; they had been baptized;
they had partaken of the last supper; they had respected priests; they
admitted that the Holy Ghost had "proceeded;" and these things put
pillows beneath their dying heads and covered them with the drapery of
peace.There is no recorded instance where the uplifted hand of murder has been
paralyzed--no truthful account in all the literature of the world of the
innocent shielded by God.Thousands of crimes are being committed every
day--men are this moment lying in wait for their human prey; wives
are whipped and crushed, driven to insanity and death; little children
begging for mercy, lifting imploringly tear-filled eyes to the brutal
faces of fathers and mothers; sweet girls are deceived, lured, and
outraged; but God has no time to prevent these things--no time to defend
the good and to protect the pure.He is too busy numbering hairs and
watching sparrows.All kinds of criminals, except infidels, meet death with reasonable
serenity.As a rule, there is nothing in the death of a pirate to cast
any discredit on his profession.The murderer upon the scaffold, with
a priest on either side, smilingly exhorts the multitude to meet him in
heaven.The man who has succeeded in making his home a hell meets death
without a quiver, provided he has never expressed any doubt as to the
divinity of Christ or the eternal "procession" of the holy ghost.The
king who has waged cruel and useless war, who has filled countries with
widows and fatherless children, with the maimed and diseased, and who
has succeeded in offering to the Moloch of ambition the best and bravest
of his subjects, dies like a saint.The first Corpse and the first Cathedral

Now and then, in the history of this world, a man of genius, of sense,
of intellectual honesty has appeared.These men have denounced the
superstitions of their day.To see priests
devour the substance of the people filled them with indignation.These
men were honest enough to tell their thoughts.Then they were denounced,
condemned, executed.Some of them escaped the fury of the people who
loved their enemies, and died naturally in their beds.It would not be
for the church to admit that they died peacefully.That would show that
religion was not actually necessary in the last moment.Religion got
much of its power from the terror of death.Superstition is the child of
ignorance and fear.The first
corpse was the first priest.It would not do to have the common people
understand that a man could deny the Bible, refuse to look at the cross,
contend that Christ was only a man, and yet die as calmly as Calvin did
after he had murdered Servetus, or as King David, after advising one son
to kill another.The Sixteenth Century

In the sixteenth century every science was regarded as an outcast and an
enemy, and the church influenced the world, which was under its
power, to believe anything, and the ignorant mob was always too ready,
brutalized by the church, to hang, kill or crucify at their bidding.Such was the result of a few centuries of Christianity.An Orthodox Gentleman

By Orthodox I mean a gentleman who is petrified in his mind, whooping
around intellectually, simply to save the funeral expenses of his soul.A Bold Assertion

The churches point to their decayed saints, and their crumbled Popes
and say, "Do you know more than all the ministers that ever lived?"And without the slightest egotism or blush I say, yes, and the name of
Humboldt outweighs them all.The men who stand in the front rank, the
men who know most of the secrets of nature, the men who know most are
to-day the advanced infidels of this world.I have lived long enough to
see the brand of intellectual inferiority on every orthodox brain.If we admit that some infinite being has controlled the destinies of
persons and peoples, history becomes a most cruel and bloody farce.Age after age, the strong have trampled upon the weak; the crafty
and heartless have ensnared and enslaved the simple and innocent,
and nowhere, in all the annals of mankind, has any god succored the
oppressed.Weak ones Suffering--Heaven deaf

Most of the misery has been endured by the weak, the loving and the
innocent.Women have been treated like poisonous beasts, and little
children trampled upon as though they had been vermin.Numberless altars
have been reddened, even with the blood of babes; beautiful girls have
been given to slimy serpents; whole races of men doomed to centuries
of slavery, and everywhere there has been outrage beyond the power
of genius to express.During all these years the suffering have
supplicated; the withered lips of famine have prayed; the pale victims
have implored, and Heaven has been deaf and blind.Heaven has no Ear, no Hand

Man should cease to expect aid from on high.By this time he should know
that heaven has no ear to hear, and no hand to help.The present is the
necessary child of all the past.There has been no chance, and there can
be no interference.Religion is Tyrannical

Religion does not, and cannot, contemplate man as free.She accepts only
the homage of the prostrate, and scorns the offerings of those who stand
erect.The wide and sunny
fields belong not to her domain.The star-lit heights of genius and
individuality are above and beyond her appreciation and power.Her
subjects cringe at her feet, covered with the dust of obedience.Religion and Facts

What has religion to do with facts?Is there any such thing
as Methodist mathematics, Presbyterian botany, Catholic astronomy or
Baptist biology?What has any form of superstition or religion to do
with a fact or with any science?Nothing but hinder, delay or embarass.I want, then, to free the schools; and I want to free the politicians,
so that a man will not have to pretend he is a Methodist, or his wife
a Baptist, or his grandmother a Catholic; so that he can go through
a campaign, and when he gets through will find none of the dust of
hypocrisy on his knees.Religion not the End of Life

We deny that religion is the end or object of this life.When it is so
considered it becomes destructive of happiness--the real end of life.It becomes a hydra-headed monster, reaching in terrible coils from the
heavens, and thrusting its thousand fangs into the bleeding, quivering
hearts of men.It devours their substance, builds palaces for God, (who
dwells not in temples made with hands,) and allows his children to
die in huts and hovels.It fills the earth with mourning, heaven with
hatred, the present with fear, and all the future with despair.Creeds

Just in proportion that the human race has advanced, the Church has lost
power.No nation ever materially
advanced that held strictly to the religion of its founders.No nation
ever gave itself wholly to the control of the Church without losing its
power, its honor, and existence.Every Church pretends to have found
the exact truth.Every creed is a rock in running
water; humanity sweeps by it.Every creed cries to the universe, "Halt!"A creed is the ignorant Past bullying the enlightened Present.The Worst Religion in the World

The worst religion of the world was the Presbyterianism of Scotland as
it existed in the beginning of the eighteenth century.The kirk had all
the faults of the church of Rome, without a redeeming feature.The kirk
hated music, painting, statuary, and architecture.Anything touched with
humanity--with the dimples of joy--was detested and accursed.God was
to be feared, not loved.Happiness was a snare, and human love was wicked,
weak, and vain.The Presbyterian priest of Scotland was as cruel,
bigoted, and heartless as the familiar of the inquisition.In the beginning of this, the nineteenth century, a boy
seventeen years of age, Thomas Aikenhead, was indicted and tried
at Edinburgh for blasphemy.He had on several occasions, when cold,
jocularly wished himself in hell, that he might get warm.The poor,
frightened boy recanted--begged for mercy; but he was found guilty,
hanged, thrown in a hole at the foot of the scaffold; and his weeping
mother vainly begged that his bruised and bleeding body might be given
to her.Religion Demanding Miracles

The founder of a religion must be able to turn water into wine--cure
with a word the blind and lame, and raise with a simple touch the dead
to life.It was necessary for him to demonstrate to the satisfaction
of his barbarian disciple, that he was superior to nature.In times of
ignorance this was easy to do.The credulity of the savage was almost
boundless.To him the marvelous was the beautiful, the mysterious was
the sublime.Consequently, every religion has for its foundation a
miracle--that is to say, a violation of nature--that is to say, a
falsehood.We Want One Fact

We have heard talk enough.We have listened to all the drowsy, idealess,
vapid sermons that we wish to hear.We have read your Bible and the
works of your best minds.We have heard your prayers, your solemn groans
and your reverential amens.We beg at the doors of your churches for just one little
fact.We pass our hats along your pews and under your pulpits and
implore you for just one fact.We know all about your mouldy wonders and
your stale miracles.The Design Argument

These religious people see nothing but designs everywhere, and personal,
intelligent interference in everything.They insist that the universe
has been created, and that the adaptation of means to ends is perfectly
apparent.They point us to the sunshine, to the flowers, to the April
rain, and to all there is of beauty and of use in the world.Did it ever
occur to them that a cancer is as beautiful in its development as is the
reddest rose?That what they are pleased to call the adaptation of
means to ends, is as apparent in the cancer as in the April rain?By what ingenious methods the
blood is poisoned so that the cancer shall have food!By what wonderful
contrivances the entire system of man is made to pay tribute to this
divine and charming cancer!See by what admirable instrumentalities it
feeds itself from the surrounding quivering, dainty flesh!See how it
gradually but surely expands and grows!By what marvelous mechanism
it is supplied with long and slender roots that reach out to the most
secret nerves of pain for sustenance and life!Down, Forever Down

Down, forever down, with any religion that requires upon its ignorant
altar the sacrifice of the goddess Reason, that compels her to abdicate
forever the shining throne of the soul, strips from her form the
imperial purple, snatches from her hand the sceptre of thought and makes
her the bondwoman of a senseless faith!The Back

Upon this rack I have described, this victim was placed, and those
chains were attached to his ankles and then to his waist, and clergyman,
good men pious men!men that were shocked at the immorality of their
day!they talked about playing cards and the horrible crime of dancing!how such things shocked them; men going to the theatres and seeing a
play written by the grandest genius the world ever has produced--how it
shocked their sublime and tender souls!but they commenced turning this
machine and they kept on turning until the ankles, knees, hips, elbows,
shoulders and wrists were all dislocated and the victim was red with the
sweat of agony, and they had standing by a physician to feel the pulse,
so that the last faint flutter of life would not leave his veins.simply that they might
have the pleasure of racking him once again.That is the spirit, and it
is a spirit born of the doctrine that there is upon the throne of the
universe a being who will eternally damn his children, and they said:
"If God is going to have the supreme happiness of burning them forever,
certainly he might not to begrudge to us the joy of burning them for an
hour or two."That was their doctrine, and when I read these things it
seems to me that I have suffered them myself.An Awful Admission

Just think of going to the day of judgment, if there is one, and
standing up before God and admitting without a blush that you had lived
and died a Scotch Presbyterian.I would expect the next sentence would
be, "Depart ye curged into everlasting fire."CHURCHES AND PRIESTS




195.The Church Forbids Investigation

The first doubt was the womb and cradle of progress, and from the first
doubt, man has continued to advance.Men began to investigate, and the
church began to oppose.The astronomer scanned the heavens, while the
church branded his grand forehead with the word, "Infidel;" and now,
not a glittering star in all the vast expanse bears a Christian name.In spite of all religion, the geologist penetrated the earth, read her
history in books of stone, and found, hidden within her bosom souvenirs
of all the ages.The Church Charges Falsely

Notwithstanding the fact that infidels in all ages have battled for
the rights of man, and have at all times been the fearless advocates
of liberty and justice, we are constantly charged by the Church with
tearing down without building again.The Church in the "Dark Ages"

During that frightful period known as the "Dark Ages," Faith reigned,
with scarcely a rebellious subject.Her temples were "carpeted with
knees," and the wealth of nations adorned her countless shrines.The
great painters prostituted their genius to immortalize her vagaries,
while the poets enshrined them in song.At her bidding, man covered the
earth with blood.The scales of Justice were turned with her gold, and
for her use were invented all the cunning instruments of pain.She built
cathedrals for God, and dungeons for men.She peopled the clouds with
angels and the earth with slaves.For ages, a deadly conflict has been waged between a few brave men and
women of thought and genius upon the one side, and the great ignorant
religious mass on the other.The few have appealed to reason, to honor, to law, to freedom, to the
known, and to happiness here in this world.The many have appealed
to prejudice, to fear, to miracle, to slavery, to the unknown, and
to misery hereafter.The many have said,
"Believe!"The Church and the Tree of Knowledge

The gods dreaded education and knowledge then just as they do now.The
church still faithfully guards the dangerous tree of knowledge, and has
exerted in all ages her utmost power to keep mankind from eating the
fruit thereof.The priests have never ceased repeating the old falsehood
and the old threat: "Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it,
lest ye die."Let the church, or one of its
intellectual saints, perform a miracle, and we will believe.We are told
that nature has a superior.Let this superior, for one single instant,
control nature and we will admit the truth of your assertions.The Heretics Cried, "Halt!"A few infidels--a few heretics cried, "Halt!"to the great rabble of
ignorant devotion, and made it possible for the genius of the nineteenth
century to revolutionize the cruel creeds and superstitions of mankind.The World not so Awful Flat

According to the Christian system this world was the centre of
everything.The stars were made out of what little God happened to have
left when he got the world done.God lived up in the sky, and they said
this earth must rest upon something, and finally science passed its hand
clear under, and there was nothing.It was self-existent in infinite
space.Then the Church began to say they didn't say it was flat, not so
awful flat--it was kind of rounding.According to the ancient Christians God lived from all eternity, and
never worked but six days in His whole life, and then had the impudence
to tell us to be industrious.Christian nations are the warlike nations of this world.Christians have
invented the most destructive weapons of war.Christianity gave us the
revolver, invented the rifle, made the bombshell; and Christian
nations here and there had above all other arts the art of war; and as
Christians they have no respect for the rights of barbarians or for the
rights of any nation or tribe that happens to differ with them.See what
it does in our society; we are divided off into little sects that used
to discuss these questions with fire and sword, with chain and <DW19>,
and that discuss, some of them, even to-day, with misrepresentation and
slander.Every day something happens to show me that the old spirit that
that was in the inquisition still slumbers in the breasts of men.Another Day of Divine Work

I heard of a man going to California over the plains, and there was a
clergyman on board, and he had a great deal to say, and finally he
fell in conversation with the forty-niner, and the latter said to the
clergyman, "Do you believe that God made this world in six days?"They were then going along the Humboldt.Says he, "Don't you think
he could put in another day to advantage right around here?"The Donkey and the Lion

Owing to the attitude of the churches for the last fifteen hundred
years, truth-telling has not been a very lucrative business.As a rule,
hypocrisy has worn the robes, and honesty the rags.You cannot now answer the argument of a man by pointing at
the holes in his coat.Thomas Paine attacked the Church when it was
powerful--when it had what is called honors to bestow--when it was
the keeper of the public conscience--when it was strong and cruel.The
Church waited till he was dead, and then attacked his reputation and his
clothes.Once upon a time a donkey kicked a lion, but the lion was dead.The Orthodox Christian

The highest type of the orthodox Christian does not forget; neither
does he learn.He is a living fossil
embedded in that rock called faith.He makes no effort to better his
condition, because all his strength is exhausted in keeping other people
from improving theirs.The supreme desire of his heart is to force all
others to adopt his creed, and in order to accomplish this object he
denounces free-thinking as a crime, and this crime he calls heresy.When
he had power, heresy was the most terrible and formidable of words.It
meant confiscation, exile, imprisonment, torture, and death.Alms-Dish and Sword

I will not say the Church has been an unmitigated evil in all respects.It has delighted in the production
of extremes.It has furnished murderers for its own martyrs.It has
sometimes fed the body, but has always starved the soul.It has been a
charitable highwayman--a profligate beggar--a generous pirate.It
has produced some angels and a multitude of devils.It has built more
prisons than asylums.It made a hundred orphans while it cared for one.In one hand it has carried the alms-dish and in the other a sword.The Church the Great Robber

The Church has been, and still is, the great robber.She has rifled not
only the pockets but the brains of the world.She is the stone at the
sepulchre of liberty; the upas tree, in whose shade the intellect of man
has withered; the Gorgon beneath whose gaze the human heart has turned
to stone.Under her influence even the Protestant mother expects to be
happy in heaven, while her brave boy, who fell fighting for the rights
of man, shall writhe in hell.The Church Impotent

The Church, impotent and malicious, regrets, not the abuse, but the loss
of her power, and seeks to hold by falsehood what she gained by cruelty
and force, by fire and fear.Christianity cannot live in peace with any
other form of faith.Toleration

Let it be remembered that all churches have persecuted heretics to the
extent of their power.Toleration has increased only when and where the
power of the church has diminished.From Augustine until now the
spirit of the Christians has remained the same.There has been the same
intolerance, the same undying hatred of all who think for themselves,
and the same determination to crush out of the human brain all knowledge
inconsistent with an ignorant creed.Shakespeare's Plays v. Sermons

What would the church people think if the theatrical people should
attempt to suppress the churches?What harm would it do to have an opera
here tonight?It would elevate us more than to hear ten thousand sermons
on the worm that never dies.There is more practical wisdom in one of
the plays of Shakespeare than in all the sacred books ever written.What
wrong would there be to see one of those grand plays on Sunday?There
was a time when the church would not allow you to cook on Sunday.You
had to eat your victuals cold.There was a time they thought the more
miserable you feel the better God feels.Give any orthodox church the power, and to-day they would punish heresy
with whip, and chain, and fire.As long as a church deems a certain
belief essential to salvation, just so long it will kill and burn if it
has the power.Why should the Church pity a man whom her God hates?Why
should she show mercy to a kind and noble heretic whom her God will burn
in eternal fire?Cathedrals and domes, and chimes and chants--temples frescoed and
groined and carved, and gilded with gold--altars and tapers, and
paintings of virgin and babe--censer and chalice--chasuble, paten
and alb--organs, and anthems and incense rising to the winged and
blest--maniple, amice and stole--crosses and crosiers, tiaras
and crowns--mitres and missals and masses--rosaries, relics and
robes--martyrs and saints, and windows stained as with the blood of
Christ--never, never for one moment awed the brave, proud spirit of the
Infidel.He knew that all the pomp and glitter had been purchased with
Liberty--that priceless jewel of the soul.In looking at the cathedral
he remembered the dungeon.The music of the organ was loud enough to
drown the clank of fetters.He could not forget that the taper had
lighted the fagot.He knew that the cross adorned the hilt of the sword,
and so where others worshiped, he wept and scorned.Back to Chaos

Suppose the Church could control the world today, we would go back to
chaos and old night philosophy would be branded as infamous; science
would again press its pale and thoughtful face against the prison bars,
and round the limbs of liberty would climb the bigot's flame.Infinite Impudence of the Church

Who can imagine the infinite impudence of a Church assuming to think for
the human race?Who can imagine the infinite impudence of a Church
that pretends to be the mouthpiece of God, and in his name threatens to
inflict eternal punishment upon those who honestly reject its claims and
scorn its pretensions?By what right does a man, or an organization
of men, or a god, claim to hold a brain in bondage?When a fact can be
demonstrated, force is unnecessary; when it cannot be demonstrated, an
appeal to force is infamous.In the presence of the unknown all have an
equal right to think.Wanted!--A New Method

The world is covered with forts to protect Christians from Christians,
and every sea is covered with iron monsters ready to blow Christian
brains into eternal froth.Millions upon millions are annually expended
in the effort to construct still more deadly and terrible engines of
death.Industry is crippled, honest toil is robbed, and even beggary is
taxed to defray the expenses of Christian warfare.There must be some
other way to reform this world.The Kirk of Scotland

The Church was ignorant, bloody, and relentless.In Scotland the "Kirk"
was at the summit of its power.It was a full sister of the Spanish
Inquisition.It was the enemy of
happiness, the hater of joy, and the despiser of religious liberty.It
taught parents to murder their children rather than to allow them to
propagate error.If the mother held opinions of which the infamous
"Kirk" disapproved, her children were taken from her arms, her babe from
her very bosom, and she was not allowed to see them, or to write them a
word.It would not allow shipwrecked sailors to be rescued from drowning
on Sunday.It sought to annihilate pleasure, to pollute the heart by
filling it with religious cruelty and gloom, and to change mankind into
a vast horde of pious, heartless fiends.One of the most famous Scotch
divines said: "The Kirk holds that religious toleration is not far from
blasphemy."The Church Looks Back

The Church is, and always has been, incapable of a forward movement.The Church has already reduced Spain to a
guitar, Italy to a hand-organ, and Ireland to exile.Diogenes

The Church used painting, music and architecture, simply to degrade
mankind.There have been at all
times brave spirits that dared even the gods.Some proud head has always
been above the waves.In every age some Diogenes has sacrificed to all
the gods.True genius never cowers, and there is always some Samson
feeling for the pillars of authority.The Church and War

It does seem as though the most zealous Christian must at times
entertain some doubt as to the divine origin of his religion.For
eighteen hundred years the doctrine has been preached.For more than
a thousand years the Church had, to a great extent, the control of the
civilized world, and what has been the result?Are the Christian nations
patterns of charity and forbearance?On the contrary, their principal
business is to destroy each other.More than five millions of Christians
are trained, educated, and drilled to murder their fellow-christians.Every nation is groaning under a vast debt incurred in carrying on war
against other Christians.The Call to Preach

An old deacon, wishing to get rid of an unpopular preacher, advised him
to give up the ministry and turn his attention to something else.The
preacher replied that he could not conscientiously desert the pulpit, as
he had had a "call" to the ministry.To which the deacon replied, "That
may be so, but it's very unfortunate for you, that when God called you
to preach, he forgot to call anybody to hear you."Burning Servetus

The maker of the Presbyterian creed caused the fugitive Servetus to be
arrested for blasphemy.He was
convicted and condemned to death by fire.On the morning of the fatal
day, Calvin saw him, and Servetus, the victim, asked forgiveness of
Calvin, the murderer.Servetus was bound to the stake, and the <DW19>s
were lighted.The wind carried the flames somewhat away from his body,
so that he slowly roasted for hours.Vainly he implored a speedy death.At last the flames climbed round his form; through smoke and fire his
murderers saw a white, heroic face.And there they watched until a man
became a charred and shriveled mass.Liberty was banished from Geneva,
and nothing but Presbyterianism was left.Freedom for the Clergy

One of the first things I wish to do is to free the orthodox clergy.I
am a great friend of theirs, and in spite of all they may say against
me, I am going to do them a great and lasting service.Upon their necks
are visible the marks of the collar, and upon their backs those of the
lash.They are not allowed to read and think for themselves.They are
taught like parrots, and the best are those who repeat, with the fewest
mistakes, the sentences they have been taught.They sit like owls upon
some dead limb of the tree of knowledge, and hoot the same old hoots
that have been hooted for eighteen hundred years.The Pulpit Weakening

There was a time when a falsehood, fulminated from the pulpit, smote
like a sword; but, the supply having greatly exceeded the demand,
clerical misrepresentation has at last become almost an innocent
amusement.Remembering that only a few years ago men, women, and even
children, were imprisoned, tortured and burned, for having expressed
in an exceedingly mild and gentle way, the ideas entertained by me, I
congratulate myself that calumny is now the pulpit's last resort.Origin of the Priesthood

This was the origin of the priesthood.The priest pretended to stand
between the wrath of the gods and the helplessness of man.He was man's
attorney at the court of heaven.He carried to the invisible world a
flag of truce, a protest and a request.He came back with a command,
with authority and with power.Man fell upon his knees before his own
servant, and the priest, taking advantage of the awe inspired by his
supposed influence with the gods, made of his fellow-man a cringing
hypocrite and slave.The Clergy on Heaven

The clergy, however, balance all the real ills of this life with the
expected joys of the next.We are assured that all is perfection in
heaven--there the skies are cloudless--there all is serenity and peace.Here empires may be overthrown; dynasties may be extinguished in blood;
millions of slaves may toil 'neath the fierce rays of the sun, and the
cruel strokes of the lash; yet all is happiness in heaven.Pestilences
may strew the earth with corpses of the loved; the survivors may bend
above them in agony--yet the placid bosom of heaven is unruffled.Children may expire vainly asking for bread; babes may be devoured by
serpents, while the gods sit smiling in the clouds.The Parson, the Crane and the Fish

A devout clergyman sought every opportunity to impress upon the mind
of his son the fact, that God takes care of all his creatures; that the
falling sparrow attracts his attention, and that his loving-kindness is
over all his works.Happening, one day, to see a crane wading in quest
of food, the good man pointed out to his son the perfect adaptation of
the crane to get his living in that manner."See," said he, "how his
legs are formed for wading!Observe how
nicely he folds his feet when putting them in or drawing them out of
the water!He is thus enabled
to approach the fish without giving them any notice of his arrival.My son," said he, "it is impossible to look at that bird without
recognizing the design, as well as the goodness of God, in thus
providing the means of subsistence.""Yes," replied the boy, "I think I
see the goodness of God, at least so far as the crane is concerned; but,
after all, father, don't you think the arrangement a little tough on the
fish?"Give me the storm of tempest and action, rather than the dead calm of
ignorance and faith.Banish me from Eden when you will; but first let me
eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge!The Pulpit's Cry of Fear

From every pulpit comes the same cry, born of the same fear: "Lest
they eat and become as gods, knowing good and evil."For this reason,
religion hates science, faith detests reason, theology is the sworn
enemy of philosophy, and the church with its flaming sword still guards
the hated tree, and like its supposed founder, curses to the lowest
depths the brave thinkers who eat and become as gods.Restive Clergymen

Some of the clergy have the independence to break away, and the
intellect to maintain themselves as free men, but the most are compelled
to submit to the dictation of the orthodox, and the dead.They are
not employed to give their thoughts, but simply to repeat the ideas of
others.They are not expected to give even the doubts that may suggest
themselves, but are required to walk in the narrow, verdureless path
trodden by the ignorance of the past.The forests and fields on either
side are nothing to them.The Parson Factory at Andover

They have in Massachusetts, at a place called Andover, a kind of
minister-factory; and every professor in that factory takes an oath once
in every five years--that is as long as an oath will last--that not only
has he not during the last five years, but so help him God, he will not
during the next five years intellectually advance; and probably there is
no oath he could easier keep.Since the foundation of that institution
there has not been one case of perjury.They believe the same creed they
first taught when the foundation stone was laid, and now when they send
out a minister they brand him as hardware from Sheffield and Birmingham.And every man who knows where he was educated knows his creed, knows
every argument of his creed, every book that he reads, and just what he
amounts to intellectually, and knows he will shrink and shrivel.A Charge to Presbyteries

Go on, presbyteries and synods, go on!Thrust the heretics out of the
Church--that is to say, throw away your brains,--put out your eyes.Every
deserter from your camp is a recruit for the army of progress.Cling to
the ignorant dogmas of the past; read the 109th Psalm; gloat over the
slaughter of mothers and babes; thank God for total depravity; shower
your honors upon hypocrites, and silence every minister who is touched
with that heresy called genius.Turn out the
astronomers, the geologists, the naturalists, the chemists, and all the
honest scientists.With a whip of scorpions, drive them all out.Nature the True Bible

The true Bible appeals to man in the name of demonstration.It has no fear of being read, of being contradicted,
of being investigated and understood.It does not pretend to be holy, or
sacred; it simply claims to be true.It challenges the scrutiny of
all, and implores every reader to verify every line for himself.It is
incapable of being blasphemed.This book appeals to all the surroundings
of man.Each thing that exists testifies of its perfection.The earth,
with its heart of fire and crowns of snow; with its forests and plains,
its rocks and seas; with its every wave and cloud; with its every leaf
and bud and flower, confirms its every word, and the solemn stars,
shining in the infinite abysses, are the eternal witnesses of its truth.Inspiration

I will tell you what I mean by inspiration.I go and look at the sea,
and the sea says something to me; it makes an impression upon my mind.That impression depends, first, upon my experience; secondly, upon
my intellectual capacity.He has a
different brain, he has had a different experience, he has different
memories and different hopes.The sea may speak to him of joy and to me
of grief and sorrow.The sea cannot tell the same thing to two beings,
because no two human beings have had the same experience.So, when I
look upon a flower, or a star, or a painting, or a statue, the more I
know about sculpture the more that statue speaks to me.The more I have
had of human experience, the more I have read, the greater brain I have,
the more the star says to me.In other words, nature says to me all that
I am capable of understanding.Think of a God wicked and malicious enough to inspire this prayer in
the 109th Psalm.Had this
inspired psalm been found in some temple erected for the worship of
snakes, or in the possession of some cannibal king, written with blood
upon the dried skins of babes, there would have been a perfect harmony
between its surroundings and its sentiments.I Don't Believe the Bible

Now, I read the Bible, and I find that God so loved this world that he
made up his mind to damn the most of us.I have read this book, and what
shall I say of it?I believe it is generally better to be honest.Now,
I don't believe the Bible.They say that if you
do you will regret it when you come to die.If that be true, I know a
great many religious people who will have no cause to regret it--they
don't tell their honest convictions about the Bible.The Bible the Real Persecutor

The Bible was the real persecutor.The Bible burned heretics, built
dungeons, founded the Inquisition, and trampled upon all the liberties
of men.How long, O how long will mankind worship a book?How long will
they grovel in the dust before the ignorant legends of the barbaric
past?How long, O how long will they pursue phantoms in a darkness
deeper than death?Immoralities of the Bible

The believers in the Bible are loud in their denunciation of what they
are pleased to call the immoral literature of the world; and yet few
books have been published containing more moral filth than this inspired
word of God.These stories are not redeemed by a single flash of wit or
humor.They never rise above the dull details of stupid vice.For one,
I cannot afford to soil my pages with extracts from them; and all such
portions of the Scriptures I leave to be examined, written upon, and
explained by the clergy.Clergymen may know some way by which they can
extract honey from these flowers.Until these passages are expunged from
the Old Testament, it is not a fit book to be read by either old or
young.It contains pages that no minister in the United States would
read to his congregation for any reward whatever.There are chapters
that no gentleman would read in the presence of a lady.There are
chapters that no father would read to his child.There are narratives
utterly unfit to be told; and the time will come when mankind will
wonder that such a book was ever called inspired.The Bible Stands in the Way

But as long as the Bible is considered as the work of God, it will be
hard to make all men too good and pure to imitate it; and as long as it
is imitated there will be vile and filthy books.The literature of
our country will not be sweet and clean until the Bible ceases to be
regarded as the production of a god.The Bible False

In the days of Thomas Paine the Church believed and taught that every
word in the Bible was absolutely true.Since his day it has been proven
false in its cosmogony, false in its astronomy, false in its chronology,
false in its history, and so far as the Old Testament is concerned,
false in almost everything.There are but few, if any, scientific men
who apprehend that the Bible is literally true.Who on earth at this
day would pretend to settle any scientific question by a text from
the Bible?The old belief is confined to the ignorant and zealous.The Church itself will before long be driven to occupy the position of
Thomas Paine.The Man I Love

I love any man who gave me, or helped to give me, the liberty I enjoy
to-night.I love every man who helped put our flag in heaven.I love
every man who has lifted his voice in all the ages for liberty, for a
chainless body, and a fetterless brain.I love every man who has given
to every other human being every right that he claimed for himself.I
love every man who thought more of principle than he did of position.I
love the men who have trampled crowns beneath their feet that they might
do something for mankind.Whale, Jonah and All

The best minds of the orthodox world, to-day, are endeavoring to prove
the existence of a personal Deity.You are no longer asked to swallow the Bible whole, whale,
Jonah and all; you are simply required to believe in God, and pay your
pew-rent.There is not now an enlightened minister in the world who will
seriously contend that Samson's strength was in his hair, or that the
necromancers of Egypt could turn water into blood, and pieces of wood
into serpents.Damned for Laughing at Samson

For my part, I would infinitely prefer to know all the results of
scientific investigation, than to be inspired as Moses was.Supposing
the Bible to be true; why is it any worse or more wicked for free
thinkers to deny it, than for priests to deny the doctrine of Evolution,
or the dynamic theory of heat?Why should we be damned for laughing at
Samson and his foxes, while others, holding the Nebular Hypothesis in
utter contempt, go straight to heaven?The Man, Not the Book, Inspired

Now when I come to a book, for instance I read the writings of
Shakespeare--Shakespeare, the greatest human being who ever existed upon
this globe.All that I have sense enough to
understand.Let another read him who knows
nothing of the drama, who knows nothing of the impersonation of passion;
what does he get from him?In other words, every man gets
from a book, a flower, a star, or the sea, what he is able to get from
his intellectual development and experience.Do you then believe that
the Bible is a different book to every human being that receives it?Can God, then, through the Bible, make the same revelation to two
men?Because the man who reads is the man who inspires.Inspiration is in the man and not in the book.The Bible a Chain

The real oppressor, enslaver and corrupter of the people is the Bible.That book is the chain that binds, the dungeon that holds the clergy.That book spreads the pall of superstition over the colleges and
schools.That book puts out the eyes of science, and makes honest
investigation a crime.That book unmans the politician and degrades the
people.That book fills the world with bigotry, hypocrisy and fear.Absurd and Foolish Fables

Volumes might be written upon the infinite absurdity of this most
incredible, wicked and foolish of all the fables contained in that
repository of the impossible, called the Bible.To me it is a matter
of amazement, that it ever was for a moment believed by any intelligent
human being.The Bible the Work of Man

Is it not infinitely more reasonable to say that this book is the work
of man, that it is filled with mingled truth and error, with mistakes
and facts, and reflects, too faithfully perhaps, the "very form and
pressure of its time?"If there are mistakes in the Bible, certainly
they were made by man.If there is anything contrary to nature, it
was written by man.If there is anything immoral, cruel, heartless
or infamous, it certainly was never written by a being worthy of the
adoration of mankind.Something to Admire, not Laugh at

It strikes me that God might write a book that would not necessarily
excite the laughter of his children.In fact, I think it would be
safe to say that a real God could produce a work that would excite the
admiration of mankind.An Intellectual Deformity

The man who now regards the Old Testament as, in any sense, a sacred or
inspired book, is, in my judgment, an intellectual and moral deformity.There is in it so much that is cruel, ignorant, and ferocious, that it
is to me a matter of amazement that it was ever thought to be the work
of a most merciful Deity.The Bible a Poor Product

Admitting that the Bible is the Book of God, is that his only good job?Will not a man be damned as quick for denying the equator as denying
the Bible?Will he not be damned as quick for denying geology as for
denying the scheme of salvation?When the Bible was first written it was
not believed.Had they known as much about science as we know now, that
Bible would not have been written.The Bible the Battle Ground of Sects

Every sect is a certificate that God has not plainly revealed his will
to man.To each reader the Bible conveys a different meaning.About the
meaning of this book, called a revelation, there have been ages of war,
and centuries of sword and flame.If written by an infinite God, he must
have known that these results must follow; and thus knowing, he must be
responsible for all.The Bible Childish

Paine thought the barbarities of the Old Testament inconsistent with
what he deemed the real character of God.He believed that murder,
massacre and indiscriminate slaughter had never been commanded by
the Deity.He regarded much of the Bible as childish, unimportant
and foolish.Paine
attacked the Bible precisely in the same spirit in which he had attacked
the pretensions of kings.All the pomp in the
world could not make him cower.His reason knew no "Holy of Holies,"
except the abode of Truth.Where Moses got the Pentateuch

Nothing can be clearer than that Moses received from the Egyptians the
principal parts of his narrative, making such changes and additions as
were necessary to satisfy the peculiar superstitions of his own people.God's Letter to His Children

According to the theologians, God, the Father of us all, wrote a letter
to his children.The children have always differed somewhat as to the
meaning of this letter.In consequence of these honest differences,
these brothers began to cut out each other's hearts.In every land,
where this letter from God has been read, the children to whom and for
whom it was written have been filled with hatred and malice.They have
imprisoned and murdered each other, and the wives and children of each
other.In the name of God every possible crime has been committed, every
conceivable outrage has been perpetrated.Brave men, tender and loving
women, beautiful girls, and prattling babes have been exterminated in
the name of Jesus Christ.Examination a Crime

The Church has burned honesty and rewarded hypocrisy.And all this,
because it was commanded by a book--a book that men had been taught
implicitly to believe, long before they knew one word that was in it.They had been taught that to doubt the truth of this book--to examine
it, even--was a crime of such enormity that it could not be forgiven,
either in this world or in the next.All that is necessary, as it seems to me, to convince any reasonable
person that the Bible is simply and purely of human invention--of
barbarian invention--is to read it.Read it as you would any other book;
think of it as you would any other; get the bandage of reverence from
your eyes; drive from your heart the phantom of fear; push from the
throne of your brain the cowled form of superstition--then read the Holy
Bible, and you will be amazed that you ever, for one moment, supposed a
being of infinite wisdom, goodness and purity, to be the author of such
ignorance and such atrocity.An Infallible Book Makes Slaves

Whether the Bible is false or true, is of no consequence in comparison
with the mental freedom of the race.Salvation from slavery is inestimable.As long as man
believes the Bible to be infallible, that book is his master.The
civilization of this century is not the child of faith, but of
unbelief--the result of free thought.Can a Sane Man Believe in Inspiration?What man who ever thinks, can believe that blood can appease God?And
yet our entire system of religion is based on that belief.The Jews
pacified Jehovah with the blood of animals, and according to the
Christian system, the blood of Jesus softened the heart of God a little,
and rendered possible the salvation of a fortunate few.It is hard to
conceive how any sane man can read the Bible and still believe in the
doctrine of inspiration.An Inspiration Test

The Bible was originally written in the Hebrew language, and the Hebrew
language at that time had no vowels in writing.It was written entirely
with consonants, and without being divided into chapters and verses, and
there was no system of punctuation whatever.After you go home to-night
write an English sentence or two with only consonants close together,
and you will find that it will take twice as much inspiration to read it
as it did to write it.The Real Bible

The real Bible is not the work of inspired men, nor prophets, nor
evangelists, nor of Christs.The real Bible has not yet been written,
but is being written.Every man who finds a fact adds a word to this
great book.The Bad Passages in the Bible not Inspired

The bad passages in the Bible are not inspired.No God ever upheld
human slavery, polygamy or a war of extermination.No God ever ordered
a soldier to sheathe his sword in the breast of a mother.No God ever
ordered a warrior to butcher a smiling, prattling babe.No God ever said, be subject to the powers that be.No
God ever endeavored to make man a slave and woman a beast of burden.There are thousands of good passages in the Bible.There are in it wise laws, good customs, some lofty and splendid things.And I do not care whether they are inspired or not, so they are true.But what I do insist upon is that the bad is not inspired.Too much Pictorial

There is no hope for you.It is just as bad to deny hell as it is to
deny heaven.The Garden of Eden is pictorial; a pictorial snake and
a pictorial woman, I suppose, and a pictorial man, and may be it was a
pictorial sin.One Plow worth a Million Sermons

Man must learn to rely upon himself.Reading Bibles will not protect
him from the blasts of winter, but houses, fire and clothing will.To
prevent famine one plow is worth a million sermons, and even patent
medicines will cure more diseases than all the prayers uttered since the
beginning of the world.The Infidels of 1776

By the efforts of these infidels--Paine, Jefferson and Franklin--the
name of God was left out of the Constitution of the United States.They
knew that if an infinite being was put in, no room would be left for the
people.They knew that if any church was made the mistress of the state,
that mistress, like all others, would corrupt, weaken, and destroy.Washington wished a church, established by law, in Virginia.He was
prevented by Thomas Jefferson.It was only a little while ago that
people were compelled to attend church by law in the Eastern States,
and taxes were raised for the support of churches the same as for the
construction of highways and bridges.The great principle enunciated
in the Constitution has silently repealed most of these laws.In the
presence of this great instrument the constitutions of the States grew
small and mean, and in a few years every law that puts a chain upon the
mind, except in Delaware, will be repealed, and for these our children
may thank the infidels of 1776.The Legitimate Influence of Religion

Religion should have the influence upon mankind that its goodness, that
its morality, its justice, its charity, its reason and its argument give
it, and no more.Religion should have the effect upon mankind that it
necessarily has, and no more.Infidels the Flowers of the World

The infidels have been the brave and thoughtful men; the flower of all
the world; the pioneers and heralds of the blessed day of liberty and
love; the generous spirits of the unworthy past; the seers and
prophets of our race; the great chivalric souls, proud victors on the
battle-fields of thought, the creditors of all the years to be.The Noblest Sons of, Earth

Who at the present day can imagine the courage, the devotion to
principle, the intellectual and moral grandeur it once required to be an
infidel, to brave the Church, her racks, her fagots, her dungeons, her
tongues of fire--to defy and scorn her heaven and her hell--her devil
and her God?They were the noblest sons of earth.They were the real
saviors of our race, the destroyers of superstition, and the creators
of Science.They were the real Titans who bared their grand foreheads to
all the thunderbolts of all the gods.How Ingersoll became an Infidel

I may say right here that the Christian idea that any God can make me
His friend by killing mine is about as great a mistake as could be made.They seem to have the idea that just as soon as God kills all the people
that a person loves, he will then begin to love the Lord.What drew
my attention first to these questions was the doctrine of eternal
punishment.This was so abhorrent to my mind that I began to hate the
book in which it was taught.Then, in reading law, going back to find
the origin of laws, I found one had to go but a little way before the
legislator and priest united.This led me to study a good many of the
religions of the world.At first I was greatly astonished to find most
of them better than ours.I then studied our own system to the best of
my ability, and found that people were palming off upon children
and upon one another as the inspired words of God a book that upheld
slavery, polygamy, and almost every other crime.Whether I am right or
wrong, I became convinced that the Bible is not an inspired book, and
then the only question for me to settle was as to whether I should say
what I believed or not.This realty was not the question in my mind,
because, before even thinking of such a question, I expressed my belief,
and I simply claim that right, and expect to exercise it as long as I
live.I may be damned for it in the next world, but it is a great source
of pleasure to me in this.Why should it be taken for granted that the men who devoted their lives
to the liberation of their fellowmen should have been hissed at in
the hour of death by the snakes of conscience, while men who defended
slavery--practiced polygamy--justified the stealing of babes from the
breasts of mothers, and lashed the naked back of unpaid labor, are
supposed to have passed smilingly from earth to the embraces of the
angels?Why should we think that the brave thinkers, the investigators,
the honest men must have left the crumbling shore of time in dread and
fear, while the instigators of the massacre of St.Bartholomew, the
inventors and users of thumb screws, of iron boots and racks, the
burners and tearers of human flesh, the stealers, the whippers, and the
enslavers of men, the buyers and beaters of maidens, mothers, and babes,
the founders of the inquisition, the makers of chains, the builders of
dungeons, the calumniators of the living, the slanderers of the
dead, and even the murderers of Jesus Christ, all died in the odor of
sanctity, with white, forgiven hands folded upon the breasts of peace,
while the destroyers of prejudice, the breakers of fetters, the creators
of light, died surrounded by the fierce fiends of God?Infidelity is Liberty

Infidelity is liberty; all religion is slavery.In every creed man is
the slave of God--woman is the slave of man and the sweet children are
the slaves of all.We do not want creeds; we want knowledge--we want
happiness.The World in Debt to Infidels

What would the world be if infidels had never been?Did all the priests of Rome increase the mental wealth of man as much
as Bruno?Did all the priests of France do as great a work for the
civilization of the world as Diderot and Voltaire?Did all the ministers
of Scotland add as much to the sum of human knowledge as David Hume?Have all the clergymen, monks, friars, ministers, priests, bishops,
cardinals, and popes, from the day of Pentecost to the last election,
done as much for human liberty as Thomas Paine?Infidels the Pioneers of Progress

The history of intellectual progress is written in the lives of
infidels.Political rights have been preserved by traitors--the liberty
of the mind by heretics.To attack the king was treason--to dispute the
priest was blasphemy.The throne and the altar were twins--vultures from the same
egg.It was James I. who said: "No bishop, no king."He might have said:
"No cross, no crown."The king owned the bodies, and the priest the
souls, of men.One lived on taxes, the other on alms.One was a robber,
the other a beggar.The king made laws, the priest made creeds.With bowed backs the people
received the burdens of the one, and, with wonder's open mouth, the
dogmas of the other.If any aspired to be free, they were slaughtered by
the king, and every priest was a Herod who slaughtered the children
of the brain.The king ruled by force, the priest by fear, and both by
both.The king said to the people: "God made you peasants, and He made
me king.He made rags and hovels for you, robes and palaces for me.And the priest said: "God made you ignorant and
vile.If you do not obey me, God will punish
you here and torment you hereafter.Infidels the Great Discoverers

Infidels are the intellectual discoverers.They sail the unknown seas,
and in the realms of thought they touch the shores of other worlds.An
infidel is the finder of a new fact--one who in the mental sky has seen
another star.He is an intellectual capitalist, and for that reason
excites the envy of theological paupers.The Altar of Reason

Virtue is a subordination, of the passions to the intellect.It is to
act in accordance with your highest convictions.It does not consist in
believing, but in doing.This is the sublime truth that the Infidels in
all ages have uttered.They have handed the torch from one to the other
through all the years that have fled.Upon the altar of reason they have
kept the sacred fire, and through the long midnight of faith they fed
the divine flame.GODS AND DEVILS




275.Every Nation has Created a God

Each nation has created a God, and the God has always resembled his
creators.He hated and loved what they hated and loved.Each God was
intensely patriotic, and detested all nations but his own.All these
gods demanded praise, flattery and worship.Most of them were pleased
with sacrifice, and the smell of innocent blood has ever been considered
a divine perfume.All these gods have insisted on having a vast number
of priests, and the priests have always insisted upon being supported
by the people; and the principle business of these priests has been
to boast that their God could easily vanquish all the other gods put
together.Gods with Back-Hair

Man, having always been the physical superior of woman, accounts for
the fact that most of the high gods have been males.Had women been the
physical superior; the powers supposed to be the rulers of Nature would
have been woman, and instead of being represented in the apparel of man,
they would have luxuriated in trains, low-necked dresses, laces and
back-hair.Creation the Decomposition of the Infinite

Admitting that a god did create the universe, the question then arises,
of what did he create it?Nothing,
considered in the light of a raw material, is a most decided failure.It
follows, then, that the god must have made the universe out of himself,
he being the only existence.The universe is material, and if it was
made of god, the god must have been material.With this very thought in
his mind, Anaximander of Miletus, said: "Creation is the decomposition
of the infinite."The Gods Are as the People Are

No god was ever in advance of the nation that created him.The <DW64>s
represented their deities with black skins and curly hair: The Mongolian
gave to his a yellow complexion and dark almond-shaped eyes.The Jews
were not allowed to paint theirs, or we should have seen Jehovah with
a full beard, an oval face, and an aquiline nose.Zeus was a perfect
Greek, and Jove looked as though a member of the Roman senate.The gods
of Egypt had the patient face and placid look of the loving people who
made them.The gods of northern countries were represented warmly clad
in robes of fur; those of the tropics were naked.The gods of India
were often mounted upon elephants; those of some islanders were great
swimmers, and the deities of the Arctic zone were passionately fond of
whale's blubber.Gods Shouldn't Make Mistakes

Generally the devotee has modeled them after himself, and has given them
hands, heads, feet, eyes, ears, and organs of speech.Each nation made
its gods and devils not only speak its language, but put in their mouths
the same mistakes in history, geography, astronomy, and in all matters
of fact, generally made by the people.Miracles

No one, in the world's whole history, ever attempted to substantiate a
truth by a miracle.Nothing but
falsehood ever attested itself by signs and wonders.No miracle ever was
performed, and no sane man ever thought he had performed one, and until
one is performed, there can be no evidence of the existence of any power
superior to, and independent of nature.Plenty of Gods on Hand

Man has never been at a loss for gods.He has worshipped almost
everything, including the vilest and most disgusting beasts.He has
worshipped fire, earth, air, water, light, stars, and for hundreds, of
ages prostrated himself before enormous snakes.Savage tribes often make
gods of articles they get from civilized people.The Todas worship
a cowbell.The Kodas worship two silver plates, which they regard as
husband and wife, and another tribe manufactured a god out of a king of
hearts.The Devil Difficulty

In the olden times the existence of devils was universally admitted.The
people had no doubt upon that subject, and from such belief it followed
as a matter of course, that a person, in order to vanquish these devils,
had either to be a god, or to be assisted by one.All founders of
religions have established their claims to divine origin by controlling
evil spirits, and suspending the laws of nature.Casting out devils was
a certificate of divinity.A prophet, unable to cope with the powers of
darkness, was regarded with contempt.The utterance of the highest and
noblest sentiments, the most blameless and holy life, commanded but
little respect, unless accompanied by power to work miracles and command
spirits.If he was God, of course
the devil knew that fact, and yet, according to this account, the devil
took the omnipotent God and placed him upon a pinnacle of the temple,
and endeavored to induce him, to dash himself against the earth.Failing
in that, he took the creator, owner and governor of the universe up into
an exceeding high mountain, and offered him this world--this grain of
sand--if he, the God of all the worlds, would fall down and worship
him, a poor devil, without even a tax title to one foot of dirt!Is it
possible the devil was such an idiot?Should any great credit be given
to this deity for not being caught with such chaff?The
devil--the prince of sharpers--the king of cunning--the master of
finesse, trying to bribe God with a grain of sand that belonged to God!Industrious Deities

Few nations have been so poor as to have but one god.Gods were made
so easily, and the raw material cost so little, that generally the god
market was fairly glutted, and heaven crammed with these phantoms.These
gods not only attended to the skies, but were supposed to interfere in
all the affairs of men.All was supposed to be under their
immediate control.Nothing was too small--nothing too large; the falling
of sparrows and the motions of the planets were alike attended to by
these industrious and observing deities.God in Idleness

If a god created the universe, then, there must have been a time when he
commenced to create.Back of that time there must have been an eternity,
during which there had existed nothing--absolutely nothing--except this
supposed god.According to this theory, this god spent an eternity, so
to speak, in an infinite vacuum, and in perfect idleness.Fancy a Devil Drowning a World

One of these gods, according to the account, drowned an entire world,
with the exception of eight persons.The old, the young, the beautiful
and the helpless were remorselessly devoured by the shoreless sea.This,
the most fearful tragedy that the imagination of ignorant priests ever
conceived, was the act, not of a devil, but of a god, so-called, whom
men ignorantly worship unto this day.What a stain such an act would
leave upon the character of a devil!Some Gods Very Particular About Little Things

From their starry thrones they frequently came to the earth for the
purpose of imparting information to man.It is related of one that he
came amid thunderings and lightnings in order to tell the people that
they should not cook a kid in its mother's milk.Some left their shining
abodes to tell women that they should, or should not, have children, to
inform a priest how to cut and wear his apron, and to give directions as
to the proper manner of cleaning the intestines of a bird.288 The Gods of To-day the Scorn of To-morrow

Nations, like individuals, have their periods of youth, of manhood and
decay.The same inexorable destiny awaits them
all.The gods created by the nations must perish with their creators.They were created by men, and like men, they must pass away.The deities
of one age are the by-words of the next.No Evidence of a God in Nature

The best minds, even in the religious world, admit that in the material
nature there is no evidence of what they are pleased to call a god.They find their evidence in the phenomena of intelligence, and very
innocently assert that intelligence is above, and in fact, opposed to
nature.They insist that man, at least, is a special creation; that
he has somewhere in his brain a divine spark, a little portion of the
"Great First Cause."They say that matter cannot produce thought; but
that thought can produce matter.They tell us that man has intelligence,
and therefore there must be an intelligence greater than his.Why not
say, God has intelligence, therefore there must be an intelligence
greater than his?So far as we know, there is no intelligence apart
from matter.We cannot conceive of thought, except as produced within a
brain.Great Variety in Gods

Gods have been manufactured after numberless models., and according to
the most grotesque fashions.Some have a thousand arms, some a hundred
heads, some are adorned with necklaces of living snakes, some are armed
with clubs, some with sword and shield, some with bucklers, and some
have wings as a cherub; some were invisible, some would show themselves
entire, and some would only show their backs; some were jealous, some
were foolish, some turned themselves into men, some into swans, some
into bulls, some into doves, and some into Holy-Ghosts, and made love
to the beautiful daughters of men: Some were married--all ought to have
been--and some were considered as old bachelors from all eternity.Some
had children, and the children were turned into gods and worshiped as
their fathers had been.Most of these gods were revengeful, savage,
lustful, and ignorant.As they generally depended upon their priests for
information, their ignorance can hardly excite our astonishment.God Grows Smaller

"But," says the religionist, "you cannot explain everything; and that
which you cannot explain, that which you do not comprehend, is my God."We are understanding more every day;
consequently your God is growing smaller every day.Give the Devil His Due

If the account given in Genesis is really true, ought we not, after all,
to thank this serpent?He was the first schoolmaster, the first advocate
of learning, the first enemy of ignorance, the first to whisper in human
ears the sacred word liberty, the creator of ambition, the author of
modesty, of inquiry, of doubt, of investigation, of progress and of
civilization.Casting out Devils

Even Christ, the supposed son of God, taught that persons were possessed
of evil spirits, and frequently, according to the account, gave proof of
his divine origin and mission by frightening droves of devils out of his
unfortunate countrymen.Casting out devils was his principal employment,
and the devils thus banished generally took occasion to acknowledge him
as the true Messiah; which was not only very kind of them, but quite
fortunate for him.On the Horns of a Dilemma

The history of religion is simply the story of man's efforts in all ages
to avoid one of two great powers, and to pacify the other.Both powers
have inspired little else than abject fear.The cold, calculating sneer
of the devil, and the frown of God, were equally terrible.In any event,
man's fate was to be arbitrarily fixed forever by an unknown power
superior to all law, and to all fact.The Devil and the Swine

How are you going to prove a miracle?How would you go to work to prove
that the devil entered into a drove of swine?Who saw it, and who would
know a devil if he did see him?Some tell me that it is the desire of God that I should worship Him?If he is in want and I can assist Him and will
not, I would be an ingrate and an infamous wretch.But I am satisfied
that I cannot by any possibility assist the infinite.I can help feed the hungry, clothe the naked, enlighten
ignorance.I can help at least, in some degree, toward covering this
world with a mantle of joy I may be wrong, but I do not believe that
there is any being in this universe who gives rain for praise, who gives
sunshine for prayer, or who blesses a man simply because he kneels.If the infinite "Father" allows a majority of his children to live in
ignorance and wretchedness now, what evidence is there that he will ever
improve their condition?Can the conduct
of infinite wisdom, power and love ever change?Is the infinite capable
of any improvement whatever?According to the theologians, God prepared this globe expressly for the
habitation of his loved children, and yet he filled the forests with
ferocious beasts; placed serpents in every path; stuffed the world
with earthquakes, and adorned its surface with mountains of flame.Notwithstanding all this, we are told that the world is perfect; that
it was created by a perfect being, and is therefore necessarily perfect.The next moment, these same persons will tell us that the world was
cursed; covered with brambles, thistles and thorns, and that man was
doomed to disease and death, simply because our poor, dear mother ate an
apple contrary to the command of an arbitrary God.The Devils better than the Gods

Our ancestors not only had their God-factories, but they made devils
as well.These devils were generally disgraced and fallen gods.These
devils generally sympathized with man.In nearly all the theologies,
mythologies and religions, the devils have been much more humane and
merciful than the gods.No devil ever gave one of his generals an order
to kill children and to rip open the bodies of pregnant women.Such
barbarities were always ordered by the good gods!The pestilences were
sent by the most merciful gods!The frightful famine, during which the
dying child with pallid lips sucked the withered bosom of a dead
mother, was sent by the loving gods.No devil was ever charged with such
fiendish brutality.Is it possible that an infinite God created this world simply to be the
dwelling-place of slaves and serfs?simply for the purpose of raising
orthodox Christians?That he did a few miracles to astonish them; that
all the evils of life are simply his punishments, and that he is finally
going to turn heaven into a kind of religious museum filled with Baptist
barnacles, petrified Presbyterians and Methodist mummies?I want no
heaven for which I must give my reason; no happiness in exchange for
my liberty, and no immortality that demands the surrender of my
individuality.Better rot in the windowless tomb, to which there is no
door but the red mouth of the pallid worm, than wear the jeweled collar
even of a god.It is impossible to conceive of a more thoroughly despicable, hateful,
and arrogant being, than the Jewish god.In the mythology of the world he has no parallel.He, only, is
never touched by agony and tears.He cares neither for love nor music,
beauty nor joy.A false friend, an unjust judge, a braggart, hypocrite,
and tyrant.Compared with Jehovah, Pharaoh was a benefactor, and the
tyranny of Egypt was freedom to those who suffered the liberty of God.HEAVEN AND HELL




302.Hope of a Future Life

For my part I know nothing of any other state of existence, either
before or after this, and I have never become personally acquainted with
anybody who did.There may be another life, and if there is the best
way to prepare for it is by making somebody happy in this.God certainly
cannot afford to put a man in hell who has made a little heaven in this
world.I would like to see how things come
out in this world when I am dead.There are some people I should like to
see again, but if there is no other life I shall never know it.I am Immortal

So far as I am concerned I am immortal; that is to say, I can't
recollect when I did not exist, and there never will be a time when I
will remember that I do not exist.I would like to have several millions
of dollars, and I may say I have a lively hope that some day I may be
rich; but to tell you the truth I have very little evidence of it.Our
hope of immortality does not come from any religions, but nearly all
religions come from that hope.The Old Testament, instead of telling
us that we are immortal, tells us how we lost immortality.You will
recollect that if Adam and Eve could have gotten to the tree of life,
they would have eaten of its fruit and would have lived forever; but for
the purpose of preventing immortality God turned them out of the Garden
of Eden, and put certain angels with swords or sabres at the gate to
keep them from getting back.The Old Testament proves, if it proves
anything, which I do not think it does, that there is no life after
this; and the New Testament is not very specific on the subject.There
were a great many opportunities for the Savior and his apostles to
tell us about another world, but they didn't improve them to any great
extent; and the only evidence so far as I know about another life is,
first, that we have no evidence; and, secondly, that we are rather sorry
that we have not, and wish we had.And suppose, after all, that death does end all.Next to eternal joy,
next to being forever with those we love and those who have loved us,
next to that is to be wrapped in the dreamless drapery of eternal peace.Upon the shadowy shore of death
the sea of trouble casts no wave.Eyes that have been curtained by the
everlasting dark will never know again the touch of tears.Lips that
have been touched by the eternal silence will never utter another word
of grief.And I had
rather think of those I have loved, and those I have lost, as having
returned to earth, as having become a part of the elemental wealth of
the the world.I would rather think of them as unconscious dust.I would
rather think of them as gurgling in the stream, floating in the cloud,
bursting into light upon the shores of worlds.I would rather think
of them thus than to have even a suspicion that their souls had been
clutched by an orthodox God.The Old World Ignorant of Destiny

Moses differed from most of the makers of sacred books by his failure
to say anything of a future life, by failing to promise heaven, and to
threaten hell.Upon the subject of a future state, there is not one
word in the Pentateuch.Probably at that early day God did not deem
it important to make a revelation as to the eternal destiny of man.He seems to have thought that he could control the Jews, at least, by
rewards and punishments in this world, and so he kept the frightful
realities of eternal joy and torment a profound secret from the people
of his choice.He thought it far more important to tell the Jews their
origin than to enlighten them as to their destiny.Where the Doctrine of Hell was born

I honestly believe that the doctrine of hell was born in the glittering
eyes of snakes that run in frightful coils watching for their prey.I
believe it was born in the yelping and howling and growling and snarling
of wild beasts.I believe it was born in the grin of hyenas and in the
malicious clatter of depraved apes.I despise it, I defy it, and I hate
it; and when the great ship freighted with the world goes down in
the night of death, chaos and disaster, I will not be guilty of the
ineffable meanness of pushing from my breast my wife and children and
paddling off in some orthodox canoe.I will go down with those I love
and with those who love me.I will go down with the ship and with my
race.Nothing can make me believe that there is any being that is going to
burn and torment and damn his children forever.The Grand Companionships of Hell

Since hanging has got to be a means of grace, I would prefer hell.I had
a thousand times rather associate with the pagan philosophers than with
the inquisitors of the middle ages.I certainly should prefer the worst
man in Greek or Roman history to John Calvin, and I can imagine no man
in the world that I would not rather sit on the same bench with than the
puritan fathers and the founders of orthodox churches.I would trade off
my harp any minute for a seat in the other country.All the poets will
be in perdition, and the greatest thinkers, and, I should think, most
of the women whose society would tend to increase the happiness of
man, nearly all the painters, nearly all the sculptors, nearly all
the writers of plays, nearly all the great actors, most of the best
musicians, and nearly all the good fellows--the persons who know good
stories, who can sing songs, or who will loan a friend a dollar.They will mostly all be in that country, and if I did not live there
permanently, I certainly would want it so I could spend my winter months
there.Let me put one case and I will be through with this branch of the
subject.The husband is a good
fellow and the wife a splendid woman.They live and love each other and
all at once he is taken sick, and they watch day after day and night
after night around his bedside until their property is wasted and
finally she has to go to work, and she works through eyes blinded with
tears, and the sentinel of love watches at the bedside of her prince,
and at the least breath or the least motion she is awake; and she
attends him night after night and day after day for years, and finally
he dies, and she has him in her arms and covers his wasted face with the
tears of agony and love.He dies, and
she buries him and puts flowers above his grave, and she goes there in
the twilight of evening and she takes her children, and tells her little
boys and girls through her tears how brave and how true and how tender
their father was, and finally she dies and goes to hell, because she was
not a believer; and he goes to the battlements of heaven and looks over
and sees the woman who loved him with all the wealth of her love, and
whose tears made his dead face holy and sacred, and he looks upon her
in the agonies of hell without having his happiness diminished in the
least.With all due respect to everybody I say, damn any such doctrine
as that.The Drama of Damnation

When you come to die, as you look back upon the record of your life, no
matter how many men you have wrecked and ruined, and no matter how many
women you have deceived and deserted--all that may be forgiven you;
but if you recollect that you have laughed at God's book you will see
through the shadows of death, the leering looks of fiends and the forked
tongues of devils.For instance, it
is the day of judgment.When the man is called up by the recording
secretary, or whoever does the cross-examining, he says to his soul:
"Where are you from?""Well, I don't like to talk about myself.""Well, I was a good fellow; I loved
my wife; I loved my children.My home was my heaven; my fireside was my
paradise, and to sit there and see the lights and shadows falling on the
faces of those I love, that to me was a perpetual joy.I never gave one
of them a solitary moment of pain.I don't owe a dollar in the world,
and I left enough to pay my funeral expenses and keep the wolf of want
from the door of the house I loved.That is the kind of a man I am."They were always expecting to be happy simply because somebody else was
to be damned.""Well, did you believe that rib story?"To tell you the
God's truth, that was a little more than I could swallow.""Yes, sir, and to the Young Men's Christian
Association.""Did you
ever run off with any of the money?""I don't like to tell, sir.""What kind of a bank did you have?""How much did you
run off with?""Did you take anything
else along with you?""Did you have a wife and children of your own?""Oh, yes; but such was my confidence in God that I
believed he would take care of them."I believed all of it, sir; I often used to be sorry that there were
not harder stories yet in the Bible, so that I could show what my faith
could do."Annihilation rather than be a God

No God has a right to make a man he intends to drown.Eternal wisdom has
no right to make a poor investment, no right to engage in a speculation
that will not finally pay a dividend.No God has a right to make
a failure, and surely a man who is to be damned forever is not a
conspicuous success.Yet upon love's breast, the Church has placed that
asp; around the child of immortality the Church has coiled the worm that
never dies.For my part I want no heaven, if there is to be a hell.I
would rather be annihilated than be a god and know that one human soul
would have to suffer eternal agony."All that have Red Hair shall be Damned."I admit that most Christians are honest--always have admitted it.I
admit that most ministers are honest, and that they are doing the best
they can in their way for the good of mankind; but their doctrines are
hurtful; they do harm in the world; and I am going to do what I can
against their doctrines.They preach this infamy: "He that believes
shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned."Every word
of that text has been an instrument of torture; every letter in that
text has been a sword thrust into the bleeding and quivering heart of
man; every letter has been a dungeon; every line has been a chain; and
that infamous sentence has covered this world with blood.I deny that
"whoso believes shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be
damned."No man can control his belief; you might as well say, "All that
have red hair shall be damned."The Conscience of a Hyena

But, after all, what I really want to do is to destroy the idea of
eternal punishment.That
doctrine fills hell with honest men, and heaven with intellectual and
moral paupers.That doctrine allows people to sin on a credit.That
doctrine allows the basest to be eternally happy and the most honorable
to suffer eternal pain.I think of all doctrines it is the most
infinitely infamous, and would disgrace the lowest savage, and any man
who believes it, and has imagination enough to understand it, has the
heart of a serpent and the conscience of a hyena.I Leave the Dead

But for me I leave the dead where nature leaves them, and whatever
flower of hope springs up in my heart I will cherish.But I cannot
believe that there is any being in this universe who has created a
soul for eternal pain, and I would rather that every God would destroy
himself, I would rather that we all should go back to the eternal chaos,
to the black and starless night, than that just one soul should suffer
eternal agony.Swedenborg did one thing for which I feel almost grateful.He gave an
account of having met John Calvin in hell.Nothing connected with the
supernatural could be more natural than this.The only thing detracting
from the value of this report is, that if there is a hell, we know
without visiting the place that John Calvin must be there.GOVERNING GREAT MEN




315.Jesus Christ

And let me say here once for all, that for the man Christ I have
infinite respect.Let me say once for all that the place where man has
died for man is holy ground.Let me say once for all, to that great and
serene man I gladly pay--I _gladly_ pay the tribute of my admiration and
my tears.He was an infidel in his
time.He was regarded as a blasphemer, and his life was destroyed by
hypocrites who have in all ages done what they could to trample freedom
out of the human mind.Had I lived at that time I would have been his
friend.And should he come again he will not find a better friend than
I will be.For the theological creation I have
a different feeling.If he was in fact God, he knew there was no such
thing as death; he knew that what we call death was but the eternal
opening of the golden gates of everlasting joy.And it took no heroism
to face a death that was simply eternal life.The Emperor Constantine, who lifted Christianity into power, murdered
his wife Fausta and his eldest son Crispus the same year that he
convened the council of Nice to decide whether Jesus Christ was a man or
the son of God.The council decided that Christ was substantial with
the Father.We are thus indebted to a wife
murderer for settling the vexed question of the divinity of the Savior.Theodosius called a council at Constantinople in 381, and this council
decided that the Holy Ghost proceeded from the Father.Theodosius,
the younger, assembled another council at Ephesus to ascertain who the
Virgin Mary really was, and it was solemnly decided in the year 431 that
she was the mother of God.In 451 it was decided by a council held at
Chalcedon, called together by the Emperor Marcian, that Christ had two
natures--the human and divine.In 680, in another general council, held
at Constantinople, convened by order of Pognatius, it was also decided
that Christ had two wills, and in the year 1274 it was decided at the
council of Lyons that the Holy Ghost proceeded not only from the Father,
but from the Son as well.Had it not been for these councils we might
have been without a trinity even unto this day.When we take into
consideration the fact that a belief in the trinity is absolutely
essential to salvation, how unfortunate it was for the world that this
doctrine was not established until the year 1274.Think of the millions
that dropped into hell while these questions were being discussed.The church never has pretended that Jefferson or Franklin died in fear.Franklin wrote no books against the fables of the ancient Jews.He
thought it useless to cast the pearls of thought before the swine of
ignorance and fear.He was the father of a
great party.He gave his views in letters and to trusted friends.He
was a Virginian, author of the Declaration of Independence, founder of a
university, father of a political party, President of the United States,
a statesman and philosopher.He was too powerful for the churches of
his day.Paine was a foreigner, a citizen of the world.He had done these things openly, and what
he had said could not be answered.His arguments were so good that his
character was bad.The Emperor, stained with every crime, is supposed to have died like a
Christian.We hear nothing of fiends leering at him in the shadows of
death.He does not see the forms of his murdered wife and son covered
with the blood he shed.From his white and shriveled lips issued no
shrieks of terror.He does not cover his glazed eyes with thin and
trembling hands to shut out the visions of hell.His chamber is filled
with the rustle of wings waiting to bear his soul to the thrilling
realms of joy.Against the Emperor Constantine the church has hurled no
anathema.She has accepted the story of his vision in the clouds, and
his holy memory has been guarded by priest and pope.Diderot

Diderot was born in 1713.His parents were in what may be called the
humbler walks of life.Like Voltaire, he was educated by the Jesuits.He
had in him something of the vagabond, and was for several years almost a
beggar in Paris.He was endeavoring to live by his pen.In that day and
generation a man without a patron, endeavoring to live by literature,
was necessarily almost a beggar.He nearly starved--frequently going
for days without food.Afterward, when he had something himself, he was
generous as the air.No man ever was more willing to give, and no man
less willing to receive, than Diderot.His motto was, "Incredulity
is the first step toward philosophy."He had the vices of most
Christians--was nearly as immoral as the majority of priests.His vices
he shared in common--his virtues were his own--All who knew him united
in saying that he had the pity of a woman, the generosity of a prince,
the self-denial of an anchorite, the courage of Caesar, an insatiate
thirst foi knowledge, and the enthusiasm of a poet.He attacked with
every power of his mind the superstition of his day.He was in favor of universal
education--the church despised it.He wished to put the knowledge of
the whole world within reach of the poorest.He wished to drive from
the gate of the Garden of Eden the cherubim of superstition, so that
the child of Adam might return to eat once more the fruit of the tree
of knowledge.His poor little desk was
ransacked by the police, searching for manuscripts in which something
might be found that would justify the imprisonment of such a dangerous
man.Whoever, in 1750, wished to increase the knowledge of mankind was
regarded as the enemy of social order.Benedict Spinoza

One of the greatest thinkers of the world was Benedict Spinoza--a Jew,
born at Amsterdam in 1638.He asked the rabbis so many questions, and insisted to such a degree on
what he called reason, that his room was preferred to his company.His Jewish brethren excommunicated him from the synagogue.Under the
terrible curse of their religion he was made an outcast from every
Jewish home.His own father could not give him shelter, and his mother,
after the curse had been pronounced, could not give him bread, could not
even speak to him, without becoming an outcast herself.All the cruelty
of Jehovah was in this curse.Spinoza was but twenty-four years old
when he found himself without friends and without kindred.He earned his bread with willing hands, and cheerfully
divided his poor crust with those below.He tried to solve the problem
of existence.According to him the universe did not commence to
be.It is; from eternity it was; and to eternity it will be.He insisted
that God is inside, not outside, of what we call substance.Thomas Paine

Poverty was his mother--Necessity his master.He had more brains than
books; more sense than education; more courage than politeness;
more strength than polish.He had no veneration for old mistakes--no
admiration for ancient lies.He loved the truth for the truth's
sake, and for man's sake.He saw oppression on every hand; injustice
everywhere; hypocrisy at the altar, venality on the bench, tyranny on
the throne; and with a splendid courage he espoused the cause of the
weak against the strong--of the enslaved many against the titled few.The Greatest of all Political Writers

In my judgment, Thomas Paine was the best political writer that ever
lived."What he wrote was pure nature, and his soul and his pen ever
went together."Ceremony, pageantry, and all the paraphernalia of
power, had no effect upon him.He examined into the why and wherefore of
things.He was perfectly radical in his mode of thought.Nothing short
of the bed-rock satisfied him.His enthusiasm for what he believed to
be right knew no bounds.During all the dark scenes of the Revolution,
never for one moment did he despair.Year after year his brave words
were ringing through the land, and by the bivouac fires the weary
soldiers read the inspiring words of "Common Sense," filled with ideas
sharper than their swords, and consecrated themselves anew to the cause
of Freedom.The Writings of Paine

The writings of Paine are gemmed with compact statements that carry
conviction to the dullest.Day and night he labored for America, until
there was a government of the people and for the people.At the close
of the Revolution no one stood higher than Thomas Paine.Had he been
willing to live a hypocrite, he would have been respectable, he at least
could have died surrounded by other hypocrites, and at his death there
would have been an imposing funeral, with miles of carriages, filled
with hypocrites, and above his hypocritical dust there would have been a
hypocritical monument covered with lies.The truth is, he died as he had lived.Some ministers were impolite
enough to visit him against his will.Several of them he ordered
from his room.A couple of Catholic priests, in all the meekness of
hypocrisy, called that they might enjoy the agonies of a dying friend
of man.Thomas Paine, rising in his bed, the few embers of expiring life
blown into flame by the breath of indignation, had the goodness to curse
them both.His physician, who seems to have been a meddling fool, just
as the cold hand of death was touching the patriot's heart, whispered
in the dull ear of the dying man: "Do you believe, or do you wish to
believe, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?"And the reply was: "I
have no wish to believe on that subject."These were the last remembered
words of Thomas Paine.He died as serenely as ever Christian passed
away.He died in the full possession of his mind, and on the very brink
and edge of death proclaimed the doctrines of his life.Paine Believed in God

Thomas Paine was a champion in both hemispheres of human liberty; one of
the founders and fathers of the Republic; one of the foremost men of his
age.He never wrote a word in favor of injustice.He was a despiser of
slavery.He wast in the widest and
best sense, a friend of all his race.His head was as clear as his heart
was good, and he had the courage to speak his honest thought.He was
the first man to write these words: "The United States of America."He furnished every thought
that now glitters in the Declaration of Independence.He believed in one
God and no more.He was a believer even in special providence, and he
hoped for immortality.The Intellectual Hera

Thomas Paine was one of the intellectual heroes--one of the men to whom
we are indebted.His name is associated forever with the Great Republic.As long as free government exists he will be remembered, admired and
honored.He lived a long, laborious and useful life.The world is better
for his having lived.For the sake of truth he accepted hatred and
reproach for his portion.His friends
were untrue to him because he was true to himself, and true to them.He
lost the respect of what is called society, but kept his own.His life
is what the world calls failure and what history calls success.If to
love your fellow-men more than self is goodness, Thomas Paine was good.If to be in advance of your time--to be a pioneer in the direction of
right--is greatness.If to avow your principles and discharge your
duty in the presence of death is heroic, Thomas Paine was a hero.At the
age of seventy-three, death touched his tired heart.He died in the land
his genius defended--under the flag he gave to the skies.Slander cannot
touch him now--hatred cannot reach him more.He sleeps in the sanctuary
of the tomb, beneath the quiet of the stars.Paine, Franklin, Jefferson

In our country there were three infidels--Paine, Franklin and Jefferson.The colonies were full of superstition, the Puritans with the spirit
of persecution.Laws savage, ignorant, and malignant had been passed in
every colony for the purpose of destroying intellectual liberty.The toleration acts of
Maryland tolerated only Christians--not infidels, not thinkers, not
investigators.The charity of Roger Williams was not extended to those
who denied the Bible, or suspected the divinity of Christ.It was not
based upon the rights of man, but upon the rights of believers, who
differed in non-essential points.David Hume

On the 26th of April, 1711, David Hume was born.David Hume was one of
the few Scotchmen of his day who were not owned by the church.He had
the manliness to examine historical and religious questions for himself,
and the courage to give his conclusions to the world.He was singularly
capable of governing himself.He was a philosopher, and lived a calm
and cheerful life, unstained by an unjust act, free from all excess,
and devoted in a reasonable degree to benefiting his fellow-men.After
examining the Bible he became convinced that it was not true.For
failing to suppress his real opinion, for failing to tell a deliberate
falsehood, he brought upon him the hatred of the church.Voltaire

Voltaire was the intellectual autocrat of his time.From his throne at
the foot of the Alps he pointed the finger of scorn at every hypocrite
in Europe.He left the quiver of ridicule without an arrow.He was the
pioneer of his century.Through the
shadows of faith and fable, through the darkness of myth and miracle,
through the midnight of Christianity, through the blackness of bigotry,
past cathedral and dungeon, past rack and stake, past altar and throne,
he carried, with brave and chivalric hands, the torch of reason.John Calvin

Calvin was of a pallid, bloodless complexion, thin, sickly, irritable,
gloomy, impatient, egotistic, tyrannical, heartless, and infamous.He
was a strange compound of revengeful morality, malicious forgiveness,
ferocious charity, egotistic humility, and a kind of hellish justice.In other words, he was as near like the God of the Old Testament as his
health permitted.Calvin's Five Fetters

This man forged five fetters for the brain.That is to say, predestination, particular redemption, total
depravity, irresistible grace, and the perseverance of the saints.About
the neck of each follower he put a collar bristling with these five iron
points.The presence of all these points on the collar is still the test
of orthodoxy in the church he founded.This man, when in the flush of
youth, was elected to the office of preacher in Geneva.He at once,
in union with Farel, drew up a condensed statement of the Presbyterian
doctrine, and all the citizens of Geneva, on pain of banishment, were
compelled to take an oath that they believed this statement.Of this
proceeding Calvin very innocently remarked that it produced great
satisfaction.A man named Caroli had the audacity to dispute with
Calvin.Humboldt

Humboldt breathed the atmosphere of investigation.Old ideas were
abandoned; old creeds, hallowed by centuries, were thrown aside; thought
became courageous; the athlete, Reason, challenged to mortal combat the
monsters of superstition.Humbolt's Travels

Europe becoming too small for his genius, he visited the tropics.He
sailed along the gigantic Amazon--the mysterious Orinoco--traversed the
Pampas--climbed the Andes until he stood upon the crags of Chimborazo,
more than eighteen thousand feet above the level of the sea, and climbed
on until blood flowed from his eyes and lips.For nearly five years he
pursued his investigations in the new world, accompanied by the intrepid
Bonplandi.He was the best intellectual
organ of these new revelations of science.He was calm, reflective and
eloquent; filled with a sense of the beautiful, and the love of truth.His collections were immense, and valuable beyond calculation to every
science.He endured innumerable hardships, braved countless dangers in
unknown and savage lands, and exhausted his fortune for the advancement
of true learning.Humboldt's Illustrious Companions

Humboldt was the friend and companion of the greatest poets, historians,
philologists, artists, statesmen, critics, and logicians of his time.He was the companion of Schiller, who believed that man would be
regenerated through the influence of the Beautiful of Goethe, the grand
patriarch of German literature; of Weiland, who has been called
the Voltaire of Germany; of Herder, who wrote the outlines of a
philosophical history of man; of Kotzebue, who lived in the world of
romance; of Schleiermacher, the pantheist; of Schlegel, who gave to
his countrymen the enchanted realm of Shakespeare; of the sublime Kant,
author of the first work published in Germany on Pure Reason; of Fichte,
the infinite idealist; of Schopenhauer, the European Buddhist who
followed the great Gautama to the painless and dreamless Nirwana, and
of hundreds of others, whose names are familiar to and honored by the
scientific world.Humboldt the Apostle of Science

Upon his return to Europe he was hailed as the second Columbus; as the
scientific discover of America; as the revealer of a new world; as the
great demonstrator of the sublime truth, that the universe is governed
by law.I have seen a picture of the old man, sitting upon a mountain
side--above him the eternal snow--below, the smiling valley of the
tropics, filled with vine and palm; his chin upon his breast, his
eyes deep, thoughtful and calm his forehead majestic--grander than the
mountain upon which he sat--crowned with the snow of his whitened hair,
he looked the intellectual autocrat of this world.Not satisfied with
his discoveries in America, he crossed the steppes of Asia, the wastes
of

Siberia, the great Ural range adding to the knowledge of mankind at
every step.H is energy acknowledged no obstacle, his life knew no
leisure; every day was filled with labor and with thought.He was one
of the apostles of science, and he served his divine master with
a self-sacrificing zeal that knew no abatement; with an ardor that
constantly increased, and with a devotion unwavering and constant as the
polar star.Ingersoll Muses by Napoleon's Tomb

A little while ago I stood by the grave of the old Napoleon--a
magnificent tomb of gilt and gold, fit almost for a dead deity--and
gazed upon the sarcophagus of black Egyptian marble, where rest at last
the ashes of the restless man.I leaned over the balustrade and thought
about the career of the greatest soldier of the modern world.I saw him
walking upon the banks of the Seine, contemplating suicide--I saw him
at Toulon--I saw him putting down the mob in the streets of Paris--I saw
him at the head of the army of Italy--I saw him crossing the bridge of
Lodi with the tri-color in his hand--I saw him in Egypt in the shadows
of the pyramids--I saw him conquer the Alps and mingle the eagles of
France with the eagles of the crags.I saw him at Marengo--at Ulm and
Austerlitz.I saw him in Russia, where the infantry of the snow and the
cavalry of the wild blast scattered his legions like Winter's withered
leaves.I saw him at Leipsic in defeat and disaster--driven by a million
bayonets back upon Paris--clutched like a wild beast--banished to Elba.I saw him escape and retake an empire by the force of his genius.I saw
him upon the frightful field of Waterloo, where chance and fate combined
to wreck the fortunes of their former king.Helena,
with his hands crossed behind him, gazing out upon the sad and solemn
sea.I thought of the orphans and widows he had made--of the tears that
had been shed for his glory, and of the only woman who ever loved him,
pushed from his heart by the cold hand of ambition.And I said I would
rather have been a French peasant, and worn wooden shoes.I would rather
have lived in a hut with a vine growing over the door, and the grapes
growing purple in the kisses of the Autumn sun.I would rather have been
that poor peasant with my loving wife by my side, knitting as the day
died out of the sky--with my children upon my knees and their arms about
me; I would rather have been that man and gone down to the tongueless
silence of the dreamless dust, than to have been that imperial
impersonation of force and murder known as Napoleon the Great.And so I
would, ten thousand times.Eulogy on J. G. Blaine

This is a grand year--a year filled with recollections of the
Revolution; filled with the proud and tender memories of the past; with
the sacred legends of liberty; a year in which the sons of freedom will
drink from the fountains of enthusiasm; a year in which the people call
for a man who has preserved in Congress what our soldiers won upon
the field; a year in which they call for the man who has torn from the
throat of treason the tongue of slander--for the man who has snatched
the mask of Democracy from the hideous face of rebellion; for this man
who, like an intellectual athlete, has stood in the arena of debate and
challenged all comers, and who is still a total stranger to defeat.Like
an armed warrior, like a plumed knight, James G. Blaine marched down the
halls of the American Congress and threw his shining lance full and
fair against the brazen foreheads of the defamers of his country and the
maligners of her honor.For the Republican party to desert this gallant
leader now is as though an army should desert their General upon the
field of battle.James G. Blaine is now and has been for years the
bearer of the sacred standard of the Republican party.A Model Leader

The Republicans of the United States want a man who knows that this
Government should protect every citizen, at home and abroad; who knows
that any Government that will not defend its defenders and protect its
protectors is a disgrace to the map of the world.They demand a man who
believes in the eternal separation and divorcement of church and school.They demand a man whose political reputation is as spotless as a star;
but they do not demand that their candidate shall have a certificate of
moral character signed by a Confederate Congress.The man who has, in
full, heaped and rounded measure, all these splendid qualifications is
the present grand and gallant leader of the Republican party--James G.
Blaine.Our country, crowned with the vast and marvelous achievements
of its first century, asks for a man worthy of the past and prophetic
of her future; asks for a man who has the audacity of genius; asks for
a man who is the grandest combination of heart, conscience and brain
beneath her flag.Such a man is James G. Blaine.Abraham Lincoln

This world has not been fit to live in fifty years.There is no liberty
in it--very little.Why, it is only a few years ago that all the
Christian nations were engaged in the slave trade.It was not until 1808
that England abolished the slave trade, and up to that time her priests
in her churches and her judges on her benches owned stock in slave
ships, and luxuriated on the profits of piracy and murder; and when a
man stood up and denounced it they mobbed him as though he had been a
common burglar or a horse thief.It was not until the 28th
day of August, 1833, that England abolished slavery in her colonies; and
it was not until the 1st day of January, 1862, that Abraham Lincoln, by
direction of the entire North, wiped that infamy out of this country;
and I never speak of Abraham Lincoln but I want to say that he was, in
my judgment, in many respects the grandest man ever President of the
United States.I say that upon his tomb there ought to be this line--and
I know of no other man deserving it so well as he: "Here lies one who
having been clothed with almost absolute power never abused it except on
the side of mercy."Swedenborg

Swedenborg was a man of great intellect, of vast acquirements, and of
honest intentions; and I think it equally clear that upon one subject,
at least, his mind was touched, shattered and shaken.Misled by
analogies, imposed upon by the bishop, deceived by the woman, borne to
other worlds upon the wings of dreams, living in the twilight of reason
and the dawn of insanity, he regarded every fact as a patched and ragged
garment with a lining of the costliest silk, and insisted that the wrong
side, even of the silk, was far more beautiful than the right.Jeremy Bentham

The glory of Bentham is, that he gave the true basis of morals, and
furnished the statesmen with the star and compass of this sentence: "The
greatest happiness of the greatest number."Charles Fourier

Fourier sustained about the same relation to this world that Swedenborg
did to the other.There must be something wrong about the brain of one
who solemnly asserts that "the elephant, the ox and the diamond were
created by the Sun; the horse, the lily, and the ruby, by Saturn; the
cow, the jonquil and the topaz, by Jupiter; and the dog, the violet
and the opal stones by the earth itself."And yet, forgetting these
aberrations of the mind, this lunacy of a great and loving soul, for
one, that's in tender-est regard the memory of Charles Fourier, one of
the best and noblest of our race.Auguste Comte

There was in the brain of the great Frenchman--Auguste Comte--the dawn
of that happy day in which humanity will be the only religion, good the
only God, happiness the only object, restitution the only atonement,
mistake the only sin, and affection guided by intelligence, the only
savior of mankind.This dawn enriched his poverty, illuminated the
darkness of his life, peopled his loneliness with the happy millions yet
to be, and filled his eyes with proud and tender tears.When everything
connected with Napoleon, except his crimes, shall be forgotten, Auguste
Comte will be lovingly remembered as a benefactor of the human race.Herbert Spencer

Herbert Spencer relies upon evidence, upon demonstration, upon
experience; and occupies himself with one world at a time.He perceives
that there is a mental horizon that we cannot pierce, and that beyond
that is the unknown, possibly the unknowable.He endeavors to examine
only that which is capable of being examined, and considers the
theological method as not only useless, but hurtful.After all God is
but a guess, throned and established by arrogance and assertion.Turning his attention to those things that have in some way affected
the condition of mankind, Spencer leaves the unknowable to priests and
believers.Robert Collyer

I have the honor of a slight acquaintance with Robert Collyer.I have
read with pleasure some of his exquisite productions.He has a brain
full of the dawn, the head of a philosopher, the imagination of a poet
and the sincere heart of a child.Had such men as Robert Collyer and
John Stuart Mill been present at the burning of Servetus, they would
have extinguished the flames with their tears.Had the presbytery of
Chicago been there, they would have quietly turned their backs, solemnly
divided their coat tails, and warmed themselves.John Milton

England was filled with Puritan gloom and Episcopal ceremony.All
religious conceptions were of the grossest nature.The ideas of crazy
fanatics and extravagant poets were taken as sober facts.Milton had
clothed Christianity in the soiled and faded finery of the gods--had
added to the story of Christ the fables of Mythology, He gave to the
Protestant Church the most outrageously material ideas of the Deity.He turned all the angels into soldiers--made heaven a battlefield, put
Christ in uniform, and described God as a militia general.His works
were considered by the Protestants nearly as sacred as the Bible
itself, and the imagination of the people was thoroughly polluted by the
horrible imagery, the sublime absurdity of the blind Milton.Ernst Haeckel

Amongst the bravest, side by side with the greatest of the world in
Germany, the land of science--stands Ernst Haeckel, who may be said
not only to have demonstrated the theories of Darwin, but the monistic
conception of the world.He has endeavored--and I think with complete
success--to show that there is not, and never was, and never can be,
the creator of anything.Haeckel is one of the bitterest enemies of the
church, and is, therefore, one of the bravest friends of man.Professor Swing, a Dove amongst Vultures

Professor Swing was too good a man to stay in the Presbyterian Church.He was a rose amongst thistles; he was a dove amongst vultures; and they
hunted him out, and I am glad he came out.I have the greatest respect
for Professor Swing, but I want him to tell whether the 109th Psalm is
inspired.Queen Victoria and George Eliot

Compare George Eliot with Queen Victoria.The Queen is clad in garments
given her by blind fortune and unreasoning chance, while George Eliot
wears robes of glory woven in the loom of her own genius.The time is coming when men will be rated at their real
worth; when we shall care nothing for an officer if he does not fill his
place.Bough on Rabbi Bien

I will not answer Rabbi Bien, and I will tell you why.Because he has
taken himself outside of all the limits of a gentleman; because he has
taken upon himself to traduce American women in language the beastliest
I ever read; and any man who says that the American women are not just
as good women as any God can make, and pick his mind to-day, is an
unappreciative barbarian.I will let him alone because he denounced all
the men in this country, all the members of Congress, all the members
of the Senate, all the Judges on the bench, as thieves and robbers.I
pronounce him a vulgar falsifier, and let him alone.General Garfield

No man has been nominated for the office since I was born, by either
party, who had more brains and more heart than James A. Garfield.He
was a soldier, he is a statesman.In time of peace he preferred the
avocations of peace; when the bugle of war blew in his ears he withdrew
from his work and fought for the flag, and then he went back to the
avocation of peace.And I say to-day that a man who, in a time of
profound peace, makes up his mind that he would like to kill folks for
a living is no better, to say the least of it, than the man who loves
peace in the time of peace, and who, when his country is attacked,
rushes to the rescue of her flag."Wealthy in Integrity; In Brain a Millionaire."James A. Garfield is to-day a poor man, and you know that there is not
money enough in this magnificent street to buy the honor and manhood of
James A. Garfield.Money cannot make such a man, and I will swear to you
that money cannot buy him.James A. Garfield to-day wears the glorious
robe of honest poverty.He is a poor man; but I like to say it here in
Wall street; I like to say it surrounded by the millions of America; I
like to say it in the midst of banks, and bonds, and stocks; I love to
say it where gold is piled--that, although a poor man, he is rich in
honor, in integrity he is wealthy, and in brain he is a millionaire.Garfield a Certificate of the Splendor of the American Constitution

Garfield is a certificate of the splendor of our Government, that says
to every poor boy: "All the avenues of honor are open to you."He is a scholar; he is a statesman; he was a
soldier; he is a patriot; and above all he is a magnificent man, and if
every man in New York knew him as well as I do, Garfield would not lose
a hundred votes in this city.W. Hiram Thomas

The best thing that has come from the other side is from Dr.I
regard him as by far the grandest intellect in the Methodist Church.He
is intellectually a wide and tender man.I cannot conceive of an article
being written in a better spirit.He finds a little fault with me for
not being exactly fair.Thomas
the probability is I never should have laid myself liable to criticism.There is some human nature in me, and I find it exceedingly difficult
to preserve at all times perfect serenity.I have the greatest possible
respect for Dr.Thomas, and must heartily thank him for his perfect
fairness.MISCELLANEOUS




355.Heresy and Orthodoxy

It has always been the man ahead that has been called the heretic.Heresy is the last and best thought always!Heresy extends the
hospitality of the brain to a new idea; that is what the rotting says to
flax growing; that is what the dweller in the swamp says to the man on
the sun-lit hill; that is what the man in the darkness cries out to the
grand man upon whose forehead is shining the dawn of a grander day; that
is what the coffin says to the cradle.Orthodoxy is a kind of shroud,
and heresy is a banner--Orthodoxy is a fog and Heresy a star shining
forever upon the cradle of truth.I do not mean simply in religion, I
mean in everything and the idea I wish to impress upon you is that you
should keep your minds open to all the influences of nature, you should
keep your minds open to reason; hear what a man has to say, and do not
let the turtle-shell of bigotry grow above your brain.Give everybody a
chance and an opportunity; that is all.We used to worship the golden calf, and the worst you can say of us now,
is, we worship the gold of the calf, and even the calves are beginning
to see this distinction.We used to go down on our knees to every man
that held office, now he must fill it if he wishes any respect.We care
nothing for the rich, except what will they do with their money?How does he fill it?--that is the question.And there is rapidly growing
up in the world an aristocracy of heart and brain--the only aristocracy
that has a right to exist.Truth will Bear the Test

If a man has a diamond that has been examined by the lapidaries of the
world, and some ignorant stonecutter told him that it is nothing but
an ordinary rock, he laughs at him; but if it has not been examined
by lapidaries, and he is a little suspicious himself that it is not
genuine, it makes him mad.Any doctrine that will not bear investigation
is not a fit tenant for the mind of an honest man.Any man who is afraid
to have his doctrine investigated is not only a coward but a hypocrite.Paring Nails

Why should we in this age of the world be dominated by the dead?Why
should barbarian Jews who went down to death and dust three thousand
years ago, control the living world?Why should we care for the
superstition of men who began the sabbath by paring their nails,
"beginning at the fourth finger, then going to the second, then to the
fifth, then to the third, and ending with the thumb?"How pleasing to
God this must have been.There may be a God

There may be for aught I know, somewhere in the unknown shoreless vast,
some being whose dreams are constellations and within whose thought the
infinite exists.About this being, if such an one exists, I have nothing
to say.He has written no books, inspired no barbarians, required no
worship, and has prepared no hell in which to burn the honest seeker
after truth.The People are Beginning to Think

The people are beginning to think, to reason and to investigate.Slowly,
painfully, but surely, the gods are being driven from the earth.Only
upon rare occasions are they, even by the most religious, supposed to
interfere in the affairs of men.In most matters we are at last supposed
to be free.Since the invention of steamships and railways, so that the
products of all countries can be easily interchanged, the gods have quit
the business of producing famine.Unchained Thought

For the vagaries of the clouds the infidels propose to substitute the
realities of earth; for superstition, the splendid demonstrations and
achievements of science; and for theological tyranny, the chainless
liberty of thought.Man the Victor of the Future

If abuses are destroyed, man must destroy them.If slaves are freed, man
must free them.If new truths are discovered, man must discover them.If the naked are clothed; if the hungry are fed; if justice is done;
if labor is rewarded; if superstition is driven from the mind; if the
defenseless are protected, and if the right finally triumphs, all must
be the work of man.The grand victories of the future must be won by
man, and by man alone.The Sacred Sabbath

Of all the superstitious of mankind, this insanity about the "sacred
Sabbath" is the most absurd.The idea of feeling it a duty to be solemn
and sad one-seventh of the time!To think that we can please an infinite
being by staying in some dark and sombre room, instead of walking in the
perfumed fields!Why should God hate to see a man happy?Why should it
excite his wrath to see a family in the woods, by some babbling stream,
talking, laughing and loving?Nature works on that "sacred" day.The
earth turns, the rivers run, the trees grow, buds burst into flower, and
birds fill the air with song.Why should we look sad, and think about
death, and hear about-hell?Why should that day be filled with gloom
instead of joy?Make the Sabbath Merry

Freethinkers should make the Sabbath a day of mirth and music; a day to
spend with wife and child--a day of games, and books, and dreams--a day
to put fresh flowers above our sleeping dead--a day of memory and hope,
of love and rest.Away to the Hills and the Sea

A poor mechanic, working all the week in dust and noise, needs a day of
rest and joy, a day to visit stream and wood--a day to live with wife
and child; a day in which to laugh at care, and gather hope and strength
for toils to come.And his weary wife needs a breath of sunny air, away
from street and wall, amid the hills or by the margin of the sea, where
she can sit and prattle with her babe, and fill with happy dreams the
long, glad day.Melancholy Sundays

When I was a little fellow most everybody thought that some days were
too sacred for the young ones to enjoy themselves in.Sunday used to commence Saturday night at sundown, under
the old text, "The evening and the morning were the first day."They
commenced then, I think, to get a good ready.When the sun went down
Saturday night, darkness ten thousand times deeper than ordinary night
fell upon that house.The boy that looked the sickest was regarded as
the most pious.You could not crack hickory nuts that night, and if you
were caught chewing gum it was another evidence of the total depravity
of the human heart.We would sometimes
sing, "Another day has passed."Everybody looked as though they had the
dyspesia--you know lots of people think they are pious, just because
they are bilious, as Mr.It was a solemn night, and the next
morning the solemnity had increased.Then we went to church, and the
minister was in a pulpit about twenty feet high.If it was in the winter
there was no fire; it was not thought proper to be comfortable while you
were thanking the Lord.The minister commenced at firstly and ran up to
about twenty-fourthly, and then he divided it up again; and then he
made some concluding remarks, and then he said lastly, and when he said
lastly he was about half through.Moses took Egyptian Law for his Model

It has been contended for many years that the ten commandments are the
foundation of all ideas of justice and of law.Eminent jurists have
bowed to popular prejudice, and deformed their works by statements to
the effect that the Mosaic laws are the fountains from which sprang all
ideas of right and wrong.Nothing can be more stupidly false than such
assertions.Thousands of years before Moses was born, the Egyptians
had a code of laws.They had laws against blasphemy, murder, adultery,
larceny, perjury, laws for the collection of debts, and the enforcement
of contracts.A False Standard of Success

It is not necessary to be rich, nor powerful, nor great, to be a
success; and neither is it necessary to have your name between the
putrid lips of rumor to be great.We have had a false standard of
success.In the years when I was a little boy we read in our books that
no fellow was a success that did not make a fortune or get a big office,
and he generally was a man that slept about three hours a night.They
never put down in the books the gentlemen who succeeded in life and yet
slept all they wanted to.Toilers and Idlers

You can divide mankind into two classes: the laborers and the idlers,
the supporters and the supported, the honest and the dishonest.Every
man is dishonest who lives upon the unpaid labor of others, no matter
if he occupies a throne.The laborers
should have equal-rights before the world and before the law.And I want
every farmer to consider every man who labors either with hand or brain
as his brother.Until genius and labor formed a partnership there was
no such thing as prosperity among men.Every reaper and mower, every
agricultural implement, has elevated the work of the farmer, and his
vocation grows grander with every invention.In the olden time the
agriculturist was ignorant; he knew nothing of machinery, he was the
slave of superstition.The Sad Wilderness History

While reading the Pentateuch, I am filled with indignation, pity and
horror.Nothing can be sadder than the history of the starved and
frightened wretches who wandered over the desolate crags and sands of
wilderness and desert, the prey of famine, sword and plague.Ignorant
and superstitious to the last degree, governed by falsehood, plundered
by hypocrisy, they were the sport of priests, and the food of fear.God
was their greatest enemy, and death their only friend.Law Much Older than Sinai

Laws spring from the instinct of self-preservation.Industry objected
to supporting idleness, and laws were made against theft.Laws were made
against murder, because a very large majority of the people have always
objected to being murdered.All fundamental laws were born simply of the
instinct of self-defence.Long before the Jewish savages assembled at
the foot of Sinai, laws had been made and enforced, not only in Egypt
and India, but by every tribe that ever existed.God raised the black flag, and
commanded his soldiers to kill even the smiling infant in its mother's
arms.Who is the blasphemer; the man who denies the existence of God, or
he who covers the robes of the infinite with innocent blood?Standing Tip for God

We are told in the Pentateuch that God, the father of us all, gave
thousands of maidens, after having killed their fathers, their mothers,
and their brothers, to satisfy the brutal lusts of savage men.If there
be a God, I pray him to write in his book, opposite my name, that I
denied this lie for him.Matter and Force

The statement in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth, I
cannot accept.It is contrary to my reason, and I cannot believe it.It
appears reasonable for me that force has existed from eternity.Force
cannot, as it appears to me, exist apart from matter.Force, in its
nature, is forever active, and without matter it could not act; and so
I think matter must have existed forever.To conceive of matter without
force, or of force without matter, or of a time when neither existed,
or of a being who existed for an eternity without either, and who out of
nothing created both, is to me utterly impossible.It may be that I am led to these conclusions by "total depravity," or
that I lack the necessary humility of spirit to satisfactorily harmonize
Haeckel and Moses; or that I am carried away by pride, blinded by
reason, given over to hardness of heart that I might be damned, but I
never can believe that the earth was covered with leaves, and buds, and
flowers, and fruits, before the sun with glittering spear had driven
back the hosts of night.We are told that God made man; and the question naturally arises, how
was this done?Was it by a process of "evolution," "development;" the
"transmission of acquired habits;" the "survival of the fittest," or was
the necessary amount of clay kneaded to the proper consistency, and then
by the hands of God moulded into form?Modern science tells that man has
been evolved, through countless epochs, from the lower forms; that he
is the result of almost an infinite number of actions, reactions,
experiences, states, forms, wants and adaptations.General Joshua

My own opinion is that General Joshua knew no more about the motions of
the earth than he did mercy and justice.If he had known that the earth
turned upon its axis at the rate of a thousand miles an hour, and swept
in its course about the sun at the rate of sixty-eight thousand miles
an hour, he would have doubled the hailstones, spoken of in the same
chapter, that the Lord cast down from heaven, and allowed the sun and
moon to rise and set in the usual way.This getting up so early in the morning is a relic of barbarism.It has
made hundreds of thousands of young men curse business.There is no need
of getting up at three or four o'clock in the winter morning.The farmer
who persists in dragging his wife and children from their beds ought to
be visited by a missionary.It is time enough to rise after the sun has
set the example.Why
not feed them more the night before?In the old
times they used to get up about three o'clock in the morning, and go to
work long before the sun had risen with "healing upon his wings," and as
a just punishment they all had the ague; and they ought to have it now.Sleep is the best medicine
in the world.There is no such thing as health, without plenty of sleep.When you work, work;
and when you get through take a good, long and refreshing sleep.Never Rise at Four O'Clock

The man who cannot get a living upon Illinois soil without rising before
daylight ought to starve.Eight hours a day is enough for any farmer to
work except in harvest time.When you rise at four and work till dark
what is life worth?Of what use are all the improvements in farming?Of what use is all the improved machinery unless it tends to give the
farmer a little more leisure?What is harvesting now, compared with what
it was in the old time?Think of the days of reaping, of cradling, of
raking and binding and mowing.Think of threshing with the flail and
winnowing with the wind.And now think of the reapers and mowers, the
binders and threshing machines, the plows and cultivators, upon which
the farmer rides protected from the sun.If, with all these advantages,
you cannot get a living without rising in the middle of the night, go
into some other business.The Hermit is Mad

A hermit is a mad man.Without friends and wife and child, there is
nothing left worth living for.They
are filled with egotism and envy, with vanity and hatred.People who
live much alone become narrow and suspicious.They are apt to be the
property of one idea.They begin to think there is no use in anything.They look upon the happiness of others as a kind of folly.They hate
joyous folks, because, way down in their hearts, they envy them.Duke Orang-Outang

I think we came from the lower animals.I am not dead sure of it, but
think so.When I first read about it I didn't like it.My heart was
filled with sympathy for those people who leave nothing to be proud of
except ancestors.I thought how terrible this will be upon the nobility
of the old world.Think of their being forced to trace their ancestry
back to the Duke Orang-Outang or to the Princess Chimpanzee.After
thinking it all over I came to the conclusion that I liked that
doctrine.I read about
rudimentary bones and muscles.I was told that everybody had rudimentary
muscles extending from the ear into the cheek.I was told: "They are the remains of muscles; they became rudimentary
from the lack of use."They are the muscles
with which your ancestors used to flap their ears.Well, at first I was
greatly astonished, and afterward I was more astonished to find they had
become rudimentary.Self-Made Men

It is often said of this or that man that he is a self-made man--that
he was born of the poorest and humblest parents, and that with every
obstacle to overcome he became great.Most of the intellectual giants of the world
have been nursed at the sad but loving breast of poverty.Most of those
who have climbed highest on the shining ladder of fame commenced at the
lowest round.They were reared in the straw thatched cottages of Europe;
in the log houses of America; in the factories of the great cities; in
the midst of toil; in the smoke and din of labor.The One Window in the Ark

A cubit is twenty-two inches; so that the ark was five hundred and fifty
feet long, ninety-one feet and eight inches wide, and fifty-five feet
high.The ark was divided into three stories, and had on top, one window
twenty-two inches square.Ventillation must have been one of Jehovah's
hobbies.Think of a ship larger than the Great Eastern with only one
window, and that but twenty-two inches square!No Ante-Diluvian Camp-Meetings!It is a little curious that when God wished to reform the ante-diluvian
world he said nothing about hell; that he had no revivals, no
camp-meetings, no tracts, no out-pourings of the Holy Ghost, no
baptisms, no noon prayer meetings, and never mentioned the great
doctrine of salvation by faith.If the orthodox creeds of the world are
true, all those people went to hell without ever having heard that such
a place existed.If eternal torment is a fact, surely these miserable
wretches ought to have been warned.They were threatened only with water
when they were in fact doomed to eternal fire!Hard Work in the Ark

Eight persons did all the work.They attended to the wants of 175,000
birds, 3,616 beasts, 1,300 reptiles, and 2,000,000 insects, saying
nothing of countless animalculae.Can we believe that the inspired writer had any idea of the size of the
sun?Draw a circle five inches in diameter, and by its side thrust a pin
through the paper.The hole made by the pin will sustain about the same
relation to the circle that the earth does to the sun.Did he know that
the sun was eight hundred and sixty thousand miles in diameter; that it
was enveloped in an ocean of fire thousands of miles in depth, hotter
even than the Christian's hell?Did he know that the volume of the Earth
is less than one-millionth of that of the sun?Did he know of the one
hundred and four planets belonging to our solar system, all children of
the sun?Did he know of Jupiter eighty-five thousand miles in diameter,
hundreds of times as large as our earth, turning on his axis at the rate
of twenty-five thousand miles an hour accompanied by four moons making
the tour of his orbit once only in fifty years?Something for Nothing

It is impossible for me to conceive of something being created for
nothing.Nothing, regarded in the light of raw material, is a decided
failure.Neither is it
possible to think of force disconnected with matter.You cannot imagine
matter going back to absolute nothing.Neither can you imagine nothing
being changed into something.You may be eternally damned if you do not
say that you can conceive these things, but you cannot conceive them.Polygamy

Polygamy is just as pure in Utah as it could have been in the promised
land.Love and virtue are the same the whole world around, and justice
is the same in every star.All the languages of the world are not
sufficient to express the filth of polygamy.It makes of man a beast,
of woman a trembling slave.It destroys the fireside, makes virtue an
outcast, takes from human speech its sweetest words, and leaves the
heart a den, where crawl and hiss the slimy serpents of most loathsome
lust.The good family is the unit
of good government.The virtues grow about the holy hearth of home--they
cluster, bloom, and shed their perfume round the fireside where the
one man loves the one woman.Lover--husband--wife--mother--father--child--home!--without these sacred
words the world is but a lair, and men and women merely beasts.The Colonel in the Kitchen--How to Cook a Beefsteak

There ought to be a law making it a crime, punishable by imprisonment,
to fry a beefsteak.Broil it; it is just as easy, and when broiled it
is delicious.Fried beefsteak is not fit for a wild beast.You can broil
even on a stove.Shut the front damper--open the back one, and then take
off a griddle.There will then be a draft down through this opening.Put
on your steak, using a wire broiler, and not a particle of smoke will
touch it, for the reason that the smoke goes down.If you try to broil
it with the front damper open the smoke will rise.For broiling, coal,
even soft coal, makes a better fire than wood.Do not huddle together in a little room
around a red-hot stove, with every window fastened down.Do not live in
this poisoned atmosphere, and then, when one of your children dies, put
a piece in the papers commencing with, "Whereas, it has pleased divine
Providence to remove from our midst--."Have plenty of air, and plenty
of warmth.Do not imagine anything is unhealthy
simply because it is pleasant.Cooking a Fine Art

Cooking is one of the fine arts.Give your wives and daughters things to
cook, and things to cook with, and they will soon become most excellent
cooks.The man whose arteries
and veins are filled with rich blood made of good and well cooked food,
has pluck, courage, endurance and noble impulses.Remember that your
wife should have things to cook with.Scathing Impeachment of Intemperance

Intemperance cuts down youth in its vigor, manhood in its strength, and
age in its weakness.It breaks the father's heart, bereaves the doting
mother, extinguishes natural affections, erases conjugal loves, blots
out filial attachments, blights parental hope, and brings down mourning
age in sorrow to the grave.It produces weakness, not strength;
sickness, not health; death, not life.It makes wives widows; children
orphans; fathers fiends, and all of them paupers and beggars.It feeds
rheumatism, nurses gout, welcomes epidemics, invites cholera, imports
pestilence and embraces consumption.It covers the land with idleness,
misery and crime.It fills your jails, supplies your almshouses and
demands your asylums.It engenders controversies, fosters quarrels, and
cherishes riots.It crowds your penitentiaries and furnishes victims to
your scaffolds.It is the life blood of the gambler, the element of
the burglar, the prop of the highwayman and the support of the midnight
incendiary.It countenances the liar, respects the thief, esteems
the blasphemer.It violates obligations, reverences fraud, and honors
infamy.It defames benevolence, hates love, scorns virtue and slanders
innocence.It incites the father to butcher his helpless offspring,
helps the husband to massacre his wife, and the child to grind the
parricidal ax.It burns up men, consumes women, detests life, curses God,
and despises heaven.It suborns witnesses, nurses perjury, defiles
the jury box, and stains the judicial ermine.It degrades the citizen,
debases the legislator, dishonors statesmen, and disarms the patriot.It
brings shame, not honor; terror, not safety; despair, not hope; misery,
not happiness; and with the malevolence of a fiend, it calmly surveys
its frightful desolation, and unsatisfied with its havoc, it poisons
felicity, kills peace, ruins morals, blights confidence, slays
reputation, and wipes out national honors, then curses the world and
laughs at its ruin.Liberty Defined

The French convention gave the best definition of liberty I have ever
read: "The liberty of one citizen ceases only where the liberty of
another citizen commences."I ask you
to-day to make a declaration of individual independence.And if you are
independent, be just.Allow everybody else to make his declaration of
individual independence.Allow your wife, allow your husband, allow
your children to make theirs.It is a grand thing to be the owner of
yourself.It is a grand thing to protect the rights of others.It is a
sublime thing to be free and just.Free, Honest Thought

I am going to say what little I can to make the American people brave
enough and generous enough and kind enough to give everybody else the
rights they have themselves.Can there ever be any progress in this
world to amount to anything until we have liberty?The thoughts of a man
who is not free are not worth much--not much.A man who thinks with the
club of a creed above his head--a man who thinks casting his eye askance
at the flames of hell, is not apt to have very good thoughts.And for
my part, I would not care to have any status or social position even in
heaven if I had to admit that I never would have been there only I got
scared.When we are frightened we do not think very well.If you want to
get at the honest thoughts of a man he must free.If he is not free you
will not get his honest thought.Ingersoll Prefers Shoemakers to Princes

The other day there came shoemakers, potters, workers in wood and iron,
from Europe, and they were received in the city of New York as though
they had been princes.They had been sent by the great republic of
France to examine into the arts and manufactures of the great republic
of America.They looked a thousand times better to me than the Edward
Alberts and Albert Edwards--the royal vermin, that live on the body
politic.And I would think much more of our government if it would fete
and feast them, instead of wining and dining the imbeciles of a royal
line.I never saw a dignified man that was not after all an
old idiot Dignity is a mask; a dignified man is afraid that you will
know he does not know everything.A man of sense and argument is always
willing to admit what he don't know--why?--because there is so much
that he does know; and that is the first step towards learning
anything--willingness to admit what you don't know, and when you don't
understand a thing, ask--no matter how small and silly it may look to
other people--ask, and after that you know.A man never is in a state of
mind that he can learn until he gets that dignified nonsense out of him.The time is coming when a man will be rated at his real worth, and that
by his brain and heart.We care nothing now about an officer unless he
fills his place.The time will come when no matter how much money a man
has he will not be respected unless he is using it for the benefit of
his fellow-men.Three millions have increased to fifty--thirteen
States to thirty-eight.We have better homes, and more of the
conveniences of life than any other people upon the face of the globe.The farmers of our country live better than did the kings and princes
two hundred years ago--and they have twice as much sense and heart.Remember that the man who acts best his part--who loves
his friends the best--is most willing to help others--truest to the
obligation--who has the best heart--the most feeling--the deepest
sympathies--and who freely gives to others the rights that he claims for
himself, is the true nobleman.We have disfranchised the aristocrats of
the air and have given one country to mankind.Wanted!--More Manliness

I had a thousand times rather have a farm and be independent, than to be
President of the United States, without independence, filled with
doubt and trembling, feeling of the popular pulse, resorting to art and
artifice, inquiring about the wind of opinion, and succeeding at last in
losing my self-respect without gaining the respect of others.Man needs
more manliness, more real independence.This we can do by labor, and in this way we can preserve our
independence.We should try and choose that business or profession the
pursuit of which will give us the most happiness.We can be happy without being rich--without holding office--without
being famous.I am not sure that we can be happy with wealth, with
office, or with fame.Education of Nature

It has been a favorite idea with me that our forefathers were educated
by nature; that they grew grand as the continent upon which they landed;
that the great rivers--the wide plains--the splendid lakes--the lonely
forests--the sublime mountains--that all these things stole into and
became a part of their being, and they grew great as the country in
which they lived.They began to hate the narrow, contracted views of
Europe.The Worker Wearing the Purple

I want to see a workingman have a good house, painted white, grass in
the front yard, carpets on the floor and pictures on the wall.I want to
see him a man feeling that he is a king by the divine right of living in
the Republic.And every man here is just a little bit a king, you know.Every man here is a part of the sovereign power.Every man wears a
little of purple; every man has a little of crown and a little of
sceptre; and every man that will sell his vote for money or be ruled by
prejudice is unfit to be an American citizen.Flowers

Beautify your grounds with plants and flowers and vines.Remember that everything of beauty tends to the elevation of
man.Every little morning-glory whose purple bosom is thrilled with the
amorous kisses of the sun tends to put a blossom in your heart.Do not
judge of the value of everything by the market reports.Every flower
about a house certifies to the refinement of somebody.Every vine,
climbing and blossoming, tells of love and joy.The grave is not a throne, and a corpse is not a king.The living have
a right to control this world.I think a good deal more of to day than
I do of yesterday, and I think more of to-morrow than I do of this day;
because it is nearly gone--that is the way I feel.The time to be happy
is now; the way to be happy is to make somebody else happy and the place
to be happy is here.The School House a Fort

Education is the most radical thing in the world.To teach the alphabet is to inaugurate a revolution.To build a school
house is to construct a fort.We are Getting Free

We are getting free.We are
investigating with the microscope and the telescope.We are digging
into the earth and finding souvenirs of all the ages.We are finding out
something about the laws of health and disease.We are adding years to
the span of human life and we are making the world fit to live in.That is what we are doing, and every man that has an honest thought and
expresses it helps, and every man that tries to keep honest thought from
being expressed is an obstruction and a hindrance.The Solid Rock

I have made up my mind that if there is a God He will be merciful to the
merciful.That He will forgive the forgiving;
upon that rock I stand.That every man should be true to himself, and
that there is no world, no star, in which honesty is a crime; and upon
that rock I stand.An honest man, a good, kind, sweet woman, or a happy
child, has nothing to fear, neither in this world nor the world to come;
and upon that rock I stand.INGERSOLL'S FIVE GOSPELS




408.The Gospel of Cheerfulness

I believe in the gospel of cheerfulness; the gospel of good nature; in
the gospel of good health.Let us pay some attention to our bodies; take
care of our bodies, and our souls will take care of themselves.I believe the time will come when the public thought will be so
great and grand that it will be looked upon as infamous to perpetuate
disease.I believe the time will come when men will not fill the future
with consumption and with insanity.I believe the time will come when
with studying ourselves and understanding the laws of health, we will
say we are under obligations to put the flags of health in the cheeks of
our children.Even if I got to Heaven, and had a harp, I would hate to
look back upon my children and see them diseased, deformed, crazed, all
suffering the penalty of crimes that I had committed.The Gospel of Liberty

And I believe, too, in the gospel of liberty,---of giving to others what
we claim.And I believe there is room everywhere for thought, and
the more liberty you give away the more you will have.In liberty
extravagance is economy.Let us be just, let us be generous to each
other.The Gospel of 'Good Living

I believe in the gospel of good living.You cannot make any God happy by
fasting.Let us have good food, and let us have it well cooked; it is
a thousand times better to know how to cook it than it is to understand
any theology in the world.I
believe in the gospel of good houses; in the gospel of water and soap.The Gospel of Intelligence

I believe in the gospel of intelligence.That is the only lever capable
of raising mankind.I believe in the gospel of intelligence; in the
gospel of education.The school-house is my cathedral; the universe
is my Bible.And no God can put a man into hell in another world who has
made a little heaven in this.God cannot make miserable a man who has
made somebody else happy.God can not hate anybody who is capable of
loving his neighbor.So I believe in this great gospel of generosity.Ah, but they say it won't do.My gospel
of health will prolong life; my gospel of intelligence, my gospel of
loving, my gospel of good-fellowship will cover the world with happy
homes.My doctrine will put carpets upon your floors, pictures upon your
walls.My doctrine will put books upon your shelves, ideas in your mind.My doctrine will relieve the world of the abnormal monsters born of the
ignorance of superstition.My doctrine will give us health, wealth, and
happiness.The Gospel of Justice

I believe in the gospel of justice,--that we must reap what we sow.Smith, and God forgive me,
how does that help Smith?If I by slander cover some poor girl with
the leprosy of some imputed crime, and she withers away like a blighted
flower, and afterwards I get forgiveness, how does that help her?If
there is another world, we have got to settle; no bankruptcy court
there.Among the ancient Jews if you committed a crime you
had to kill a sheep; now they say, "Charge it.For every crime you commit you must answer to yourself and
to the one you injure.And if you have ever clothed another with
unhappiness as with a garment cf pain, you will never be quite as
happy as though you hadn't done that thing.No forgiveness, eternal,
inexorable, everlasting justice--that is what I believe in.And if it goes hard with me, I will stand it.And I will stick to my
logic, and I will bear it like a man.GEMS FROM THE CONTROVERSIAL GASKET

     Latest Utterances of Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll,
     in a Controversy with Judge Jere 8.Black,
     on "The Christian Religion"




413.The Origin of the Controversy

Several months ago, _The North American Review_ asked me to write an
article, saying that it would be published if some one would furnish a
reply.I wrote the article that appeared in the August number, and by
me it was entitled "Is All of the Bible Inspired?"Not until the
article was written did I know who was expected to answer.I make this
explanation for the purpose of dissipating the impression that Mr.To have struck his shield with my lance might
have given birth to the impression that I was somewhat doubtful as to
the correctness of my position.I naturally expected an answer from some
professional theologian, and was surprised to find that a reply had been
written by a "policeman," who imagined that he had answered my arguments
by simply telling me that my statements were false.It is somewhat
unfortunate that in a discussion like this any one should resort to the
slightest personal detraction.The theme is great enough to engage the
highest faculties of the human mind, and in the investigation of such a
subject vituperation is singularly and vulgarly out of place.Arguments
cannot be answered with insults.It is unfortunate that the intellectual
arena should be entered by a "policeman," who has more confidence in
concussion than discussion.Good nature is often
mistaken for virtue, and good health sometimes passes for genius.Anger blows out the lamp of the mind.In the examination of a great and
important question, every one should be serene, slow-pulsed, and calm.Black's reply, feeling that so
grand a subject should not be blown and tainted with malicious words, I
proceed to answer as best I may the arguments he has urged.Of course it is still claimed that we are a Christian people, indebted
to something we call Christianity, for all the progress we have made.There is still a vast difference of opinion as to what Christianity
really is, although many wavering sects have been discussing that
question, with fire and sword through centuries of creed and crime.Every new sect has been denounced at its birth as illegitimate, as
something born out of orthodox wedlock, and that should have been
allowed to perish on the steps where it was found.Summary of Evangelical Belief

Among the evangelical churches there is a substantial agreement
upon what they consider the fundamental truths of the gospel.These
fundamental truths, as I understand them, are:--That there is a personal
God, the creator of the material universe; that he made man of the dust,
and woman from part of the man; that the man and woman were tempted by
the devil; that they were turned out of the garden of Eden; that, about
fifteen hundred years afterward, God's patience having been exhausted by
the wickedness of mankind, He drowned His children, with the exception
of eight persons; that afterward He selected from their descendants
Abraham, and through him the Jewish people; that He gave laws to these
people, and tried to govern them in all things; that He made known His
will in many ways; that He wrought a vast number of miracles; that
He inspired men to write the Bible; that, in the fullness of time, it
having been found impossible to reform mankind, this God came upon earth
as a child born of the Virgin Mary; that He lived in Palestine; that He
preached for about three years, going from place to place, occasionally
raising the dead, curing the blind and the halt; that He was
crucified--for the crime of blasphemy, as the Jews supposed, but, that
as a matter of fact, He was offered as a sacrifice for the sins of
all who might have faith in Him; that He was raised from the dead and
ascended into heaven, where He now is, making intercession for His
followers; that He will forgive the sins of all who believe on Him,
and that those who do not believe will be consigned to the dungeons of
eternal pain.These--(it may be with the addition of the sacraments of
Baptism and the Last Supper)--constitute what is generally known as the
Christian religion.A Profound Change in the World of Thought

A profound change has taken place in the world of thought.The pews are
trying to set themselves somewhat above the pulpit.The layman discusses
theology with the minister, and smiles.Christians excuse themselves
for belonging to the church by denying a part of the creed.The idea
is abroad that they who know the most of nature believe the least about
theology.The sciences are regarded as infidels, and facts as scoffers.Thousands of most excellent people avoid churches, and, with few
exceptions, only those attend prayer meetings who wish to be alone.The
pulpit is losing because the people are rising.The Believer in the Inspiration of the Bible has too Much to Believe

But the believer in the inspiration of the Bible is compelled to declare
that there was a time when slavery was right--when men could buy and
women sell their babes.He is compelled to insist that there was a time
when polygamy was the highest form of virtue; when wars of extermination
were waged with the sword of mercy; when religious toleration was a
crime, and when death was the just penalty for having expressed an
honest thought.He must maintain that Jehovah is just as bad now as he
was four thousand years ago, or that he was just as good then as he is
now, but that human conditions have so changed that slavery, polygamy,
religious persecutions and wars of conquest are now perfectly devilish.Once they were right--once they were commanded by God himself; now, they
are prohibited.There has been such a change in the conditions of man
that, at the present time, the devil is in favor of slavery, polygamy,
religious persecution and wars of conquest.That is to say, the devil
entertains the same opinion to-day that Jehovah held four thousand
years ago, but in the meantime Jehovah has remained exactly the
same--changeless and incapable of change.A Frank Admission

It is most cheerfully admitted that a vast number of people not only
believe these things, but hold them in exceeding reverence, and imagine
them to be of the utmost importance to mankind.They regard the Bible as
the only light that God has given for the guidance of His children; that
it is the one star in nature's sky--the foundation of all morality, of
all law, of all order, and of all individual and national progress.They
regard it as the only means we have for ascertaining the will of God,
the origin of man, and the destiny of the soul.The mistake has hindered in countless ways the civilization of
man.The Bible Should be Better than any other Book

In all ages of which any record has been preserved, there have been
those who gave their ideas of justice, charity, liberty, love, and
law.Now, if the Bible is really the work of God, it should contain the
grandest and sublimest truths.It should, in all respects, excel the
works of man.Within that book should be found the best and loftiest
definitions of justice; the truest conceptions of human liberty; the
clearest outlines of duty; the tenderest, the highest, and the noblest
thoughts,--not that the human mind has produced, but that the human mind
is capable of receiving.Upon every page should be found the luminous
evidence of its divine origin.Unless it contains grander and more
wonderful things than man has written, we are not only justified in
saying, but we are compelled to say, that it was written by no being
superior to man.A Serious Charge

The Bible has been the fortress and the defense of nearly every crime.No civilized country could re-enact its laws.And in many respects its
moral code is abhorrent to every good and tender man.It is admitted,
however, that many of its precepts are pure, that many of its laws are
wise and just, and that many of its statements are absolutely true.If the Bible is Not Verbally Inspired, What Then?It may be said that it is unfair to call attention to certain bad things
in the Bible, while the good are not so much as mentioned.To this it
may be replied that a divine being would not put bad things in a book.Certainly a being of infinite intelligence, power, and goodness could
never fall below the ideal of "depraved and barbarous" man.It will not
do, after we find that the Bible upholds what we now call crimes, to say
that it is not verbally inspired.If the words are not inspired, what
is?It may be said that the thoughts are inspired.But this would
include only the thoughts expressed without words.If the ideas are
inspired, they must be contained in and expressed only by inspired
words; that is to say, the arrangement of the words, with relation to
each other, must have been inspired.A Hindu Example

Suppose that we should now discover a Hindu book of equal antiquity with
the Old Testament, containing a defense of slavery, polygamy, wars of
extermination, and religious persecution, would we regard it as evidence
that the writers were inspired by an infinitely wise and merciful God?A Test Fairly Applied

Suppose we knew that after "inspired" men had finished the Bible, the
devil had got possession of it and wrote a few passages, what part of
the sacred Scriptures would Christians now pick out as being probably
his work?Which of the following passages would naturally be selected
as having been written by the devil--"Love thy neighbor as thyself," or
"Kill all the males among the little ones, and kill every woman; but all
the women children keep alive for yourselves?"It will hardly be claimed at this day, that the passages in the
Bible upholding slavery, polygamy, war, and religious persecution are
evidences of the inspiration of that book.Suppose that there had been
nothing in the Old Testament upholding these crimes would any modern
Christian suspect that it was not inspired on account of that omission?Suppose that there had been nothing in the Old Testament but laws in
favor of these crimes, would any intelligent Christian now contend that
it was the work of the true God?Proofs of Civilization

We know that there was a time in the history of almost every nation when
slavery, polygamy, and wars of extermination were regarded as divine
institutions; when women were looked upon as beasts of burden, and when,
among some people, it was considered the duty of the husband to murder
the wife for differing with him on the subject of religion.Nations that
entertain these views to-day are regarded as savage, and, probably, with
the exception of the South Sea islanders, the Feejees, some citizens
of Delaware, and a few tribes in Central Africa, no human beings can be
found degraded enough to agree upon these subjects with the Jehovah of
the ancient Jews.The only evidence we have, or can have, that a
nation has ceased to be savage is the fact that it has abandoned these
doctrines.To every one, except the theologian, it is perfectly easy to
account for the mistakes, atrocities, and crimes of the past, by
saying that civilization is a slow and painful growth; that the moral
perceptions are cultivated through ages of tyranny, of want, of crime,
and of heroism; that it requires centuries for man to put out the eyes
of self and hold in lofty and in equal poise the scales of justice;
that conscience is born of suffering; that mercy is the child of the
imagination--of the power to put oneself in the sufferers place, and
that man advances only as he becomes acquainted with his surroundings,
with the mutual obligations of life, and learns to take advantage of the
forces of nature.A Persian Gospel

Do not misunderstand me.My position is that the cruel passages in
the Old Testament are not inspired; that slavery, polygamy, wars of
extermination, and religious persecution always have been, are, and
forever will be, abhorred and cursed by the honest, virtuous, and the
loving; that the innocent cannot justly suffer for the guilty, and that
vicarious vice and vicarious virtue are equally absurd; that eternal
punishment is eternal revenge; that only the natural can happen; that
miracles prove the dishonesty of the few and the credulity of the many;
and that, according to Matthew, Mark, and Luke, salvation does not
depend upon belief, nor the atonement, nor a "second birth," but that
these gospels are in exact harmony with the declaration of the great
Persian: "Taking the first footstep with the good thought, the second
with the good word, and the third with the good deed, I entered
paradise."The dogmas of the past no longer reach the level of the
highest thought, nor satisfy the hunger of the heart.While dusty
faiths, embalmed and sepulchered in ancient texts, remain the same,
the sympathies of men enlarge; the brain no longer kills its young; the
happy lips give liberty to honest thoughts; the mental firmament expands
and lifts; the broken clouds drift by; the hideous dreams, the foul,
misshapen children of the monstrous night, dissolve and fade.Man the Author of all Books

So far as we know, man is the author of all books.If a book had been
found on the earth by the first man, he might have regarded it as the
work of God; but as men were here a good while before any books were
found, and as man has produced a great many books, the probability is
that the Bible is no exception.God and Brahma

Can we believe that God ever said of any: "Let his children be
fatherless and his wife a widow; let his children be continually
vagabonds, and beg; let them seek their bread also out of their desolate
places; let the extortioner catch all that he hath and let the stranger
spoil his labor, let there be none to extend mercy unto him, neither let
there be any to favor his fatherless children."If he ever said these
words, surely he had never heard this line, this strain of music, from
the Hindu: "Sweet is the lute to those who have not heard the prattle of
their own children."Jehovah, "from the clouds and darkness of Sinai,"
said to the Jews: "Thou shalt have no other gods before me.... Thou
shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them; for I, the Lord thy
God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the
children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me."Contrast this with the words put by the Hindu in the mouth of Brahma:
"I am the same to all mankind.They who honestly serve other gods,
involuntarily worship me.I am he who partaketh of all worship, and I
am the reward of all worshipers."The first, a
dungeon where crawl the things begot of jealous slime; the other, great
as the domed firmament inlaid with suns.Matthew, Mark, and Luke

And I here take occasion to say, that with most of the teachings of the
gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke I most heartily agree.The miraculous
parts must, of course, be thrown aside.I admit that the necessity of
belief, the atonement, and the scheme of salvation are all set forth
in the Gospel of John,--a gospel, in my opinion, not written until long
after the others.Christianity Takes no Step in Advance

All the languages of the world have not words of horror enough to
paint the agonies of man when the church had power.Tiberius, Caligula,
Claudius, Nero, Domitian, and Commodus were not as cruel, false,
and base as many of the Christian Popes.Opposite the names of these
imperial criminals write John the XII., Leo the VIII., Boniface the VII.,
Benedict the IX., Innocent the III., and Alexander the VI.Was it under
these pontiffs that the "church penetrated the moral darkness like a
new sun," and covered the globe with institutions of mercy?Rome was far
better when Pagan than when Catholic.It was better to allow gladiators
and criminals to fight than to burn honest men.The greatest of Romans
denounced the cruelties of the arena.Seneca condemned the combats even
of wild beasts.He was tender enough to say that "we should have a bond
of sympathy for all sentiment beings, knowing that only the depraved
and base take pleasure in the sight of blood and suffering."Aurelius
compelled the gladiators to fight with blunted swords.Roman lawyers
declared that all men are by nature free and equal.Woman, under Pagan
rule in Rome, become as free as man.Zeno, long before the birth of
Christ, taught that virtue alone establishes a difference between men.We know that the Civil Law is the foundation of our codes.We know that
fragments of Greek and Roman art--a few manuscripts saved from Christian
destruction, some inventions and discoveries of the Moors--were the
seeds of modern civilization.Christianity, for a thousand years,
taught memory to forget and reason to believe.Not one step was taken in
advance.Over the manuscripts of philosophers and poets, priests, with
their ignorant tongues thrust out, devoutly scrawled the forgeries of
faith.Christianity a Mixture of Good and Evil

Mr.Black attributes to me the following expression: "Christianity is
pernicious in its moral effect, darkens the mind, narrows the soul,
arrests the progress of human society, and hinders civilization."Strange, that he is only able to answer what I did
not say.I endeavored to show that the passages in the Old Testament
upholding slavery, polygamy, wars of extermination, and religious
intolerance had filled the world with blood and crime.I admitted
that there are many wise and good things in the Old Testament.I also
insisted that the doctrine of the atonement--that is to say, of moral
bankruptcy--the idea that a certain belief is necessary to salvation,
and the frightful dogma of eternal pain, had narrowed the soul, had
darkened the mind, and had arrested the progress of human society.Like
other religions, Christianity is a mixture of good and evil.The church
has made more orphans than it has fed.It has never built asylums enough
to hold the insane of its own making.Jehovah, Epictetus and Cicero

If the Bible is really inspired, Jehovah commanded the Jewish people to
buy the children of the strangers that sojourned among them, and ordered
that the children thus bought should be an inheritance for the children
of the Jews, and that they should be bondmen and bondwomen forever.Yet
Epictetus, a man to whom no revelation was ever made, a man whose soul
followed only the light of nature, and who had never heard of the Jewish
God, was great enough to say: "Will you not remember that your servants
are by nature your brothers, the children of God?In saying that you
have bought them, you look down on the earth and into the pit, on the
wretched law of men long since dead,--but you see not the laws of the
Gods."We find that Jehovah, speaking to his chosen people, assured them
that their bondmen and bondmaids must be "of the heathen that were
round about them.""Of them," said Jehovah, "shall ye buy bondmen
and bondmaids."And yet Cicero, a pagan, Cicero, who had never been
enlightened by reading the Old Testament, had the moral grandeur to
declare: "They who say that we should love our fellow-citizens, but not
foreigners, destroy the universal brotherhood of mankind, with which
benevolence and justice would perish forever."The Atonement

In countless ways the Christian world has endeavored, for nearly two
thousand years, to explain the atonement, and every effort has ended in
an an mission that it cannot be understood, and a declaration that it
must be believed.Is it not immoral to teach that man can sin, that he
can harden his heart and pollute his soul, and that, by repenting
and believing something that he does not comprehend, he can avoid the
consequences of his crimes?Has the promise and hope of forgiveness ever
prevented the commission of a sin?Should men be taught that sin gives
happiness here; that they ought to bear the evils of a virtuous life in
this world for the sake of joy in the next; that they can repent between
the last sin and the last breath; that after repentance every stain
of the soul is washed away by the innocent blood of another; that the
serpent of regret will not hiss in the ear of memory; that the saved
will not even pity the victims of their own crimes; that the goodness
of another can be transferred to them; and that sins forgiven cease to
affect the unhappy wretches sinned against?Sin as a Debt

The Church says that the sinner is in debt to God, and that the
obligation is discharged by the Saviour.The best that can possibly be
said of such a transaction is, that the debt is transferred, not paid.The truth is, that a sinner is in debt to the person he has injured.If a man injures his neighbor, it is not enough for him to get the
forgiveness of God, but he must have the forgiveness of his neighbor.If a man puts his hand in the fire and God forgives him, his hand will
smart exactly the same.You must, after all, reap what you sow.No god
can give you wheat when you sow tares, and no devil can give you tares
when you sow wheat.The Logic of the Coffin

As to the doctrine of the atonement, Mr.Black has nothing to offer
except the barren statement that it is believed by the wisest and the
best.A Mohammedan, speaking in Constantinople, will say the same of the
Koran.A Brahman, in a Hindu temple, will make the same remark, and so
will the American Indian, when he endeavors to enforce something upon
the young of his tribe.He will say: "The best, the greatest of our
tribe have believed in this."This is the argument of the cemetery, the
philosophy of epitaphs, the logic of the coffin.We are the greatest and
wisest and most virtuous of mankind?This statement, that it has been
believed by the best, is made in connection with an admission that it
cannot be fathomed by the wisest.It is not claimed that a thing is
necessarily false because it is not understood, but I do claim that
it is not necessarily true because it cannot be comprehended.I still
insist that "the plan of redemption," as usually preached, is absurd,
unjust, and immoral.Judas Iscariot

For nearly two thousand years Judas Iscariot has been execrated by
mankind; and yet, if the doctrine of the atonement is true, upon his
treachery hung the plan of salvation.Suppose Judas had known of this
plan--known that he was selected by Christ for that very purpose, that
Christ was depending on him.And suppose that he also knew that only
by betraying Christ could he save either himself or others; what ought
Judas to have done?Are you willing to rely upon an argument that
justifies the treachery of that wretch?The Standard of Right

According to Mr.Black, the man who does not believe in a supreme being
acknowledges no standard of right and wrong in this world, and therefore
can have no theory of rewards and punishments in the next.Is it
possible that only those who believe in the God who persecuted for
opinion's sake have any standard of right and wrong?Were the greatest
men of all antiquity without this standard?In the eyes of intelligent
men of Greece and Rome, were all deeds, whether good or evil, morally
alike?Is it necessary to believe in the existence of an infinite
intelligence before you can have any standard of right and wrong?Is it
possible that a being cannot be just or virtuous unless he believes in
some being infinitely superior to himself?If this doctrine be true, how
can God be just or virtuous?Does He believe in some being superior to
himself?If man were incapable of suffering, if man could not
feel pain, the word "conscience" never would have passed his lips.The
man who puts himself in the place of another, whose imagination has been
cultivated to the point of feeling the agonies suffered by another, is
the man of conscience.Black says, "We have neither jurisdiction or capacity to rejudge
the justice of God."In other words, we have no right to think upon
this subject, no right to examine the questions most vitally affecting
human-kind.We are simply to accept the ignorant statements of barbarian
dead.This question cannot be settled by saying that "it would be a
mere waste of time and space to enumerate the proofs which show that the
universe was created by a pre-existent and self-conscious being."The
time and space should have been "wasted," and the proofs should have
been enumerated.These "proofs" are what the wisest and greatest are
trying to find.It cares nothing
for the opinions of the "great," nothing for the prejudices of the many,
and least of all, for the superstitions of the dead.In the world of
science--a fact is a legal tender.Assertions and miracles are base and
spurious coins.We have the right to rejudge the justice even of a god.No one should throw away his reason--the fruit of all experience.It is
the intellectual capital of the soul, the only light, the only guide,
and without it the brain becomes the palace of an idiot king, attended
by a retinue of thieves and hypocrites.The Liberty of the Bible

This is the religious liberty of the Bible.If you had lived in
Palestine, and if the wife of your bosom, dearer to you than your
own soul, had said: "I like the religion of India better than that of
Palestine," it would have been your duty to kill her."Your eye must not
pity her, your hand must be first upon her, and afterwards the hand of
all the people."If she had said: "Let us worship the sun--the sun that
clothes the earth in garments of green--the sun, the great fireside of
the world--the sun that covers the hills and valleys with flowers--that
gave me your face, and made it possible for me to look into the eyes
of my babe,--let us worship the sun," it was your duty to kill her.You
must throw the first stone, and when against her bosom--a bosom filled
with love for you--you had thrown the jagged and cruel rock, and had
seen the red stream of her life oozing from the dumb lips of death,
you could then look up and receive the congratulations of the God whose
commandment you had obeyed.Is it possible that a being of infinite
mercy ordered a husband to kill his wife for the crime of having
expressed, an opinion on the subject of religion?Has there been found
upon the records of the savage world anything more perfectly fiendish
than this commandment of Jehovah?This is justified on the ground that
"blasphemy was a breach of political allegiance, and idolatry an act of
overt treason."We can understand how a human king stands in need of the
service of his people.We can understand how the desertion of any of
his soldiers weakens his army; but were the king infinite in power,
his strength would still remain the same, and under no conceivable
circumstances could the enemy triumph.Slavery in Heaven

According to Mr.Black, there will be slavery in Heaven, and fast by
the throne of God will be the auction-block, and the streets of the New
Jerusalem will be adorned with the whipping-post, while the music of
the harp will be supplemented by the crack of the driver's whip.Black, "incorporate him into his family,
tame him, teach him to think, and give him a knowledge of the true
principles of human liberty and government, he would confer upon him a
most beneficent boon."Black is too late with his protest against
the freedom of his fellow-men.Liberty is making the tour of the world.Russia has emancipated her serfs; the slave trade is prosecuted only
by thieves and pirates; Spain feels upon her cheek the burning blush
of shame; Brazil, with proud and happy eyes, is looking for the dawn of
freedom's day; the people of the South rejoice that slavery is no more,
and every good and honest man (excepting Mr.Black) of every land and
clime hopes that the limbs of men will never feel again the weary weight
of chains.Jehovah Breaking His Own Laws

A very curious thing about these Commandments is that their supposed
author violated nearly every one.From Sinai, according to the account,
He said: "Thou shalt not kill," and yet He ordered the murder of
millions; "Thou shalt not commit adultery," and He gave captured maidens
to gratify the lust of captors; "Thou shalt not steal," and yet He gave
to Jewish marauders the flocks and herds of others; "Thou shalt not
covet thy neighbor's house, nor his wife," and yet He allowed His chosen
people to destroy the homes of neighbors and to steal their wives;
"Honor thy father and mother," and yet this same God had thousands of
fathers butchered, and with the sword of war killed children yet unborn;
"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor," and yet
He sent abroad "lying spirits" to deceive His own prophets, and in a
hundred ways paid tribute to deceit.So far as we know, Jehovah kept
only one of these Commandments--He worshiped no other god.I know as little as anyone else about the "pla" of the universe; and as
to the "design," I know just as little.It will not do to say that the
universe was designed, and therefore there must be a designer.There
must first be proof that it was "designed."It will not do to say that
the universe has a "plan," and then assert that there must have been an
infinite maker.The idea that a design must have a beginning, and that a
designer need not, is a simple expression of human ignorance.We find
a watch, and we say: "So curious and wonderful a thing must have had a
maker."We find the watchmaker, and we say: "So curious and wonderful a
thing as man must have had a maker."We find God and we then say: "He is
so wonderful that he must _not_ have had a maker."In other words, all
things a little wonderful must have been created, but it is possible for
something to be so wonderful that it always existed.One would suppose
that just as the wonder increased the necessity for a creator increased,
because it is the wonder of the thing that suggests the idea of
creation.Is it possible that a designer exists from all eternity
without design?Was there no design in having an infinite designer?For
me, it is hard to see the plan or design in earthquakes and pestilences.It is somewhat difficult to discern the design or the benevolence in so
making the world that billions of animals live only on the agonies of
others.The justice of God is not visible to me in the history of this
world.When I think of the suffering and death, of the poverty and
crime, of the cruelty and malice, of the heartlessness of this "design"
and "plan," where beak and claw and tooth tear and rend the quivering
flesh of weakness and despair, I cannot convince myself that it is the
result of infinite wisdom, benevolence, and justice.What we Know of the Infinite

Of course, upon a question like this, nothing can be absolutely known.We live on an atom called Earth, and what we know of the infinite is
almost infinitely limited; but, little as we know, all have an equal
right to give their honest thought.Life is a shadowy, strange,
and winding road on which we travel for a little way--a few short
steps--just from the cradle, with its lullaby of love, to the low and
quiet wayside inn, where all at last must sleep, and where the only
salutation is--Good-night.The Universe Self-Existent

The universe, according to my idea, is, always was, and forever will
be.It did not "come into being;" it is the one eternal being--the only
thing that ever did, does, or can exist.We know nothing of what we call the laws of Nature except as we gather
the idea of law from the uniformity of phenomena springing from like
conditions.To make myself clear: Water always runs down hill.The
theist says that this happens because there is behind the phenomenon an
active law.As a matter of fact law is this side of the phenomenon.Law
does not cause the phenomenon, but the phenomenon causes the idea of law
in our minds, and this idea is produced from the fact that under like
circumstances the same phenomena always happens.Black probably
thinks that the difference in the weight of rocks and clouds was created
by law; that parallel lines fail to imite only because it is illegal;
that diameter and circumference could have been so made that it would
be a greater distance across than around a circle, that a straight line
could inclose a triangle if not prevented by law, and that a little
legislation could make it possible for two bodies to occupy the same
space at the same time.It seems to me that law can not be the cause of
phenomena, but it is an effect produced in our minds by their succession
and resemblance.To put a God back of the universe compels us to admit
that there was a time when nothing existed except this God; that this
God had lived from eternity in an infinite vacuum and in an absolute
idleness.The mind of every thoughtful man is forced to one of these two
conclusions, either that the universe is self-existent or that it
was created by a self-existent being.To my mied there are far more
difficulties in the second hypothesis than in the first.Jehovah's Promise Broken

If Jehovah was in fact God, He knew the end from the beginning.He knew
that his Bible would be a breastwork behind which tyranny and hypocrisy
would crouch; that it would be quoted by tyrants; that it would be the
defense of robbers called kings and of hypocrites called priests.He
knew that He had taught the Jewish people but little of importance.He
knew that He found them free and left them captives.He knew that He
had never fulfilled the promises made to them.He knew that while other
nations had advanced in art and science his chosen people were savage
still.He promised them the world, and gave them a desert.He promised
them liberty, and He made them slaves.He promised them victory, and He
gave them defeat.He said they should be kings, and He made them
serfs.He promised them universal empire, and gave them exile.When one
finishes the Old Testament, he is compelled to say: Nothing can add to
the misery of a nation whose King is Jehovah!Character Bather than Creed

For a thousand years the torch of progress was extinguished in the blood
of Christ, and His disciples, moved by ignorant zeal, by insane, cruel
creeds, destroyed with flame and sword a hundred millions of their
fellow-men.But if cathedrals had been
universities--if dungeons of the Inquisition had been laboratories--if
Christians had believed in character instead of creed--if they had taken
from the Bible all the good and thrown away the wicked and absurd--if
domes of temples had been observatories--if priests had been
philosophers--if missionaries had taught the useful arts--if astrology
had been astronomy--if the black art had been chemistry--if superstition
had been science--if religion had been humanity--it would have been a
heaven filled with love, with liberty, and joy.Mohammed the Prophet of God

Mohammed was a poor man, a driver of camels.He was without education,
without influence, and without wealth, and yet in a few years he
consolidated thousands of tribes, and millions of men confess that there
is "one God, and Mohammed is his prophet."His success was a thousand
times greater during his life than that of Christ.He was not crucified;
he was a conqueror."Of all men, he exercised the greatest influence
upon the human race."Never in the world's history did a religion
spread with the rapidity of his.It burst like a storm over the fairest
portions of the globe.Black is right in his position that
rapidity is secured only by the direct aid of the Divine Being,
then Mohammed was most certainly the prophet of God.As to wars of
extermination and slavery, Mohammed agreed with Mr.Black, and upon
polygamy with Jehovah.As to religious toleration, he was great enough
to say that "men holding to any form of faith might be saved, provided
they were virtuous."In this he was far in advance both of Jehovah and
Mr.Wanted!--A Little More Legislation

We are informed by Mr.Black that "polygamy is neither commanded or
prohibited in the Old Testament--that it is only discouraged."It seems
to me that a little legislation on that subject might have tended to its
"discouragement."Black assures us "consists of certain immutable rules to govern the
conduct of all men at all times and at all places in their private and
personal relations with others," not one word is found on the subject of
polygamy.There is nothing "discouraging" in the Ten Commandments, nor
in the records of any conversation Jehovah is claimed to have had with
Moses upon Sinai.The life of Abraham, the story of Jacob and Laban,
the duty of a brother to be the husband of the widow of his deceased
brother, the life of David, taken in connection with the practice of
one who is claimed to have been the wisest of men--all these things are
probably relied on to show that polygamy was at least "discouraged."Certainly Jehovah had time to instruct Moses as to the infamy of
polygamy.He could have spared a few moments from a description of
patterns of tongs and basins for a subject so important as this.A
few-words in favor of the one wife and one husband--in favor of the
virtuous and loving home--might have taken the place of instructions
as to cutting the garments of priests and fashioning candlesticks and
ounces of gold.If he had left out simply the order that rams' skins
should be dyed red, and in its place had said, "A man shall have but one
wife, and the wife but one husband," how much better it would have been.Again, it is urged that "the acceptance of Christianity by a large
portion of the generation contemporary with its Founder and His
Apostles, was under the circumstances, an adjudication as solemn and
authoritative as mortal intelligence could pronounce."If this is true,
then "the acceptance of Buddhism by a large portion of the generation
contemporary with its Founder was an adjudication as solemn and
authoritative as mortal intelligence could pronounce."The same could
be said of Mohammedanism, and, in fact, of every religion that has
ever benefited or cursed this world.This argument, when reduced to its
simplest form, is this: All that succeeds is inspired.The Morality in Christianity

The morality in Christianity has never opposed the freedom of thought.It has never put, nor tended to put, a chain on a human mind, nor a
manacle on a human limb; but the doctrines distinctively Christian--the
necessity of believing a certain thing; the idea that eternal punishment
awaited him who failed to believe; the idea that the innocent can suffer
for the guilty--these things have |opposed, and for a thousand years
substantially destroyed the freedom of the human mind.All religions
have, with ceremony, magic, and mystery, deformed, darkened, and
corrupted, the soul.Around the sturdy oaks of morality have grown and
clung the parasitic, poisonous vines of the miraculous and monstrous.Irenaeus assures us that all Christians possessed the power of
working miracles; that they prophesied, cast out devils, healed the
sick, and even raised the dead.Epiphanius asserts that some rivers
and fountains were annually transmuted into wine, in attestation of the
miracle of Cana, adding that he himself had drunk of these fountains.Augustine declares that one was told in a dream where the bones of
St.Stephen were buried and the bones were thus discovered and brought
to Hippo, and that they raised five dead persons to life, and that in
two years seventy miracles were performed with these relics.Justin
Martyr states that God once sent some angels to guard the human race,
that these angels fell in love with the daughters of men, and became the
fathers of innumerable devils.For hundreds of years miracles were
about the only things that happened.They were wrought by thousands of
Christians, and testified to by millions.The saints and martyrs, the
best and greatest, were the witnesses and workers of wonders.Even
heretics, with the assistance of the devil, could suspend the "laws
of nature."Must we believe these wonderful accounts because they were
written by "good men," by Christians," who made their statements in the
presence and expectation of death"?The truth is that these "good men"
were mistaken.They fed their minds on prodigies, and their imaginations
feasted on effects without causes.Doubts were regarded as "rude disturbers of the congregation."Credulity
and sanctity walked hand in hand.As the philosophy of the ancients was rendered almost worthless by the
credulity of the common people, so the proverbs of Christ, his religion
of forgiveness, his creed of kindness, were lost in the mist of miracle
and the darkness of superstition.The Honor Due to Christ

For the man Christ--for the reformer who loved his fellow-men--for the
man who believed in an Infinite Father, who would shield the innocent
and protect the just--for the martyr who expected to be rescued from the
cruel cross, and who at last, finding that his rope was dust, cried out
in the gathering gloom of death; "My God!--for that great and suffering man, mistaken though he was, I have
the highest admiration and respect.That man did not, as I believe,
claim a miraculous origin; he did not pretend to heal the sick nor raise
the dead.He claimed simply to be a man, and taught his fellow-men
that love is stronger far than hate.His life was written by reverent
ignorance.Loving credulity belittled his career with feats of jugglery
and magic art, and priests wishing to persecute and slay, put in his
mouth the words of hatred and revenge.The theological Christ is the
impossible union of the human and divine--man with the attributes of
God, and God with the limitations and weakness of man.Christianity has no Monopoly in Morals

The morality of the world is not distinctively Christian.Zoroaster,
Gautama, Mohammed, Confucius, Christ, and, in fact, all founders of
religions, have said to their disciples: You must not steal; You must
not murder; You must not bear false witness; You must discharge your
obligations.Christianity is the ordinary moral code, _plus_ the
miraculous origin of Jesus Christ, his crucifixion, his resurrection,
his ascension, the inspiration of the Bible, the doctrine of the
atonement, and the necessity of belief.Buddhism is the ordinary moral
code, _plus_ the miraculous illumination of Buddha, the performance of
certain ceremonies, a belief in the transmigration of the soul, and
in the final absorption of the human by the infinite.The religion of
Mohammed is the ordinary moral code, _plus_ the belief that Mohammed
was the prophet of God, total abstinence from the use of intoxicating
drinks, a harem for the faithful here and hereafter, ablutions, prayers,
alms, pilgrimages, and fasts.Old Age in Superstition's Lap

And here I take occasion to thank Mr.Black for having admitted that
Jehovah gave no commandment against the practice of polygamy, that he
established slavery, waged wars of extermination, and persecuted for
opinions' sake even unto death, Most theologians endeavor to putty,
patch, and paint the wretched record of inspired crime, but Mr.Black
has been bold enough and honest enough to admit the truth.In this age
of fact and demonstration it is refreshing to find a man who believes
so thoroughly in the monstrous and miraculous, the impossible and
immoral--who still clings lovingly to the legends of the bib and
rattle--who through the bitter experiences of a wicked world has kept
the credulity of the cradle, and finds comfort and joy in thinking about
the Garden of Eden, the subtile serpent, the flood, and Babel's tower,
stopped by the jargon of a thousand tongues--who reads with happy eyes
the story of the burning brimstone storm that fell upon the cities
of the plain, and smilingly explains the transformation of the
retrospective Mrs.Lot--who laughs at Egypt's plagues and Pharaoh's
whelmed and drowning hosts--eats manna with the wandering Jews, warms
himself at the burning bush, sees Korah's company by the hungry earth
devoured, claps his wrinkled hands with glee above the heathens'
butchered babes, and longingly looks back to the patriarchal days of
concubines and slaves.How touching when the learned and wise crawl back
in cribs and ask to hear the rhymes and fables once again!How charming
in these hard and scientific times to see old age in Superstition's lap,
with eager lips upon her withered breast!Ararat in Chicago

A little while ago, in the city of Chicago, a gentleman addressed a
number of Sunday-school children.In his address he stated that some
people were wicked enough to deny the story of the deluge; that he was
a traveler; that he had been to the top of Mount Ararat, and had brought
with him a stone from that sacred locality.The children were then
invited to form in procession and walk by the pulpit, for the purpose of
seeing this wonderful stone.After they had looked at it, the lecturer
said: "Now, children, if you ever hear anybody deny the story of the
deluge, or say that the ark did not rest on Mount Ararat, you can tell
them that you know better, because you have seen with your own eyes a
stone from that very mountain."How Gods and Devils are Made

It was supposed that God demanded worship; that he loved to be
flattered; that he delighted in sacrifice; that nothing made him happier
than to see ignorant faith upon its knees; that above all things he
hated and despised doubters and heretics, and regarded investigation as
rebellion.Each community felt it a duty to see that the enemies of God
were converted or killed.To allow a heretic to live in peace was
to invite the wrath of God.Every public evil--every misfortune--was
accounted for by something the community had permitted or done.When
epidemics appeared, brought by ignorance and welcomed by filth, the
heretic was brought out and sacrificed to appease the anger of God.By putting intention behind what man called good, God was produced.By
putting intention behind what man called bad, the Devil was created.Leave this "intention" out, and gods and devils fade away.If not a
human being existed, the sun would continue to shine, and tempest now
and then would devastate the earth; the rain would fall in pleasant
showers; violets would spread their velvet bosoms to the sun, the
earthquake would devour, birds would sing, and daisies bloom, and
roses blush, and volcanoes fill the heavens with their lurid glare; the
procession of the seasons would not be broken, and the stars would shine
as serenely as though the world were filled with loving hearts and happy
homes.The Romance of Figures

How long, according to the universal benevolence of the New Testament,
can a man be reasonably punished in the next world for failing to
believe something unreasonable in this?Can it be possible that any
punishment can endure forever?Suppose that every flake of snow that
ever fell was a figure nine, and that the first flake was multiplied by
the second, and that product by the third, and so on to the last flake.And then suppose that this total should be multiplied by every drop of
rain that ever fell, calling each drop a figure nine; and that total by
each blade of grass that ever helped to weave a carpet for the earth,
calling each blade a figure nine; and that again by every grain of sand
on every shore, so that the grand total would make a line of nines so
long that it would require millions upon millions of years for light,
traveling at the rate of one hundred and eighty-five thousand miles per
second, to reach the end.And suppose, further, that each unit in this
almost infinite total, stood for billions of ages--still that vast and
almost endless time, measured by all the years beyond, is as one flake,
one drop, one leaf, one blade, one grain, compared with all the flakes,
and drops, and leaves, and blades and grains.Upon love's breast the
Church has placed the eternal asp.And yet, in the same book in which is
taught this most infamous of doctrines, we are assured that "The Lord is
good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works."God and Zeno

If the Bible is inspired, Jehovah, God of all worlds, actually said:
"And if a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod, and he die under
his hand, he shall be surely punished; notwithstanding, if he continue
a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his money."And yet
Zeno, founder of the Stoics, centuries before Christ was born, insisted
that no man could be the owner of another, and that the title was bad,
whether the slave had become so by conquest, or by purchase.Jehovah,
ordered a Jewish general to make war, and gave, among others, this
command: "When the Lord thy God shall drive them before thee, thou shalt
smite them and utterly destroy them."And yet Epictetus, whom we have
already quoted, gave this marvelous rule for the guidance of human
conduct: "Live with thy inferiors as thou wouldst have thy superiors
live with thee."If Christ was in fact God, he knew all the future.Before him, like a
panorama, moved the history yet to be.He knew exactly how his words
would be interpreted.He knew what crimes, what horrors, what infamies,
would be committed in his name.He knew that the fires of persecution
would climb around the limbs of countless martyrs.He knew that brave
men would languish in dungeons, in darkness, filled with pain; that the
church would use instruments of torture, that his followers would appeal
to whip and chain.He must have seen the horizon of the future red with
the flames of the _auto da fe_.He knew all the creeds that would spring
like poison fungi from every text.He saw the sects waging war against
each other.He saw thousands of men, under the orders of priests,
building dungeons for their fellow-men.He heard the groans, saw the faces white with agony, the tears,
the blood--heard the shrieks and sobs of all the moaning, martyred
multitudes.He knew that commentaries would be written on his words with
swords, to be read by the light of fagots.He knew that the Inquisition
would be born of teachings attributed to him.He saw all the
interpolations and falsehoods that hypocrisy would write and tell.He
knew that above these fields of death, these dungeons, these burnings,
for a thousand years would float the dripping banner of the cross.He
knew that in his name his followers would trade in human flesh, that
cradles would be robbed and women's breasts unbabed for gold;--and yet
he died with voiceless lips.Why did he not
tell his disciples, and through them the world, that man should not
persecute, for opinion's sake, his fellow-man?Why did he not cry, You
shall not persecute in my name; you shall not burn and torment those who
differ from you in creed?Why did he not plainly say, I am the Son of
God?Why did he not explain the doctrine of the trinity?Why did he not
tell the manner of baptism that was pleasing to him?Why did he not say
something positive, definite, and satisfactory about another world?Why
did he not turn the tear-stained hope of heaven to the glad knowledge
of another life?Why did he go dumbly to his death, leaving the world to
misery and to doubt?The Philosophy of Action

Consequences determine the quality of an action.If consequences are
good, so is the action.If actions had no consequences, they would be
neither good nor bad.Man did not get his knowledge of the consequences
of actions from God, but from experience and reason.If man can, by
actual experiment, discover the right and wrong of actions, is it not
utterly illogical to declare that they who do not believe in God can
have no standard of right and wrong?Consequences are the standard by
which actions are judged.They are the children that testify as to the
real character of their parents.God or no God, larceny is the enemy of
industry--industry is the mother of prosperity--prosperity is a good,
and therefore larceny is an evil.God or no God, murder is a crime.There has always been a law against larceny, because the laborer wishes
to enjoy the fruit of his toil.As long as men object to being killed,
murder will be illegal.I have insisted, and I still insist, that it is still impossible for
a finite man to commit a crime deserving infinite punishment; and upon
this subject Mr.Black admits that "no revelation has lifted the veil
between time and eternity;" and, consequently, neither the priest nor
the "policeman" knows anything with certainty regarding another world.He simply insists that "in shadowy figures we are warned that a very
marked distinction will be made between the good and bad in the next
world."There is "a very marked distinction" in this; but there is this
rainbow in the darkest human cloud: The worst have hope of reform.All I
insist is, if there is another life, the basest soul that finds its way
to that dark or radiant shore will have the everlasting chance of
doing right.Nothing but the most cruel ignorance, the most heartless
superstition, the most ignorant theology, ever imagined that the
few days of human life spent here, surrounded by mists and clouds of
darkness, blown over life's sea by storms and tempests of passion, fixed
for all eternity the condition of the human race.If this doctrine be
true, this life is but a net, in which Jehovah catches souls for hell.We are told that "there is no good reason to doubt that the statements
of the Evangelists, as we have them now, are genuine."The fact is, no
one knows who made the "statements of the Evangelists."There are three
important manuscripts upon which the Christian world relies."The first
appeared in the catalogue of the Vatican, in 1475.Of the New, it contains the four gospels,--the Acts, the
seven Catholic Epistles, nine of the Pauline Epistles, and the
Epistle to the Hebrews, so far as the fourteenth verse of the ninth
chapter,"--and nothing more."The
second, the Alexandrine, was presented to King Charles the First, in
1628.It contains the Old and New Testaments, with some exceptions;
passages are wanting in Matthew, in John, and in II.It
also contains the Epistle of Clemens Romanus, a letter of Athanasius,
and the treatise of Eusebius on the Psalms."The last is the Sinaitic
Codex, discovered about 1850, at the Convent of St."It contains the Old and New Testaments, and in addition
the entire Epistle of Barnabas, and a portion of the Shepherd of
Hennas--two books which, up to the beginning of the fourth century, were
looked upon by many as Scripture."In this manuscript, or codex, the
gospel of St.Mark concludes with the eighth verse of the sixteenth
chapter, leaving out the frightful passage: "Go ye into all the world,
and preach the gospel to every creature.He that believeth and is
baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned."In
matters of the utmost importance these manuscripts disagree, but even if
they all agreed it would not furnish the slightest evidence of their
truth.It will not do to call the statements made in the gospels
"depositions," until it is absolutely established who made them, and the
circumstances under which they were made.Neither can we say that "they
were made in the immediate prospect of death," until we know who made
them.It is absurd to say that "the witnesses could not have been
mistaken, because the nature of the facts precluded the possibility of
any delusion about them."Can it be pretended that the witnesses could
not have been mistaken about the relation the Holy Ghost is alleged to
have sustained to Jesus Christ?Is there no possibility of delusion
about a circumstance of that kind?Did the writers of the four gospels
have "the sensible and true avouch of their own eyes and ears" in that
behalf?How was it possible for any one of the four Evangelists to know
that Christ was the Son of God, or that he was God?Matthew says that an angel of the Lord told
Joseph in a dream, but Joseph never wrote an account of this wonderful
vision.Luke tells us that the angel had a conversation with Mary, and
that Mary told Elizabeth, but Elizabeth never wrote a word.There is no
account of Mary, or Joseph, or Elizabeth, or the angel, having had any
conversation with Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John, in which one word was
said about the miraculous origin of Jesus Christ.The persons who knew
did not write, so that the account is nothing but hearsay.Black pretend that such statements would be admitted as evidence in any
court?But how do we know that the disciples of Christ wrote a word of
the gospels?How do we know
that the writers of the gospels "were men of unimpeachable character?"Black's Admission

For the purpose of defending the character of his infallible God, Mr.Black is forced to defend religious intolerance, wars of extermination,
human slavery, and almost polygamy.He admits that God established
slavery; that he commanded his chosen people to buy the children of the
heathen; that heathen fathers and mothers did right to sell their girls
and boys; that God ordered the Jews to wage wars of extermination and
conquest; that it was right to kill the old and young; that God forged
manacles for the human brain; that he commanded husbands to murder their
wives for suggesting the worship of the sun or moon; and that every
cruel, savage passage in the Old Testament was inspired by him.Such is
a "policeman's" view of God.The Stars Upon the Door of France

Mr.Black justifies all the crimes and horrors, excuses all the tortures
of all the Christian years, by denouncing the cruelties of the French
Revolution.Thinking people will not hasten to admit that an infinitely
good being authorized slavery in Judea, because of the atrocities of the
French Revolution.They will remember the sufferings of the Huguenots.They will not forget
the countless cruelties of priest and king.They will not forget the
dungeons of the Bastile.They will know that the Revolution was an
effect, and that liberty was not the cause--that atheism was not the
cause.Behind the Revolution they will see altar and throne--sword and
fagot--palace and cathedral--king and priest--master and slave--tyrant
and hypocrite.They will see that the excesses, the cruelties, and
crimes were but the natural fruit of seeds the church had sown.Upon that cloud of war, black with
the myriad miseries of a thousand years, dabbled with blood of king and
queen, of patriot and priest, there was this bow: "Beneath the flag of
France all men are free."In spite of all the blood and crime, in spite
of deeds that seem insanely base, the People placed upon a Nation's brow
these stars:--Liberty, Fraternity, Equality--grander words than ever
issued from Jehovah's lips.A KIND WORD FOR JOHN CHINAMAN

On the 27th day of March, 1880, Messrs.Wright, Dickey, O'Conner, and
Murch, of the Select Committee appointed by Congress to "Consider
the causes of the present depression of labor," presented the majority
special report on Chinese Immigration.The following quotations are
excerpts from Col.R. G. Ingersoll's caustic review of that report.The Select Committee Afraid

These gentlemen are in great fear for the future of our most holy and
perfectly authenticated religion, and have, like faithful watchmen,
from the walls and towers of Zion, hastened to give the alarm.They have
informed Congress that "Joss has his temple of worship in the Chinese
quarters, in San Francisco.Within the walls of a dilapidated structure
is exposed to the view of the faithful the God of the Chinaman, and here
are his altars of worship, Here he tears up his pieces of paper; here he
offers up his prayers; here he receives his religious consolations,
and here is his road to the celestial land."That "Joss is located in a
long, narrow room, in a building in a back alley, upon a kind of altar;"
that "he is a wooden image, looking as much like an alligator as like a
human being;" that the Chinese "think there is such a place as heaven;"
that "all classes of Chinamen worship idols;" that "the temple is open
every day at all hours;" that "the Chinese have no Sunday;" that this
heathen god has "huge jaws, a big red tongue, large white teeth, a half
dozen arms, and big, fiery, eyeballs.About him are placed offerings of
meat, and other eatables--a sacrificial offering."The Gods of the Joss-House and Patmos

No wonder that these members of the committee were shocked at such a
god, knowing as they did, that the only true God was correctly described
by the inspired lunatic of Patmos in the following words: "And there sat
in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like unto the Son of
Man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps
with a golden girdle.His head and his hairs were white like wool, as
white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; and his feet like
unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the
sound of many waters.And he had in his right hand seven stars; and out
of his mouth went a sharp, two-edged sword; and his countenance was as
the sun shining in his strength."Certainly, a large mouth, filled
with white teeth, is preferable to one used as the scabbard of a sharp,
two-edged sword.Why should these gentlemen object to a god with big
fiery eyeballs, when their own Deity has eyes like a flame of fire?A Little Too Late

Is it not a little late in the day to object to people because they
sacrifice meat and other eatables to their god?We all know, that for
thousands of years the "real" God was exceedingly fond of roasted meat;
that He loved the savor of burning flesh, and delighted in the perfume
of fresh warm blood.Christianity has a Fair Show in San Francisco

The world is also informed by these gentlemen that "the idolatry of
the Chinese produces a demoralizing effect upon our American youth by
bringing sacred things into disrespect and making religion a theme of
disgust and contempt."In San Francisco there are some three hundred
thousand people.Is it possible that a few Chinese can bring "our holy
religion" into disgust and contempt?In that city there are fifty times
as many churches as joss-houses.Scores of sermons are uttered every
week; religious books and papers are plentiful as leaves in autumn, and
somewhat dryer; thousands of bibles are within the reach of all.An Arrow from the Quiver of Satire

And there, too, is the example of a Christian city.Why should we send
missionaries to China, if we cannot convert the heathen when they come
here?When missionaries go to a foreign land the poor benighted people
have to take their word for the blessings showered upon a Christian
people; but when the heathen come here, they can see for themselves.What was simply a story becomes a demonstrated fact.They come in
contact with people who love their enemies.They see that in a Christian
land men tell the truth; that they will not take advantage of strangers;
that they are just and patient; kind and tender; and have no prejudice
on account of color, race or religion; that they look upon mankind as
brethren; that they speak of God as a Universal Father, and are
willing to work and even to suffer, for the good, not only of their own
countrymen, but of the heathen as well.All this the Chinese see and
know, and why they still cling to the religion of their country is, to
me, a matter of amazement.We Have no Religious System

I take this, the earliest opportunity, to inform these gentlemen
composing a majority of the committee, that we have in the United States
no "religious system;" that this is a secular government.That it has
no religious creed; that it does not believe nor disbelieve in a future
state of reward or punishment; that it neither affirms nor denies the
existence of a "living" God.Congress Nothing to Do with Religion

Congress has nothing to do with the religion of the people.Its members
are not responsible to God for the opinions of their constituents, and
it may tend to the happiness of the constituents for me to state that
they are in no way responsible for the religion of the members.Religion
is an individual, not a national matter.And where the nation interferes
with the right of conscience, the liberties of the people are devoured
by the monster Superstition.But I am astonished that four Christian statesmen, four members of
Congress in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, who seriously
object to people on account of their religious convictions, should
still assert that the very religion in which they believe--and the only
religion established by the living god-head of the American system--is
not adapted to the spiritual needs of one-third of the human race.It is
amazing that these four gentlemen have, in the defense of the Christian
religion, announced the discovery that it is wholly inadequate for
the civilization of mankind; that the light of the cross can never
penetrate the darkness of China; "that all the labors of the missionary,
the example of the good, the exalted character of our civilization, make
no impression upon the pagan life of the Chinese;" and that even
the report of this committee will not tend to elevate, refine and
Christianize the yellow heathen of the Pacific coast.In the name
of religion these gentlemen have denied its power and mocked at the
enthusiasm of its founder.Worse than this, they have predicted for the
Chinese a future of ignorance and idolatry in this world, and, if the
"American system" of religion is true, hell-fire in the next.Do not Trample on John Chinaman

Do not trample upon these people because they have a different
conception of things about which even this committee knows nothing.Give them the same privilege you enjoy of making a God after their own
fashion.Would you be willing
to have them remain, if one of their race, thousands of years ago, had
pretended to have seen God, and had written of him as follows: "There
went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth; coals
were kindled by it, * * * and he rode upon a cherub and did fly."Why
should you object to these people on account of their religion?Your
objection has in it the spirit of hate and intolerance.That spirit lighted the fagot, made the
thumb-screw, put chains upon the limbs, and lashes upon the backs of
men.The same spirit bought and sold, captured and kidnapped human
beings; sold babes, and justified all the horrors of slavery.Be Honest with the Chinese

If you wish to drive out the Chinese, do not make a pretext of religion.Do not pretend that you are trying to do God a favor.Injustice in his
name is doubly detestable.The assassin cannot sanctify his dagger by
falling on his knees, and it does not help a falsehood if it be uttered
as a prayer.Religion, used, to intensify the hatred of men toward men,
under the pretense of pleasing God, has cursed this world.An Honest Merchant the Best Missionary

I am almost sure that I have read somewhere that "Christ died for _all_
men," and that "God is no respecter of persons."It was once taught
that it was the duty of Christians to tell to all people the "tidings of
great joy."I have never believed these things myself, but have always
contended that an honest merchant was the best missionary.Commerce
makes friends, religion makes enemies; the one enriches, and the other
impoverishes; the one thrives best where the truth is told, the other
where falsehoods are believed.For myself, I have but little confidence
in any business, or enterprise, or investment, that promises dividends
only after the death of the stockholders.Good Words from Confucius

For the benefit of these four philosophers and prophets, I will give a
few extracts from the writings of Confucius that will, in my judgment,
compare favorably with the best passages of their report:

"My doctrine is that man must be true to the principles of his nature,
and the benevolent exercises of them toward others.""With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and with my bended arm
for a pillow, I still have joy.""Riches and honor acquired by injustice are to me but floating clouds.""The man who, in view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who, in view of
danger, forgets life; and who remembers an old agreement, however far
back it extends, such a man may be reckoned a complete man.""Recompense injury with justice, and kindness with kindness."There is one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's
life: Reciprocity is that word.The Ancient Chinese

When the ancestors of the four Christian Congressmen were barbarians,
when they lived in caves, gnawed bones, and worshiped dry snakes; the
infamous Chinese were reading these sublime sentences of Confucius.When
the forefathers of these Christian statesmen were hunting toads to
get the jewels out of their heads to be used as charms, the wretched
Chinamen were calculating eclipses, and measuring the circumference
of the earth.When the progenitors of these representatives of the
"American system of religion" were burning women charged with nursing
devils, these people "incapable of being influenced by the exalted
character of our civilization," were building asylums for the insane.The Chinese and Civil Service Reform

Neither should it be forgotten that, for thousands of years, the Chinese
have honestly practised the great principle known as civil service
reform--a something that even the administration of Mr.Hayes has
reached only through the proxy of promise.Invading China in the Name of Opium and Christ

The English battered down the door of China in the names of Opium and
Christ.This infamy was regarded as another triumph of the gospel.At last in self-defense the Chinese allowed Christians to touch their
shores.Their wise men, their philosophers, protested, and prophesied
that time would show that Christians could not be trusted.This re port
proves that the wise men were not only philosophers but prophets.Don't be Dishonest in the Name of God

Treat China as you would England.Change it if you will, according to the laws of nations, but on no
account excuse a breach of national faith by pretending that we are
dishonest for God's sake.CONCERNING CREEDS AND THE TYRANNY OF SECTS




482.Diversity of Opinion Abolished by Henry VIII

In the reign of Henry VIII--that pious and moral founder of the
apostolic Episcopal Church,--there was passed by the parliament
of England an act entitled, "An act for abolishing of diversity of
opinion."And in this act was set forth what a good Christian was
obliged to believe:

First, That in the sacrament was the real body and blood of Jesus
Christ.Second, That the body and blood of Jesus Christ was in the bread, and
the blood and body of Jesus Christ was in the wine.Fourth, That vows of chastity were of perpetual obligation.Fifth, That private masses ought to be continued; and,

Sixth, That auricular confession to a priest must be maintained.This creed was made by law, in order that all men might know just what
to believe by simply reading the statute.The Church hated to see the
people wearing out their brains in thinking upon these subjects.Spencer and Darwin Damned

According to the philosophy of theology, man has continued to degenerate
for six thousand years.To teach that there is that in nature which
impels to higher forms and grander ends, is heresy, of course.The
Deity will damn Spencer and his "Evolution," Darwin and his "Origin
of Species," Bastian and his "Spontaneous Generation," Huxley and his
"Protoplasm," Tyndall and his "Prayer Gauge," and will save those, and
those only, who declare that the universe has been cursed, from the
smallest atom to the grandest star; that everything tends to evil and to
that only, and that the only perfect thing in nature is the Presbyterian
Confession of Faith.The Dead do Not Persecute

Imagine a vine that grows at one end and decays at the other.The
end that grows is heresy, the end that rots is orthodox.The dead are
orthodox, and your cemetery is the most perfect type of a well regulated
church.No thought, no progress, no heresy there.Slowly and silently,
side by side, the satisfied members peacefully decay.There is only this
difference--the dead do not persecute.The Atheist a Legal Outcast in Illinois

The supreme court of Illinois decided, in the year of grace 1856, that
an unbeliever in the existence of an intelligent First Cause could not
be allowed to testify in any court.His wife and children might have
been murdered before his very face, and yet in the absence of other
witnesses, the murderer could not have even been indicted.To him, Justice was not only blind, but deaf.He
was liable, like other men, to support the government, and was forced to
contribute his share towards paying the salaries of the very judges
who decided that under no circumstances could his voice be heard in any
court.This was the law of Illinois, and so remained until the adoption
of the new Constitution By such infamous means has the Church endeavored
to chain the human mind, and protect the majesty of her God.How the Owls Hoot

Now and then somebody examines, and in spite of all keeps his manhood,
and has the courage to follow where his reason leads.Then the pious
get together and repeat wise saws, and exchange knowing nods and most
prophetic winks.The stupidly wise sit owl-like on the dead limbs of the
tree of knowledge, and solemnly hoot.The Fate of Theological Students

Thousands of young men are being educated at this moment by the various
Churches.In order that they may be prepared to investigate
the phenomena by which we are surrounded?The object, and the only
object, is that they may be prepared to defend a creed; that they may
learn the arguments of their respective churches, and repeat them in
the dull ears of a thoughtless congregation.If one, after being thus
trained at the expense of the Methodists, turns Presbyterian or Baptist,
he is denounced as an ungrateful wretch.Honest investigation is utterly
impossible within the pale of any Church, for the reason, that if you
think the Church is right you will not investigate, and if you think it
wrong, the Church will investigate you.The consequence of this is,
that most of the theological literature is the result of suppression, of
fear, tyranny and hypocrisy.Trials for Heresy

A trial for heresy means that the spirit of persecution still lingers in
the Church; that it still denies the right of private judgment; that it
still thinks more of creed than truth, and that it is still determined
to prevent the intellectual growth of man.It means the churches are
shambles in which are bought and sold the souls of men.It means that
the Church is still guilty of the barbarity of opposing thought with
force.It means that if it had the power, the mental horizon would be
bound by a creed; that it would bring again the whips and chains and
dungeon keys, the rack and fagot of the past.Presbyterianism Softening

Fortunately for us, civilization has had a softening effect even upon
the Presbyterian Church.To the ennobling influence of the arts and
sciences the savage spirit of Calvinism has, in some slight degree,
succumbed.True, the old creed remains substantially as it was written,
but by a kind of tacit understanding it has come to be regarded as a
relic of the past.The cry of "heresy" has been growing fainter and
fainter, and, as a consequence, the ministers of that denomination
have ventured, now and then, to express doubts as to the damnation of
infants, and the doctrine of total depravity.The Methodist "Hoist with his own Petard."A few years ago a Methodist clergyman took it upon himself to give me a
piece of friendly advice."Although you may disbelieve the bible," said
he, "you ought not to say so."Do
you believe the bible," said I. He replied, "Most assuredly."To which
I retorted, "Your answer conveys no information to me.You may be
following your own advice.Of
course a man who will advise others to dissimulate will not always be
particular about telling the truth himself."The Precious Doctrine of Total Depravity

What a precious doctrine is that of the total depravity of the human
heart!How sweet it is to believe that the lives of all the good and
great were continual sins and perpetual crimes; that the love a mother
bears her child is, in the sight of God, a sin; that the gratitude of
the natural heart is simple meanness; that the tears of pity are impure;
that for the unconverted to live and labor for others is an offense to
heaven; that the noblest aspirations of the soul are low and groveling
in the sight of God.Guilty of Heresy

Whoever has an opinion of his own, and honestly expresses it, will be
guilty of heresy.Heresy is what the minority believe; it is the name
given by the powerful to the doctrine of the weak.This word was born of
the hatred, arrogance and cruelty of those who love their enemies, and
who, when smitten on one cheek, turn the other.This word was born of
intellectual slavery in the feudal ages of thought.It was an epithet
used in the place of argument.From the commencement of the Christian
era, every art has been exhausted and every conceivable punishment
inflicted to force all people to hold the same religious opinions.This
effort was born of the idea that a certain belief was necessary to the
salvation of the soul.One great trouble is that most teachers are dishonest.They teach as
certainties those things concerning which they entertain doubts.They
do not say, "we _think_ this is so," but "we _know_ this is so."They do
not appeal to the reason of the pupil, but they command his faith.They
keep all doubts to themselves; they do not explain, they assert.In all ages reason has been regarded as the enemy of religion.Nothing
has been considered so pleasing to the Deity as a total denial of the
authority of your own mind.Self-reliance has been thought a deadly
sin; and the idea of living and dying without the aid and consolation
of superstition has always horrified the Church.By some unaccountable
infatuation, belief has been and still is considered of immense
importance.All religions have been based upon the idea that God will
forever reward the true believer, and eternally damn the man who doubts
or denies.Belief is regarded as the one essential thing.To practice
justice, to love mercy, is not enough.You must believe in some
incomprehensible creed.You must say, "Once one is three, and three
times one is one."The man who practiced every virtue, but failed to
believe, was execrated.Nothing so outrages the feelings of the Church
as a moral unbeliever--nothing so horrible as a charitable Atheist.A Hundred and Fifty Years Ago

One hundred and fifty years ago the foremost preachers would have
perished at the stake.A Universalist would have been torn in pieces in
England, Scotland, and America.Unitarians would have found themselves
in the stocks, pelted by the rabble with dead cats, after which their
ears would have been cut off, their tongues bored, and their foreheads
branded.The Despotism of Faith

The despotism of faith is justified upon the ground that Christian
countries are the grandest and most prosperous of the world.At one time
the same thing could have been truly said in India, in Egypt, in Greece,
in Rome, and in every other country that has, in the history of the
world, swept to empire.This argument proves too much not only, but the
assumption upon which it is based is utterly false.Believe, or Beware

And what does a trial for heresy mean?It means that the Church says
a heretic, "Believe as I do, or I will withdraw my support.I will pursue you until your garments are rags; until your
children cry for bread; until your cheeks are furrowed with tears.I
will hunt you to the very portals of the grave."Calvin's Petrified Heart

Luther denounced mental liberty with all the coarse and brutal vigor
of his nature; Calvin despised, from the very bottom of his petrified
heart, anything that even looked like religious toleration, and solemnly
declared that to advocate it was to crucify Christ afresh.All the
founders of all the orthodox churches have advocated the same infamous
tenet.The truth is, that what is called religion is necessarily
inconsistent with free thought.Must one be versed in Latin before he is entitled to express his opinion
as to the genuineness of a pretended revelation from God?Common sense
belongs exclusively to no tongue.Logic is not confined to, nor has it
been buried with, the dead languages.Paine attacked the bible as it is
translated.If the translation is wrong, let its defenders correct it.A gentleman, walking among the ruins of Athens came upon a fallen statue
of Jupiter; making an exceedingly low bow he said: "O Jupiter!He then added: "Should you ever sit upon the throne of heaven
again, do not, I pray you, forget that I treated you politely when you
were prostrate."The Tail of a Lion

There is no saying more degrading than this: "It is better to be the
tail of a lion than the head of a dog."It is a responsibility to think
and act for yourself.Most people hate responsibility; therefore they
join something and become the tail of some lion.They say, "My party
can act for me--my church can do my thinking.It is enough for me to
pay taxes and obey the lion to which I belong, without troubling myself
about the right, the wrong, or the why or the wherefore."While the Preachers Talked the People Slept

The fact is, the old ideas became a little monotonous to the people.The
fall of man, the scheme of redemption and irresistible grace, began
to have a familiar sound.The preachers told the old stories while the
congregations slept.Some of the ministers became tired of these stories
themselves.The five points grew dull, and they felt that nothing short
of irresistible grace could bear this endless repetition.The outside
world was full of progress, and in every direction men advanced, while
the church, anchored to a creed, idly rotted at the shore.Christianity no Friend to Progress

Christianity has always opposed every forward movement of the human
race.Across the highway of progress it has always been building
breastworks of bibles, tracts, commentaries, prayer-books, creeds,
dogmas and platforms, and at every advance the Christians have gathered
together behind these heaps of rubbish and shot the poisoned arrows of
malice at the soldiers of freedom.You may be laughed at in this world for insisting that God put Adam into
a deep sleep and made a woman out of one of his ribs, but you will be
crowned and glorified in the next.You will also have the pleasure of
hearing the gentlemen howl there, who laughed at you here.While you
will not be permitted to take any revenge, you will be allowed to
smilingly express your entire acquiescence in the will of God.The one was lost, and the other has not
been found.The Real Eden is Beyond

Nations and individuals fail and die, and make room for higher forms.The intellectual horizon of the world widens as the centuries pass.Ideals grow grander and purer; the difference between justice and mercy
becomes less and less; liberty enlarges, and love intensifies as the
years sweep on.The ages of force and fear, of cruelty and wrong, are
behind us and the real Eden is beyond.It is said that a desire for
knowledge lost us the Eden of the past; but whether that is true or not,
it will certainly give us the Eden of the future.Party Names Belittle Men

Let us forget that we are Baptists, Methodists, Catholics,
Presbyterians, or Free-thinkers, and remember only that we are men and
women.After all, man and woman are the highest possible titles.All
other names belittle us, and show that we have, to a certain extent,
given up our individuality.A FEW PLAIN QUESTIONS




507.On which of the six days was he
created?Is it possible that God would make a successful
rival?He must have known that Adam and Eve would fall.He knew what
a snake with a "spotted, dappled skin" could do with an inexperienced
woman.He knew that if the serpent
got into the garden, Adam and Eve would sin, that he would have to drive
them out, that afterwards the world would be destroyed, and that he
himself would die upon the cross.Must We Believe Fables to be Good and True?Must we, in order to be
good, gentle and loving in our lives, believe that the creation of woman
was a second thought?That Jehovah really endeavored to induce Adam to
take one of the lower animals as an helpmeet for him?After all, is it
not possible to live honest and courageous lives without believing these
fables?Why was not the serpent kept out of the garden?Why did not the Lord God
take him by the tail and snap his head off?Why did he not put Adam
and Eve on their guard about this serpent?They, of course, were not
acquainted in the neighborhood, and knew nothing about the serpent's
reputation.Questions About the Ark

How was the ark kept clean?We know how it was ventilated; but what
was done with the filth?How were some
portions of the ark heated for animals from the tropics, and others
kept cool for the polar bears?How did the animals get back to their
respective countries?Some had to creep back about six thousand miles,
and they could only go a few feet a day.Some of the creeping things
must have started for the ark just as soon as they were made, and kept
up a steady jog for sixteen hundred years.Think of a couple of the
slowest snails leaving a point opposite the ark and starting for the
plains of Shinar, a distance of twelve thousand miles.Going at the rate
rate of a mile a month, it would take them a thousand years.Polar bears must have gone several thousand miles, and
so sudden a change in climate must have been exceedingly trying upon
their health.Of course, all the polar
bears did not go.It could be confounded only by the
destruction of memory.Did God destroy the memory of mankind at
that time, and if so, how?Did he paralyze that portion of the brain
presiding over the organs of articulation, so that they could not speak
the words, although they remembered them clearly, or did he so touch
the brain that they could not hear?Will some theologian, versed in
the machinery of the miraculous, tell us in what way God confounded the
language of mankind?Would God Kill a Man for Making Ointment?Can we believe that the real God, if there is one, ever ordered a man
to be killed simply for making hair oil, or ointment?We are told in
the thirtieth chapter of Exodus, that the Lord commanded Moses to take
myrrh, cinnamon, sweet calamus, cassia, and olive oil, and make a
holy ointment for the purpose of anointing the tabernacle, tables,
candlesticks and other utensils, as well as Aaron and his sons; saying,
at the same time, that whosoever compounded any like it, or whoever put
any of it on a stranger, should be put to death.In the same chapter,
the Lord furnishes Moses with a recipe for making a perfume, saying,
that whoever should make any which smelled like it, should be cut off
from his people.This, to me, sounds so unreasonable that I cannot
believe it.Some Christians say that the fountains of the great deep were broken up.Will they be kind enough to tell us what the fountains of the great deep
are?Others say that God had vast stores of water in the center of the
earth that he used on the occasion of the flood.How did these waters
happen to run up hill?Would a Real God Uphold Slavery?Must we believe that God called some of his children the money of
others?Can we believe that God made lashes upon the naked back, a
legal tender for labor performed?Must we regard the auction block as an
altar?Were the
stealers and whippers of babes and women the justified children of God?Will some minister, who now believes in religious liberty, and
eloquently denounces the intolerance of Catholicism, explain these
things; will he tell us why he worships an intolerant God?Is a god who
will burn a soul forever in another world, better than a christian who
burns the body for a few hours in this?Do the angels all discuss questions on the same side?Are all the
investigators in perdition?Will the penitent thief, winged and crowned,
laugh at the honest folks in hell?Will the agony of the damned increase
or decrease the happiness of God?Will there be, in the universe, an
eternal _auto da fe_?Why should a believer in God hate an atheist?Surely the atheist has
not injured God, and surely he is human, capable of joy and pain, and
entitled to all the rights of man.Would it not be far better to treat
this atheist, at least, as well as he treats us?ORIENT PEARLS AS RANDOM STRUNG

I do not believe that Christians are as bad as their creeds.The highest crime against a creed is to change it.A believer is a bird in a cage, a free-thinker is an eagle parting the
clouds with tireless wing.All that is good in our civilization is the result of commerce, climate,
soil, geographical position.The heretics have not thought and suffered and died in vain.Every
heretic has been, and is, a ray of light.No man ever seriously attempted to reform a Church without being cast
out and hunted down by the hounds of hypocrisy.After all, the poorest bargain that a human being can make, is to give
his individuality for what is called respectability.On every hand are the enemies of individuality and mental freedom.Custom meets us at the cradle and leaves us only at the tomb.There can be nothing more utterly subversive of all that is really
valuable than the suppression of honest thought.No man, worthy of the form he bears, will at the command of Church or
State solemnly repeat a creed his reason scorns.Although we live in what is called a free government,--and politically
we are free,--there is but little religious liberty in America.According to orthodox logic, God having furnished us with imperfect
minds, has a right to demand a perfect result.Nearly all people stand in great horror of annihilation, and yet to give
up your individuality is to annihilate yourself.When women reason, and babes sit in the lap of philosophy, the victory
of reason over the shadowy host of darkness will be complete.Of all the religions that have been produced by the egotism, the malice,
the ignorance and ambition of man, Presbyterianism is the most hideous.And what man who really thinks can help repeating the words of Ennius:
"If there are gods they certainly pay no attention to the affairs of
man."Events, like the pendulum of a clock have swung forward and backward,
but after all, man, like the hands, has gone steadily on.In spite of Church and dogma, there have been millions and millions of
men and women true to the loftiest and most generous promptings of the
human heart.I was taught to hate Catholicism with every drop of my blood, it is only
justice to say, that in all essential particulars it is precisely the
same as every other religion.Wherever brave blood has been shed, the sword of the Church has been
wet.On every chain has been the sign of the cross.The altar and throne
have leaned against and supported each other.We have all been taught by the Church that nothing is so well calculated
to excite the ire of the Deity as to express a doubt as to his
existence, and that to deny it is an unpardonable sin.Universal obedience is universal stagnation; disobedience is one of the
conditions of progress.Select any age of the world and tell me what
would have been the effect of implicit obedience.We have no national religion, and no national God; but every citizen
is allowed to have a religion and a God of his own, or to reject all
religions and deny the existence of all gods.Whatever may be the truth upon any subject has nothing to do with our
right to investigate that subject, and express any opinion we may form.All that I ask, is the same right I freely accord to all others.Mental slavery is mental death, and every man who has given up his
intellectual freedom is the living coffin of his dead soul.In this
sense, every church is a cemetery and every creed an epitaph.Think of reading the 109th Psalm to a heathen who has a Bible of his own
in which is found this passage: "Blessed is the man and beloved of all
the gods, who is afraid of no man, and of whom no man is afraid."The trouble with most people is, they bow to what is called authority;
they have a certain reverence for the old because it is old.They think
a man is better for being dead, especially if he has been dead a long
time.We should all remember that to be like other people is to be unlike
ourselves, and that nothing can be more detestable in character than
servile imitation.The great trouble with imitation is, that we are apt
to ape those who are in reality far below us.Suppose the Church had had absolute control of the human mind at any
time, would not the words liberty and progress have been blotted from
human speech?In defiance of advice, the world has advanced.Over every fortress of tyranny has waved, and still waves, the banner of
the Church.The Church has won no victories for the rights of man.We have advanced in spite of religious zeal, ignorance, and opposition.Luther labored to reform the Church--Voltaire, to reform men.There have been, and still are, too many men who own themselves--too
much thought, too much knowledge for the Church to grasp again the
sword of power.For the Eg-lon of superstition
Science has a message from Truth.It is a blessed thing that in every age some one has had individuality
enough and courage enough to stand by his own convictions,--some one
who had the grandeur to say his say."The Church says the earth is flat; but I have seen its shadow on the
moon, and I have more confidence even in a shadow than in the Church.""On the prow of his ship were disobedience, defiance, scorn, and
success.INGERSOLL'S ORATION AT HIS BROTHER'S GRAVE

     A Tribute to Ebon C. Ingersoll, by his Brother
     Robert--The Record of a Generous Life Runs
     Like a  Vine Around the Memory of our
     Dead,   and   Every   Sweet,   Unselfish
     Act is Now a Perfumed Flower.Dear Friends: I am going to do that which the dead oft promised he would
do for me.The loved and loving brother, husband, father, friend, died where
manhood's morning almost touches noon, and while the shadows still were
falling toward the west.He had not passed on life's highway the stone that marks the highest
point; but, being weary for a moment, he lay down by the wayside, and,
using his burden for a pillow, fell into that dreamless sleep that
kisses down his eyelids still.While yet in love with life and raptured
with the world, he passed to silence and pathetic dust.Yet, after all, it may be best, just in the happiest, sunniest hour
of all the voyage, while eager winds are kissing every sail, to dash
against the unseen rock, and in an instant hear the billows roar above a
sunken ship For whether in mid sea or '<DW41> the breakers of the farther
shore, a wreck at last must mark the end of each and all.And every
life, no matter if its every hour is rich with love and every moment
jeweled with a joy, will, at its close, become a tragedy as sad and deep
and dark as can be woven of the warp and woof of mystery and death.This brave and tender man in every storm of life was oak and rock; but
in the sunshine he was vine and flower.He was the friend of all heroic
souls.He climbed the heights, and left all superstitions far below,
while on his forehead fell the golden dawning of the grander day.He loved the beautiful, and was with color, form, and music touched to
tears.He sided with the weak, the poor, and wronged, and lovingly
gave alms.With loyal heart and with the purest hands he faithfully
discharged all public trusts.He was a worshiper of liberty, a friend of the oppressed.A thousand
times I have heard him quote these words: "For Justice all place a
temple, and all season, summer."He believed that happiness was the only
good, reason the only torch, justice the only worship, humanity the only
religion, and love the only priest.He added to the sum of human joy;
and were every one to whom he did some loving service to bring a blossom
to his grave, he would sleep to-night beneath a wilderness of sweet
flowers.Life is a narrow vale between the cold and barren peaks of two
eternities.We strive in vain to look beyond the heights.We cry aloud,
and the only answer is the echo of our wailing cry.From the voiceless
lips of the unreplying dead there comes no word; but in the night of
death hope sees a star and listening love can hear the rustle of a wing.He who sleeps here, when dying, mistaking the approach of death for the
return of health, whispered with his latest breath, "I am better now."Let us believe, in spite of doubts and dogmas, of fears and tears, that
these dear words are true of all the countless dead.And now, to you, who have been chosen, from among the many men he loved,
to do the last sad office for the dead, we give his sacred dust.There was, there is, no gentler,
stronger, manlier man.INGERSOLL'S DREAM OF THE WAR

     The Following Words of Matchless Eloquence were
     Addressed by Col.Ingersoll to the Veteran
     Soldiers of Indianapolis.The past, as it were, rises before me like a dream.Again we are in the
great struggle for national life.We hear the sound of preparation--the
music of the boisterous drums--the silver voices of heroic bugles.We
see thousands of assemblages, and hear the appeals of orators; we see
the pale cheeks of women, and the flushed faces of men; and in those
assemblages we see all the dead whose dust we have covered with flowers.We are with them when they enlist in the
great army of freedom.Some are
walking for the last time in quiet, woody places with the maidens they
adore.We hear the whisperings and the sweet vows of eternal love as
they lingeringly part forever.Others are bending over cradles kissing
babes that are asleep.Some are parting with
mothers who hold them and press them to their hearts again and again,
and say nothing; and some are talking with wives, and endeavoring with
brave words spoken in the old tones to drive away the awful fear.We see the wife standing in the door with the babe in her
arms--standing in the sunlight sobbing--at the turn of the road a hand
waves--she answers by holding high in her loving hands the child.We see them all as they march proudly away under the flaunting flags,
keeping time to the wild music of war--marching down the streets of the
great cities--through the towns and across the prairies--down to the
fields of glory, and do and to die for the eternal right.We are by their side on all the gory
fields, in all the hospitals of pain--on all the weary marches.We stand
guard with them in the wild storm and under the quiet stars.We are with
them in ravines running with blood--in the furrows of old fields.We are
with them between contending hosts, unable to move, wild with thirst,
the life ebbing slowly away among the withered leaves.We see them
pierced by balls and torn with shells in the trenches of forts, and in
the whirlwind of the charge, where men become iron with nerves of steel.We are with them in the prisons of hatred and famine, but human speech
can never tell what they endured.We are at home when the news comes that they are dead.We see the maiden
in the shadow of her sorrow.We see the silvered head of the old man
bowed with the last grief.The past rises before us, and we see four millions of human beings
governed by the lash--we see them bound hand and foot--we hear the
strokes of cruel whips--we see the hounds tracking women through
tangled swamps.We see babes sold from the breasts of mothers.Four million bodies in chains--four million souls in fetters.All the
sacred relations of wife, mother, father and child trampled beneath the
brutal feet of might.All this was done under our own beautiful banner
of the free.We hear the roar and shriek of the bursting
shell.Instead of
slaves we see men and women and children.The wand of progress touches
the auction-block, the slave-pen, and the whipping-post, and we see
homes and firesides, and school-houses and books, and where all was want
and crime, and cruelty and fear, we see the faces of the free.They died for liberty--they died for us.They
are at rest, They sleep in the land they made free, under the flag
they rendered stainless, under the solemn pines, the sad hemlocks, the
tearful willows, the embracing vines.They sleep beneath the shadows of
the clouds, careless alike of sunshine or storm, each in the window-less
palace of rest.Earth may run red with other wars--they are at peace.In
the midst of battle, in the roar of conflict, they found the serenity of
death.I have one sentiment for the soldiers living and dead--cheers for
the living and tears for the dead.It is not necessary to be a pig in order to raise one.A blow from a parent leaves a scar on the soul of the child.A mortgage casts a shadow on the sunniest field.Agriculture is the basis of all wealth.It is better to be a whole farmer than part of a mechanic.One good school-master is worth a thousand priests.Out in the intellectual sea there is room for every sail.An honest God is the noblest work of man.A King is a non-producing thief, sitting on a throne, surrounded by
vermin.Whiskey is the son of villainies, the father of all crimes, the mother
of all abominations, the devil's best friend, and God's worst enemy.An Orthodox Man is a gentleman petrified in his mind.Chicago is a marvel of energy, a miracle of nerva

The Pulpit is a pillory.Civilization is the Child of Forethought

Prejudice is the Child of Ignorance.I believe in the democracy of the fireside, in the republicanism of the
home.I believe in truth, in
investigation, in forethought.I believe in the gospel of education, of cheerfulness, of justice and
intelligence.We can march about all over, and fire off the cannons and
everything!"Yes, but how's General McClellan to hear anything about it?""Why--I don't know," said Peter, rather taken aback by this view of the
subject."Well, somehow--never mind, it will be grand fun, and I mean
to ask my father right away."Finally it was
concluded that it might make more impression on Mr.Schermerhorn's mind,
if the application came from the regiment in a body; so, running for
their swords and guns, officers and men found their places in the
battalion, and the grand procession started on its way--chattering all
the time, in utter defiance of that "article of war" which forbids
"talking in the ranks."Just as they were passing the lake, they heard
carriage wheels crunching on the gravel, and drew up in a long line on
the other side of the road to let the vehicle pass them; much to the
astonishment of two pretty young ladies and a sweet little girl, about
Freddy's age, who were leaning comfortably back in the handsome
barouche.exclaimed one of the ladies, "what in the world is all
this?"cried Peter, running up to the carriage, "why, these are the
Dashahed Zouaves, Miss Carlton.Good morning, Miss Jessie," to the little girl on the front seat, who
was looking on with deep interest."Oh, to be sure, I remember," said Miss Carlton, laughing; "come,
introduce the Zouaves, Peter; we are wild to know them!"The boys clustered eagerly about the carriage and a lively chat took
place.The Zouaves, some blushing and bashful, others frank and
confident, and all desperately in love already with pretty little
Jessie, related in high glee their adventures--except the celebrated
court martial--and enlarged glowingly upon the all-important subject of
the grand review.Colonel Freddy, of course, played a prominent part in all this, and with
his handsome face, bright eyes, and frank, gentlemanly ways, needed only
those poor lost curls to be a perfect picture of a soldier.He chattered
away with Miss Lucy, the second sister, and obtained her special promise
that she would plead their cause with Mr.Schermerhorn in case the
united petitions of the corps should fail.The young ladies did not know
of Mrs.Schermerhorn's departure, but Freddy and Peter together coaxed
them to come up to the house "anyhow."The carriage was accordingly
taken into the procession, and followed it meekly to the house; the
Zouaves insisting on being escort, much to the terror of the young
ladies; who were in constant apprehension that the rear rank and the
horses might come to kicks--not to say blows--and the embarrassment of
the coachman; who, as they were constantly stopping unexpectedly to turn
round and talk, didn't know "where to have them," as the saying is.However, they reached their destination in safety before long, and
found Mr.Schermerhorn seated on the piazza.He hastened forward to meet
them, with the cordial greeting of an old friend."Well, old bachelor," said Miss Carlton, gayly, as the young ladies
ascended the steps, "you see we have come to visit you in state, with
the military escort befitting patriotic young ladies who have four
brothers on the Potomac."Gone to Niagara and left me a 'lone lorn creetur;'" said Mr."Basely deserted me when my farming couldn't be
left.But how am I to account for the presence of the military,
mademoiselle?""Really, I beg their pardons," exclaimed Miss Carlton."They have come
on a special deputation to you, Mr.Schermerhorn, so pray don't let us
interrupt business."Thus apostrophised, the boys scampered eagerly up the steps; and Freddy,
a little bashful, but looking as bright as a button, delivered the
following brief oration: "Mr.Schermerhorn: I want--that is, the boys
want--I mean we all want--to have a grand review on Saturday, and ask
our friends to look on.Schermerhorn,
smiling; "but what will become of you good people when I tell you that
I have just received a letter from Mrs.Schermerhorn, asking me to join
her this week instead of next, and bring Peter with me."interrupted Peter; "can't you tell ma
I've joined the army for the war?"No, the army
must give you up, and lose a valuable member, Master Peter; but just
have the goodness to listen a moment.The review shall take place, but
as the camp will have to break up on Saturday instead of Monday, as I
had intended, the performances must come off to-morrow.The boys gave a delighted consent to this arrangement, and now the only
thing which dampened their enjoyment was the prospect of such a speedy
end being put to their camp life.what was the fun for a
fellow to be poked into a stupid watering place, where he must bother to
keep his hair parted down the middle, and a clean collar stiff enough to
choke him on from morning till night?"as Tom indignantly remarked to
George and Will the same evening."The fact is, this sort of thing is
_the_ thing for a _man_ after all!"an opinion in which the other _men_
fully concurred.But let us return to the piazza, where we have left the party.After a
few moments more spent in chatting with Mr.Schermerhorn, it was decided
to accept Colonel Freddy's polite invitation, which he gave with such a
bright little bow, to inspect the camp.You may be sure it was in
apple-pie order, for Jerry, who had taken the Zouaves under his special
charge, insisted on their keeping it in such a state of neatness as only
a soldier ever achieved.The party made an extremely picturesque
group--the gay uniforms of the Zouaves, and light summer dresses of the
ladies, charmingly relieved against the background of trees; while Mr.Schermerhorn's stately six feet, and somewhat portly proportions, quite
reminded one of General Scott; especially among such a small army; in
which George alone quite came up to the regulation "63 inches."Little Jessie ran hither and thither, surrounded by a crowd of adorers,
who would have given their brightest buttons, every "man" of them, to be
the most entertaining fellow of the corps.They showed her the battery
and the stacks of shining guns--made to stand up by Jerry in a wonderful
fashion that the boys never could hope to attain--the inside of all the
tents, and the smoke guard house (Tom couldn't help a blush as he looked
in); and finally, as a parting compliment (which, let me tell you, is
the greatest, in a boy's estimation, that can possibly be paid), Freddy
made her a present of his very largest and most gorgeous "glass agates;"
one of which was all the colors of the rainbow, and the other
patriotically adorned with the Stars and Stripes in enamel.Peter
climbed to the top of the tallest cherry tree, and brought her down a
bough at least a yard and a half long, crammed with "ox hearts;" Harry
eagerly offered to make any number of "stunning baskets" out of the
stones, and in short there never was such a belle seen before."Oh, a'int she jolly!"was the ruling opinion among the Zouaves.A
private remark was also circulated to the effect that "Miss Jessie was
stunningly pretty."The young ladies at last said good-by to the camp; promising faithfully
to send all the visitors they could to the grand review, and drove off
highly entertained with their visit.Schermerhorn decided to take
the afternoon boat for the city and return early Friday morning, and the
boys, left to themselves, began to think of dinner, as it was two
o'clock.A brisk discussion was kept up all dinner time you may be sure,
concerning the event to come off on the morrow."I should like to know, for my part, what we do in a review," said
Jimmy, balancing his fork artistically on the end of his finger, and
looking solemnly round the table."March about,
and form into ranks and columns, and all that first, then do charming
"parade rest," "'der humps!"and the rest of it; and finish off by
firing off our guns, and showing how we can't hit anything by any
possibility!""But I'm sure father won't let us have any powder," said Peter
disconsolately."You can't think how I burnt the end of my nose last
Fourth with powder!It was so sore I couldn't blow it for a week!"The boys all burst out laughing at this dreadful disaster, and George
said, "You weren't lighting it with the end of your nose, were you?""No; but I was stooping over, charging one of my cannon, and I dropped
the 'punk' right in the muzzle somehow, and, would you believe it, the
nasty thing went off and burnt my nose!and father said I shouldn't play
with powder any more, because I might have put out my eyes.""Well, we must take it out in marching, then," said Freddy, with a
tremendous sigh."No, hold on; I'll tell you what we can do!""I have
some 'double headers' left from the Fourth; we might fire them out of
the cannon; they make noise enough, I'm sure.I'll write to my mother
this afternoon and get them."The boys couldn't help being struck with the generosity of this offer,
coming from Tom after their late rather unkind treatment of him; and the
older ones especially were very particular to thank him for his present.As soon as dinner was over, he started for the house to ask Mr.As he hurried along the road, his
bright black eyes sparkling with the happiness of doing a good action,
he heard trotting steps behind him, felt an arm stealing round his neck,
schoolboy fashion, and there was Freddy."I ran after you all the way," he pantingly said."I want to tell you,
dear Tom, how much we are obliged to you for giving us your crackers,
and how sorry we are that we acted so rudely to you the other day.Please forgive us; we all like you so much, and we would feel as mean as
anything to take your present without begging pardon.George, Peter, and
I feel truly ashamed of ourselves every time we think of that abominable
court martial.""There, old fellow, don't say a word more about it!"was the hearty
response; and Tom threw his arm affectionately about his companion."It
was my fault, Freddy, and all because I was mad at poor old Jerry; how
silly!I was sorry for what I said right afterward.""Yes; I'll like you as long as I live!And so
we will leave the two on their walk to the house, and close this
abominably long chapter.THERE are really scarcely words enough in the dictionary properly to
describe the immense amount of drill got through with by the Dashahed
Zouaves between three o'clock that afternoon and twelve, noon, of the
following day.This Friday afternoon was going to be memorable in
history for one of the most splendid reviews on record.They almost ran
poor old Jerry off his legs in their eagerness to go over every possible
variety of exercise known to "Hardee's Tactics," and nearly dislocated
their shoulder blades trying to waggle their elbows backward and forward
all at once when they went at "double quick;" at the same time keeping
the other arm immovably pinioned to their sides.Then that wonderful
operation of stacking the rebellious guns, which obstinately clattered
down nine times and a half out of ten, had to be gone through with, and
a special understanding promulgated in the corps as to when Jerry's
"'der arms!"meant "shoulder arms," and when "order arms" (or bringing
all the muskets down together with a bang); and, in short, there never
was such a busy time seen in camp before.Friday morning dawned, if possible, still more splendidly than any of
the preceding days, with a cool, refreshing breeze, just enough snowy
clouds in the sky to keep off the fiery summer heat in a measure, and
not a headache nor a heartache among the Zouaves to mar the pleasure of
the day.The review was to come off at four o'clock, when the July sun
would be somewhat diminished in warmth, and from some hints that Jerry
let fall, Mrs.Lockitt, and the fat cook, Mrs.Mincemeat, were holding
high council up at the house, over a certain collation to be partaken of
at the end of the entertainments.As the day wore on the excitement of our friends the Zouaves increased.They could hardly either eat their dinners, or sit down for more than a
moment at a time; and when, about three o'clock, Mr.Schermerhorn
entered the busy little camp, he was surrounded directly with a crowd of
eager questioners, all talking at once, and making as much noise as a
colony of rooks."Patience, patience, my good friends!"Schermerhorn, holding
up a finger for silence.Tom, here are your 'double
headers,' with love from your mother.Fred, I saw your father to-day,
and they are all coming down to the review.George, here is a note left
for you in my box at the Post Office, and Dashahed Zouaves in
general--I have one piece of advice to give you.Get dressed quietly,
and then sit down and rest yourselves.You will be tired out by the end
of the afternoon, at all events; so don't frisk about more than you can
help at present;" and Mr.Schermerhorn left the camp; while the boys,
under strong pressure of Jerry, and the distant notes of a band which
suddenly began to make itself heard, dressed themselves as nicely as
they could, and sat down with heroic determination to wait for four
o'clock.Presently, carriages began to crunch over the gravel road one after
another, filled with merry children, and not a few grown people besides.Jourdain, with Bella, were among the first to arrive; and
soon after the Carltons' barouche drove up.Jessie, for some unknown
reason, was full of half nervous glee, and broke into innumerable little
trilling laughs when any one spoke to her.A sheet of lilac note paper,
folded up tight, which she held in her hand, seemed to have something to
do with it, and her soft brown curls and spreading muslin skirts were in
equal danger of irremediable "mussing," as she fidgetted about on the
carriage seat, fully as restless as any of the Zouaves.Schermerhorn received his guests on the piazza, where all the chairs
in the house, one would think, were placed for the company, as the best
view of the lawn was from this point.To the extreme right were the
white tents of the camp, half hidden by the immense trunk of a
magnificent elm, the only tree that broke the smooth expanse of the
lawn.On the left a thick hawthorne hedge separated the ornamental
grounds from the cultivated fields of the place, while in front the view
was bounded by the blue and sparkling waters of the Sound.Soon four o'clock struck; and, punctual to the moment, the Zouaves could
be seen in the distance, forming their ranks.Jerry, in his newest suit
of regimentals, bustled about here and there, and presently his voice
was heard shouting, "Are ye all ready now?and to
the melodious notes of "Dixie," performed by the band, which was
stationed nearer the house, the regiment started up the lawn!Jerry
marching up beside them, and occasionally uttering such mysterious
mandates as, "Easy in the centre!Oh, what a burst of delighted applause greeted them as they neared the
house!The boys hurrahed, the girls clapped their hands, ladies and
gentlemen waved their hats and handkerchiefs; while the Dashahed
Zouaves, too soldierly _now_ to grin, drew up in a long line, and stood
like statues, without so much as winking.And now the music died away, and everybody was as still as a mouse,
while Jerry advanced to the front, and issued the preliminary order:

"To the rear--open order!"and the rear rank straightway fell back;
executing, in fact, that wonderful "tekkinapesstoth'rare" which had
puzzled them so much on the first day of their drilling.Then came those
other wonderful orders:

          "P'_sent_ humps!And so on, at which the muskets flew backward and forward, up and down,
with such wonderful precision.The spectators were delighted beyond
measure; an enthusiastic young gentleman, with about three hairs on
each side of his mustache, who belonged to the Twenty-second Regiment,
declared "It was the best drill he had seen out of his company room!"a
celebrated artist, whose name I dare not tell for the world, sharpened
his pencil, and broke the point off three times in his hurry, and at
last produced the beautiful sketch which appears at the front of this
volume; while all the little boys who were looking on, felt as if they
would give every one of their new boots and glass agates to belong to
the gallant Dashahed Zouaves.[Illustration: "DOUBLE-QUICK."]After the guns had been put in every possible variety of position, the
regiment went through their marching.They broke into companies,
formed the line again, divided in two equal parts, called "breaking into
platoons," showed how to "wheel on the right flank," and all manner of
other mysteries.Finally, they returned to their companies, and on Jerry's giving the
order, they started at "double quick" (which is the most comical
tritty-trot movement you can think of), dashed down the <DW72> of the
lawn, round the great elm, up hill again full speed, and in a moment
more were drawn up in unbroken lines before the house, and standing once
again like so many statues.Round after round of applause greeted the
Zouaves, who kept their positions for a moment, then snatching off
their saucy little fez caps, they gave the company three cheers in
return, of the most tremendous description; which quite took away the
little remaining breath they had after the "double quick."Thus ended the first part of the review; and now, with the assistance of
their rather Lilliputian battery, and Tom's double headers, they went
through some firing quite loud enough to make the little girls start and
jump uncomfortably; so this part of the entertainment was brought to
rather a sudden conclusion.Jerry had just issued the order, "Close up
in ranks to dismiss," when Mr.Schermerhorn, who, with Miss Carlton and
Jessie, had left the piazza a few minutes before, came forward, saying,
"Have the goodness to wait a moment, Colonel; there is one more ceremony
to go through with."The boys looked at each other in silent curiosity, wondering what could
be coming; when, all at once, the chairs on the piazza huddled back in a
great hurry, to make a lane for a beautiful little figure, which came
tripping from the open door.It was Jessie; but a great change had been made in her appearance.Over
her snowy muslin skirts she had a short classic tunic of red, white, and
blue silk; a wreath of red and white roses and bright blue jonquils
encircled her curls, and in her hand she carried a superb banner.It
was made of dark blue silk, trimmed with gold fringe; on one side was
painted an American eagle, and on the other the words "Dashahed
Zouaves," surrounded with a blaze of glory and gold stars.She advanced
to the edge of the piazza, and in a clear, sweet voice, a little
tremulous, but very distinct, she said:

          "COLONEL AND BRAVE SOLDIERS:

          "I congratulate you, in the name of our friends,
          on the success you have achieved.You have shown
          us to-day what Young America can do; and as a
          testimonial of our high admiration, I present you
          the colors of your regiment!"Take them, as the assurance that our hearts are
          with you; bear them as the symbol of the Cause you
          have enlisted under; and should you fall beneath
          them on the field of battle, I bid you lay down
          your lives cheerfully for the flag of your
          country, and breathe with your last sigh the name
          of the Union!Freddy's cheeks grew crimson, and the great tears swelled to his eyes as
he advanced to take the flag which Jessie held toward him.And now our
little Colonel came out bright, sure enough.Perhaps not another member
of the regiment, called upon to make a speech in this way, could have
thought of a word to reply; but Freddy's quick wit supplied him with
the right ideas; and it was with a proud, happy face, and clear voice
that he responded:

          "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:

          "I thank you, in the name of my regiment, for the
          honor you have done us.Inspired by your praises,
          proud to belong to the army of the Republic, we
          hope to go on as we have begun.To your kindness
          we owe the distinguishing colors under which we
          march hereafter; and by the Union for which we
          fight, they shall never float over a retreating
          battalion!"the cheers and clapping of hands which followed this little speech!Everybody was looking at Freddy as he stood there, the colors in his
hand, and the bright flush on his cheek, with the greatest admiration.Of course, his parents weren't proud of him; certainly not!But the wonders were not at an end yet; for suddenly the band began
playing a new air, and to this accompaniment, the sweet voice of some
lady unseen, but which sounded to those who knew, wonderfully like Miss
Lucy Carlton's, sang the following patriotic ballad:

          "We will stand by our Flag--let it lead where it will--
          Our hearts and our hopes fondly cling to it still;
          Through battle and danger our Cause must be won--
          Yet forward!still unsullied and bright,
          As when first its fair stars lit oppression's dark night
          And the standard that guides us forever shall be
          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"A handful of living--an army of dead,
          The last charge been made and the last prayer been said;
          What is it--as sad we retreat from the plain
          That cheers us, and nerves us to rally again?to our country God-given,
          That gleams through our ranks like a glory from heaven!And the foe, as they fly, in our vanguard shall see
          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"We will fight for the Flag, by the love that we bear
          In the Union and Freedom, we'll baffle despair;
          Trust on in our country, strike home for the right,
          And Treason shall vanish like mists of the night.every star in it glows,
          The terror of traitors!And the victory that crowns us shall glorified be,
          'Neath the Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"As the song ended, there was another tumult of applause; and then the
band struck up a lively quickstep, and the company, with the Zouaves
marching ahead, poured out on the lawn toward the camp, where a
bountiful collation was awaiting them, spread on the regimental table.Two splendid pyramids of flowers ornamented the centre, and all manner
of "goodies," as the children call them, occupied every inch of space on
the sides.At the head of the table Jerry had contrived a canopy from a
large flag, and underneath this, Miss Jessie, Colonel Freddy, with the
other officers, and some favored young ladies of their own age, took
their seats.The other children found places around the table, and a
merrier fete champetre never was seen.The band continued to play lively
airs from time to time, and I really can give you my word as an author,
that nobody looked cross for a single minute!Between you and me, little reader, there had been a secret arrangement
among the grown folks interested in the regiment, to get all this up in
such fine style.Every one had contributed something to give the Zouaves
their flag and music, while to Mr.Schermerhorn it fell to supply the
supper; and arrangements had been made and invitations issued since the
beginning of the week.The regiment, certainly, had the credit, however,
of getting up the review, it only having been the idea of their good
friends to have the entertainment and flag presentation.So there was a
pleasant surprise on both sides; and each party in the transaction, was
quite as much astonished and delighted as the other could wish.The long sunset shadows were rapidly stealing over the velvet sward as
the company rose from table, adding a new charm to the beauty of the
scene.Everywhere the grass was dotted with groups of elegant ladies and
gentlemen, and merry children, in light summer dresses and quaintly
pretty uniforms.The little camp, with the stacks of guns down its
centre, the bayonets flashing in the last rays of the sun, was all
crowded and brilliant with happy people; looking into the tents and
admiring their exquisite order, inspecting the bright muskets, and
listening eagerly or good-humoredly, as they happened to be children or
grown people, to the explanations and comments of the Zouaves.And on the little grassy knoll, where the flag staff was planted,
central figure of the scene, stood Colonel Freddy, silent and thoughtful
for the first time to-day, with Jerry beside him.The old man had
scarcely left his side since the boy took the flag; he would permit no
one else to wait upon him at table, and his eyes followed him as he
moved among the gay crowd, with a glance of the utmost pride and
affection.The old volunteer seemed to feel that the heart of a soldier
beat beneath the little dandy ruffled shirt and gold-laced jacket of the
young Colonel.Suddenly, the boy snatches up again the regimental
colors; the Stars and Stripes, and little Jessie's flag, and shakes
them out to the evening breeze; and as they flash into view and once
more the cheers of the Zouaves greet their colors, he says, with
quivering lip and flashing eye, "Jerry, if God spares me to be a man,
I'll live and die a soldier!"The soft evening light was deepening into night, and the beautiful
planet Venus rising in the west, when the visitors bade adieu to the
camp; the Zouaves were shaken hands with until their wrists fairly
ached; and then they all shook hands with "dear" Jessie, as Charley was
heard to call her before the end of the day, and heard her say in her
soft little voice how sorry she was they must go to-morrow (though she
certainly couldn't have been sorrier than _they_ were), and then the
good people all got into their carriages again, and drove off; waving
their handkerchiefs for good-by as long as the camp could be seen; and
so, with the sound of the last wheels dying away in the distance, ended
the very end of

                                THE GRAND REVIEW.AND now, at last, had come that "day of disaster," when Camp McClellan
must be deserted.The very sun didn't shine so brilliantly as usual,
thought the Zouaves; and it was positively certain that the past five
days, although they had occurred in the middle of summer, were the very
shortest ever known!Eleven o'clock was the hour appointed for the
breaking up of the camp, in order that they might return to the city by
the early afternoon boat."Is it possible we have been here a week?"exclaimed Jimmy, as he sat
down to breakfast."It seems as if we had only come yesterday.""What a jolly time it has been!""I don't want
to go to Newport a bit."To Baltimore--but I don't mean to Secesh!"added Tom, with a little
blush."I have a cousin in the Palmetto Guards at Charleston, and that's
one too many rebels in the family."cried George Chadwick; "the Pringles are a first rate
family; the rest of you are loyal enough, I'm sure!"and George gave
Tom such a slap on the back, in token of his good will, that it quite
brought the tears into his eyes.When breakfast was over, the Zouaves repaired to their tents, and
proceeded to pack their clothes away out of the lockers.They were not
very scientific packers, and, in fact, the usual mode of doing the
business was to ram everything higgledy-piggledy into their valises, and
then jump on them until they consented to come together and be locked.Presently Jerry came trotting down with a donkey cart used on the farm,
and under his directions the boys folded their blankets neatly up, and
placed them in the vehicle, which then drove off with its load, leaving
them to get out and pile together the other furnishings of the tents;
for, of course, as soldiers, they were expected to wind up their own
affairs, and we all know that boys will do considerable _hard work_ when
it comes in the form of _play_.Just as the cart, with its vicious
little wrong-headed steed, had tugged, and jerked, and worried itself
out of sight, a light basket carriage, drawn by two dashing black
Canadian ponies, drew up opposite the camp, and the reins were let fall
by a young lady in a saucy "pork pie" straw hat, who was driving--no
other than Miss Carlton, with Jessie beside her.The boys eagerly
surrounded the little carriage, and Miss Carlton said, laughing, "Jessie
begged so hard for a last look at the camp, that I had to bring her."Really," repeated Freddy; "but I am so glad you came, Miss Jessie, just
in time to see us off.""You know soldiers take themselves away houses and all," said George;
"you will see the tents come down with a run presently."As he spoke, the donkey
cart rattled up, and Jerry, touching his cap to the ladies, got out, and
prepared to superintend the downfall of the tents.By his directions,
two of the Zouaves went to each tent, and pulled the stakes first from
one corner, then the other; then they grasped firmly the pole which
supported the centre, and when the sergeant ejaculated "Now!"the tents slid smoothly to the ground all at the same moment,
just as you may have made a row of blocks fall down by upsetting the
first one.And now came the last ceremony, the hauling down of the flag.shouted Jerry, and instantly a company was
detached, who brought the six little cannon under the flagstaff, and
charged them with the last of the double headers, saved for this
purpose; Freddy stood close to the flagstaff, with the halyards ready in
his hands.and the folds of the flag stream out proudly in the breeze, as it
rapidly descends the halyards, and flutters softly to the greensward.There was perfectly dead silence for a moment; then the voice of Mr.Schermerhorn was heard calling, "Come, boys, are you ready?Jump in,
then, it is time to start for the boat."The boys turned and saw the
carriages which had brought them so merrily to the camp waiting to
convey them once more to the wharf; while a man belonging to the farm
was rapidly piling the regimental luggage into a wagon.With sorrowful faces the Zouaves clustered around the pretty pony
chaise; shaking hands once more with Jessie, and internally vowing to
adore her as long as they lived.Then they got into the carriages, and
old Jerry grasped Freddy's hand with an affectionate "Good-by, my little
Colonel, God bless ye!Old Jerry won't never forget your noble face as
long as he lives."It would have seemed like insulting the old man to
offer him money in return for his loving admiration, but the handsome
gilt-edged Bible that found its way to him soon after the departure of
the regiment, was inscribed with the irregular schoolboy signature of
"Freddy Jourdain, with love to his old friend Jeremiah Pike."As for the regimental standards, they were found to be rather beyond
the capacity of a rockaway crammed full of Zouaves, so Tom insisted on
riding on top of the baggage, that he might have the pleasure of
carrying them all the way.Up he mounted, as brisk as a lamplighter,
with that monkey, Peter, after him, the flags were handed up, and with
three ringing cheers, the vehicles started at a rapid trot, and the
regiment was fairly off.They almost broke their necks leaning back to
see the last of "dear Jessie," until the locusts hid them from sight,
when they relapsed into somewhat dismal silence for full five minutes.As Peter was going on to Niagara with his father, Mr.Schermerhorn
accompanied the regiment to the city, which looked dustier and red
brickier (what a word!)than ever, now that they were fresh from the
lovely green of the country.Schermerhorn's advice, the party
took possession of two empty Fifth avenue stages which happened to be
waiting at the Fulton ferry, and rode slowly up Broadway to Chambers
street, where Peter and his father bid them good-by, and went off to the
depot.As Peter had declined changing his clothes before he left, they
had to travel all the way to Buffalo with our young friend in this
unusual guise; but, as people had become used to seeing soldiers
parading about in uniform, they didn't seem particularly surprised,
whereat Master Peter was rather disappointed.To go back to the Zouaves, however.When the stages turned into Fifth
avenue, they decided to get out; and after forming their ranks in fine
style, they marched up the avenue, on the sidewalk this time, stopping
at the various houses or street corners where they must bid adieu to one
and another of their number, promising to see each other again as soon
as possible.At last only Tom and Freddy were left to go home by themselves.As they
marched along, keeping faultless step, Freddy exclaimed, "I tell you
what, Tom!I mean to ask my father, the minute he comes home, to let me
go to West Point as soon as I leave school!I must be a soldier--I
can't think of anything else!""That's just what I mean to do!"cried Tom, with sparkling eyes; "and,
Fred, if you get promoted before me, promise you will have me in your
regiment, won't you?"answered Freddy; "but you're the oldest, Tom,
and, you know, the oldest gets promoted first; so mind you don't forget
me when you come to your command!"As he spoke, they reached his own home; and our hero, glad after all to
come back to father, mother, and sister, bounded up the steps, and rang
the bell good and _hard_, just to let Joseph know that a personage of
eminence had arrived.As the door opened, he turned gayly round, cap in
hand, saying, "Good-by, Maryland; you've left the regiment, but you'll
never leave the Union!"and the last words he heard Tom say were, "No,
by George, _never_!"*       *       *       *       *

And now, dear little readers, my boy friends in particular, the history
of Freddy Jourdain must close.He still lives in New York, and attends
Dr.Larned's school, where he is at the head of all his classes.The Dashahed Zouaves have met very often since the encampment, and had
many a good drill in their room--the large attic floor which Mr.Jourdain allowed them for their special accommodation, and where the
beautiful regimental colors are carefully kept, to be proudly displayed
in every parade of the Zouaves.When he is sixteen, the boy Colonel is to enter West Point Academy, and
learn to be a real soldier; while Tom--poor Tom, who went down to
Baltimore that pleasant July month, promising so faithfully to join
Freddy in the cadet corps, may never see the North again.And in conclusion let me say, that should our country again be in danger
in after years, which God forbid, we may be sure that first in the
field, and foremost in the van of the grand army, will be our gallant
young friend,

                                 COLONEL FREDDY.IT took a great many Saturday afternoons to finish the story of "Colonel
Freddy," and the children returned to it at each reading with renewed
and breathless interest.George and Helen couldn't help jumping up off
their seats once or twice and clapping their hands with delight when
anything specially exciting took place in the pages of the wonderful
story that was seen "before it was printed," and a great many "oh's" and
"ah's" testified to their appreciation of the gallant "Dashahed
Zouaves."They laughed over the captive Tom, and cried over the true
story of the old sergeant; and when at length the very last word had
been read, and their mother had laid down the manuscript, George sprang
up once more, exclaiming; "Oh, I wish I could be a boy soldier!Mamma,
mayn't I recruit a regiment and camp out too?"cried his sister; "I wish I had been Jessie; what a
pity it wasn't all true!""And what if I should tell you," said their mother, laughing, "that a
little bird has whispered in my ear that 'Colonel Freddy' was
wonderfully like your little Long Island friend Hilton R----?""Oh, something funny I heard about him last summer; never mind what!"The children wisely concluded that it was no use to ask any more
questions; at the same moment solemnly resolving that the very next time
they paid a visit to their aunt, who lived at Astoria, they would beg
her to let them drive over to Mr.R----'s place, and find out all about
it.After this, there were no more readings for several Saturdays; but at
last one morning when the children had almost given up all hopes of more
stories, George opened his eyes on the sock hanging against the door,
which looked more bulgy than ever.he shouted; "Aunt Fanny's
daughter hasn't forgotten us, after all!"and dressing himself in a
double quick, helter-skelter fashion, George dashed out into the entry,
forgot his good resolution, and slid down the banisters like a streak of
lightning and began pummelling on his sister's door with both fists;
shouting, "Come, get up!here's another Sock story for
us!"This delightful announcement was quite sufficient to make Helen's
stockings, which she was just drawing on in a lazy fashion, fly up to
their places in a hurry; then she popped her button-over boots on the
wrong feet, and had to take them off and try again; and, in short, the
whole of her dressing was an excellent illustration of that time-honored
maxim, "The more _haste_, the worse _speed_;" George, meanwhile,
performing a distracted Indian war dance in the entry outside, until his
father opened his door and wanted to know what the racket was all about.At this moment Helen came out, and the two children scampered down
stairs, and sitting down side by side on the sofa, they proceeded to
examine this second instalment of the Sock stories.They found it was
again a whole book; and the title, on a little page by itself, read
"GERMAN SOCKS.""These must be more stories like that
dear 'Little White Angel.'"And so they proved to be; for, on their mother's commencing to read the
first story, it was found to be called, "God's Pensioners;" and
commenced, "It was a cold--" but stop!This book was to be devoted
to "Colonel Freddy;" but if you will only go to Mr.Leavitt's, the
publishers, you will there discover what was the rest of the second Sock
Stories.*       *       *       *       *

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Red, White, Blue Socks.LXXXVIII./--_Of the Motions of a Man._


/When/ you mean to represent a man removing a weight, consider that the
motions are various, viz.either a simple motion, by bending himself
to raise the weight from the ground upwards, or when he drags the
weight after him, or pushes it before him, or pulls it down with a rope
passing through a pulley.It is to be observed, that the weight of the
man's body pulls the more in proportion as the centre of his gravity
is removed from the centre of his support.To this must be added the
strength of the effort that the legs and back make when they are bent,
to return to their natural straight situation.A man never ascends or descends, nor walks at all in any direction,
without raising the heel of the back foot.LXXXIX./--_Of the Disposition of Members preparing to act with
great Force_, Plate XIV./When/ a man prepares himself to strike a violent blow, he bends and
twists his body as far as he can to the side contrary to that which
he means to strike, and collecting all his strength, he, by a complex
motion, returns and falls upon the point he has in view[21].XC./--_Of throwing any Thing with Violence_, Plate XV./A man/ throwing a dart, a stone, or any thing else with violence,
may be represented, chiefly, two different ways; that is, he may be
preparing to do it, or the act may be already performed.If you mean to
place him in the act of preparation, the inside of the foot upon which
he rests will be under the perpendicular line of the pit of the neck;
and if it be the right foot, the left shoulder will be perpendicular
over the toes of the same foot.XCI./--_On the Motion of driving any Thing into or drawing it
out of the Ground._


/He/ who wishes to pitch a pole into the ground, or draw one out of it,
will raise the leg and bend the knee opposite to the arm which acts,
in order to balance himself upon the foot that rests, without which he
could neither drive in, nor pull out any thing.XCII./--_Of forcible Motions_, Plate XVI./Of/ the two arms, that will be most powerful in its effort, which,
having been farthest removed from its natural situation, is assisted
more strongly by the other parts to bring it to the place where it
means to go.As the man A, who moves the arm with a club E, and brings
it to the opposite side B, assisted by the motion of the whole body._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]

/Chap.XCIII./--_The Action of Jumping._


/Nature/ will of itself, and without any reasoning in the mind of a man
going to jump, prompt him to raise his arms and shoulders by a sudden
motion, together with a great part of his body, and to lift them up
high, till the power of the effort subsides.This impetuous motion
is accompanied by an instantaneous extension of the body which had
bent itself, like a spring or bow, along the back, the joints of the
thighs, knees, and feet, and is let off obliquely, that is, upwards
and forwards; so that the disposition of the body tending forwards
and upwards, makes it describe a great arch when it springs up, which
increases the leap.XCIV./--_Of the three Motions in jumping upwards._


/When/ a man jumps upwards, the motion of the head is three times
quicker than that of the heel, before the extremity of the foot quits
the ground, and twice as quick as that of the hips; because three
angles are opened and extended at the same time: the superior one is
that formed by the body at its joint with the thigh before, the second
is at the joint of the thighs and legs behind, and the third is at the
instep before[22].XCV./--_Of the easy Motions of Members._


/In/ regard to the freedom and ease of motions, it is very necessary
to observe, that when you mean to represent a figure which has to turn
itself a little round, the feet and all the other members are not to
move in the same direction as the head.But you will divide that motion
among four joints, viz.the feet, the knees, the hips, and the neck.If it rests upon the right leg, the left knee should be a little bent
inward, with its foot somewhat raised outward.The left shoulder should
be lower than the other, and the nape of the neck turned on the same
side as the outward ankle of the left foot, and the left shoulder
perpendicular over the great toe of the right foot.And take it as a
general maxim, that figures do not turn their heads straight with the
chest, Nature having for our convenience formed the neck so as to turn
with ease on every side, when the eyes want to look round; and to this
the other joints are in some measure subservient.If the figure be
sitting, and the arms have some employment across the body, the breast
will turn over the joint of the hip._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.XCVI./--_The greatest Twist which a Man can make, in turning to
look at himself behind._ Plate XVII./The/ greatest twist that the body can perform is when the back of
the heels and the front of the face are seen at the same time.It is
not done without difficulty, and is effected by bending the leg and
lowering the shoulder on that side towards which the head turns.The
cause of this motion, and also which of the muscles move first and
which last, I shall explain in my treatise on anatomy[23].XCVII./--_Of turning the Leg without the Thigh._


/It/ is impossible to turn the leg inwards or outwards without turning
the thigh by the same motion, because the setting in of the bones at
the knee is such, that they have no motion but backwards and forwards,
and no more than is necessary for walking or kneeling; never sideways,
because the form of the bones at the joint of the knee does not allow
it.If this joint had been made pliable on all sides, as that of the
shoulder, or that of the thigh bone with the hip, a man would have
had his legs bent on each side as often as backwards and forwards,
and seldom or never straight with the thigh.Besides, this joint can
bend only one way, so that in walking it can never go beyond the
straight line of the leg; it bends only forwards, for if it could bend
backwards, a man could never get up again upon his feet, if once he
were kneeling; as when he means to get up from the kneeling posture (on
both knees), he gives the whole weight of his body to one of the knees
to support, unloading the other, which at that time feels no other
weight than its own, and therefore is lifted up with ease, and rests
his foot flat upon the ground; then returning the whole weight upon
that foot, and leaning his hand upon his knee, he at once extends the
other arm, raises his head, and straightening the thigh with the body,
he springs up, and rests upon the same foot, while he brings up the
other.XCVIII./--_Postures of Figures._


/Figures/ that are set in a fixed attitude, are nevertheless to have
some contrast of parts.If one arm come before, the other remains
still or goes behind.If the figure rest upon one leg, the shoulder on
that side will be lower than the other.This is observed by artists
of judgment, who always take care to balance the figure well upon its
feet, for fear it should appear to fall.Because by resting upon one
foot, the other leg, being a little bent, does not support the body any
more than if it were dead; therefore it is necessary that the parts
above that leg should transfer the centre of their weight upon the leg
which supports the body.XCIX./--_Of the Gracefulness of the Members._


/The/ members are to be suited to the body in graceful motions,
expressive of the meaning which the figure is intended to convey.If it had to give the idea of genteel and agreeable carriage, the
members must be slender and well turned, but not lean; the muscles very
slightly marked, indicating in a soft manner such as must necessarily
appear; the arms, particularly, pliant, and no member in a straight
line with any other adjoining member.If it happen, on account of the
motion of the figure, that the right hip be higher than the left, make
the joint of the shoulder fall perpendicularly on the highest part of
that hip; and let that right shoulder be lower than the left.The pit
of the neck will always be perpendicular over the middle of the instep
of the foot that supports the body.The leg that does not bear will
have its knee a little lower than the other, and near the other leg.In regard to the positions of the head and arms, they are infinite, and
for that reason I shall not enter into any detailed rule concerning
them; suffice it to say, that they are to be easy and free, graceful,
and varied in their bendings, so that they may not appear stiff like
pieces of wood.C./--_That it is impossible for any Memory to retain the Aspects
and Changes of the Members._


/It/ is impossible that any memory can be able to retain all the
aspects or motions of any member of any animal whatever.This case
we shall exemplify by the appearance of the hand.And because any
continued quantity is divisible _ad infinitum_, the motion of the eye
which looks at the hand, and moves from A to B, moves by a space A B,
which is also a continued quantity, and consequently divisible _ad
infinitum_, and in every part of the motion varies to its view the
aspect and figure of the hand; and so it will do if it move round the
whole circle.The same will the hand do which is raised in its motion,
that is, it will pass over a space, which is a continued quantity[24].[Illustration]




/Chap.CI./--_The Motions of Figures._


/Never/ put the head straight upon the shoulders, but a little turned
sideways to the right or left, even though the figures should be
looking up or down, or straight, because it is necessary to give them
some motion of life and spirit.Nor ever compose a figure in such
a manner, either in a front or back view, as that every part falls
straight upon another from the top to the bottom.But if you wish to
introduce such a figure, use it for old age.Never repeat the same
motion of arms, or of legs, not only not in the same figure, but in
those which are standing by, or near; if the necessity of the case,
or the expression of the subject you represent, do not oblige you to
it[25].CII./--_Of common Motions._


/The/ variety of motions in man are equal to the variety of accidents
or thoughts affecting the mind, and each of these thoughts, or
accidents, will operate more or less, according to the temper and age
of the subject; for the same cause will in the actions of youth, or of
old age, produce very different effects.CIII./--_Of simple Motions._


/Simple/ motion is that which a man performs in merely bending
backwards or forwards.CIV./--_Complex Motion._


/Complex/ motion is that which, to produce some particular action,
requires the body to bend downwards and sideways at the same time.The
painter must be careful in his compositions to apply these complex
motions according to the nature of the subject, and not to weaken or
destroy the effect of it by introducing figures with simple motions,
without any connexion with the subject.CV./--_Motions appropriated to the Subject._


/The/ motions of your figures are to be expressive of the quantity of
strength requisite to the force of the action.Let not the same effort
be used to take up a stick as would easily raise a piece of timber.Therefore shew great variety in the expression of strength, according
to the quality of the load to be managed.CVI./--_Appropriate Motions._


/There/ are some emotions of the mind which are not expressed by any
particular motion of the body, while in others, the expression cannot
be shewn without it.In the first, the arms fall down, the hands and
all the other parts, which in general are the most active, remain at
rest.But such emotions of the soul as produce bodily action, must put
the members into such motions as are appropriated to the intention of
the mind.This, however, is an ample subject, and we have a great deal
to say upon it.There is a third kind of motion, which participates
of the two already described; and a fourth, which depends neither on
the one nor the other.This last belongs to insensibility, or fury,
and should be ranked with madness or stupidity; and so adapted only to
grotesque or Moresco work.CVII./--_Of the Postures of Women and young People._


/It/ is not becoming in women and young people to have their legs
too much asunder, because it denotes boldness; while the legs close
together shew modesty.CVIII./--_Of the Postures of Children._


/Children/ and old people are not to express quick motions, in what
concerns their legs.CIX./--_Of the Motion of the Members._


/Let/ every member be employed in performing its proper functions.For
instance, in a dead body, or one asleep, no member should appear alive
or awake.A foot bearing the weight of the whole body, should not be
playing its toes up and down, but flat upon the ground; except when it
rests entirely upon the heel.CX./--_Of mental Motions._


/A mere/ thought, or operation of the mind, excites only simple and
easy motions of the body; not this way, and that way, because its
object is in the mind, which does not affect the senses when it is
collected within itself.CXI./--_Effect of the Mind upon the Motions of the Body,
occasioned by some outward Object._


/When/ the motion is produced by the presence of some object, either
the cause is immediate or not.If it be immediate, the figure will
first turn towards it the organs most necessary, the eyes; leaving its
feet in the same place; and will only move the thighs, hips, and knees
a little towards the same side, to which the eyes are directed.CXII./--_Of those who apply themselves to the Practice, without
having learnt the Theory of the Art._


/Those/ who become enamoured of the practice of the art, without having
previously applied to the diligent study of the scientific part of it,
may be compared to mariners, who put to sea in a ship without rudder or
compass, and therefore cannot be certain of arriving at the wished-for
port.Practice must always be founded on good theory; to this, Perspective is
the guide and entrance, without which nothing can be well done.CXIII./--_Precepts in Painting._


/Perspective/ is to Painting what the bridle is to a horse, and the
rudder to a ship.The size of a figure should denote the distance at which it is situated.If a figure be seen of the natural size, remember that it denotes its
being near to the eye.CXIV./--_Of the Boundaries of Objects called Outlines or
Contours._


/The/ outlines or contours of bodies are so little perceivable, that
at any small distance between that and the object, the eye will not be
able to recognise the features of a friend or relation, if it were not
for their clothes and general appearance.So that by the knowledge of
the whole it comes to know the parts.CXV./--_Of linear Perspective._


/Linear/ Perspective consists in giving, by established rules, the true
dimensions of objects, according to their respective distances; so that
the second object be less than the first, the third than the second,
and by degrees at last they become invisible.I find by experience,
that, if the second object be at the same distance from the first, as
the first is from the eye, though they be of the same size, the second
will appear half the size of the first; and, if the third be at the
same distance behind the second, it will diminish two thirds; and so
on, by degrees, they will, at equal distances, diminish in proportion;
provided that the interval be not more than twenty cubits[26]; at
which distance it will lose two fourths of its size: at forty it will
diminish three fourths; and at sixty it will lose five sixths, and so
on progressively.But you must be distant from your picture twice the
size of it; for, if you be only once the size, it will make a great
difference in the measure from the first to the second.CXVI./--_What Parts of Objects disappear first by Distance._


/Those/ parts which are of less magnitude will first vanish from the
sight[27].This happens, because the shape of small objects, at an
equal distance, comes to the eye under a more acute angle than the
large ones, and the perception of them is less, in proportion as they
are less in magnitude.It follows then, that if the large objects, by
being removed to a great distance, and consequently coming to the eye
by a small angle, are almost lost to the sight, the small objects will
entirely disappear.CXVII./--_Of remote Objects._


/The/ outlines of objects will be less seen, in proportion as they are
more distant from the eye.CXVIII./--_Of the Point of Sight._


/The/ point of sight must be on a level with the eyes of a common-sized
man, and placed upon the horizon, which is the line formed by a flat
country terminating with the sky.An exception must be made as to
mountains, which are above that line.CXIX./--_A Picture is to be viewed from one Point only._


/This/ will be proved by one single example.If you mean to represent
a round ball very high up, on a flat and perpendicular wall, it will
be necessary to make it oblong, like the shape of an egg, and to place
yourself (that is, the eye, or point of view) so far back, as that its
outline or circumference may appear round.CXX./--_Of the Dimensions of the first Figure in an historical
Painting._


/The/ first figure in your picture will be less than Nature, in
proportion as it recedes from the front of the picture, or the bottom
line; and by the same rule the others behind it will go on lessening in
an equal degree[28].CXXI./--_Of Objects that are lost to the Sight in Proportion to
their Distance._


/The/ first things that disappear, by being removed to some distance,
are the outlines or boundaries of objects.The second, as they remove
farther, are the shadows which divide contiguous bodies.The third
are the thickness of legs and feet; and so in succession the small
parts are lost to the sight, till nothing remains but a confused mass,
without any distinct parts.CXXII./--_Errors not so easily seen in small Objects as in large
ones._


/Supposing/ this small object to represent a man, or any other animal,
although the parts, by being so much diminished or reduced, cannot be
executed with the same exactness of proportion, nor finished with the
same accuracy, as if on a larger scale, yet on that very account the
faults will be less conspicuous.For example, if you look at a man at
the distance of two hundred yards, and with all due attention mean to
form a judgment, whether he be handsome or ugly, deformed or well made,
you will find that, with all your endeavours, you can hardly venture
to decide.The reason is, that the man diminishes so much by the
distance, that it is impossible to distinguish the parts minutely.If
you wish to know by demonstration the diminution of the above figure,
hold your finger up before your eye at about nine inches distance, so
that the top of your finger corresponds with the top of the head of
the distant figure: you will perceive that your finger covers, not
only its head, but part of its body; which is an evident proof of the
apparent diminution of that object.Hence it often happens, that we are
doubtful, and can scarcely, at some distance, distinguish the form of
even a friend.CXXIII./--_Historical Subjects one above another on the same
Wall to be avoided._


/This/ custom, which has been generally adopted by painters, on the
front and sides of chapels, is much to be condemned.They begin with an
historical picture, its landscape and buildings, in one compartment.After which, they raise another compartment, and execute another
history with other buildings upon another level; and from thence they
proceed to a third and fourth, varying the point of sight, as if the
beholder was going up steps, while, in fact, he must look at them all
from below, which is very ill judged in those matters.We know that the point of sight is the eye of the spectator; and if
you ask, how is a series of subjects, such as the life of a saint, to
be represented, in different compartments on the same wall?I answer,
that you are to place the principal event in the largest compartment,
and make the point of sight as high as the eye of the spectator.Begin
that subject with large figures; and as you go up, lessen the objects,
as well the figures, as buildings, varying the plans according to the
effect of perspective; but never varying the point of sight: and so
complete the series of subjects, till you come to a certain height,
where terrestrial objects can be seen no more, except the tops of
trees, or clouds and birds; or if you introduce figures, they must be
aerial, such as angels, or saints in glory, or the like, if they suit
the purpose of your history.If not, do not undertake this kind of
painting, for your work will be faulty, and justly reprehensible[29].CXXIV./--_Why Objects in Painting can never detach, as natural
Objects do._


/Painters/ often despair of being able to imitate Nature, from
observing, that their pictures have not the same relief, nor the same
life, as natural objects have in a looking-glass, though they both
appear upon a plain surface.They say, they have colours which surpass
in brightness the quality of the lights, and in darkness the quality of
the shades of the objects seen in the looking-glass; but attribute this
circumstance to their own ignorance, and not to the true cause, because
they do not know it.It is impossible that objects in painting should
appear with the same relief as those in the looking-glass, unless we
look at them with only one eye.The two eyes A B looking at objects one behind
another, as M and N, see them both; because M cannot entirely occupy
the space of N, by reason that the base of the visual rays is so broad,
that the second object is seen behind the first.But if one eye be
shut, and you look with the other S, the body F will entirely cover
the body R, because the visual rays beginning at one point, form a
triangle, of which the body F is the base, and being prolonged, they
form two diverging tangents at the two extremities of F, which cannot
touch the body R behind it, therefore can never see it[30].[Illustration]




/Chap.CXXV./--_How to give the proper Dimension to Objects in
Painting._


[Illustration]

/In/ order to give the appearance of the natural size, if the piece
be small (as miniatures), the figures on the fore-ground are to be
finished with as much precision as those of any large painting, because
being small they are to be brought up close to the eye.But large
paintings are seen at some distance; whence it happens, that though
the figures in each are so different in size, in appearance they will
be the same.This proceeds from the eye receiving those objects under
the same angle; and it is proved thus.Let the large painting be B C,
the eye A, and D E a pane of glass, through which are seen the figures
situated at B C. I say that the eye being fixed, the figures in the
copy of the paintings B C are to be smaller, in proportion as the glass
D E is nearer the eye A, and are to be as precise and finished.But if
you will execute the picture B C upon the glass D E, this ought to be
less finished than the picture B C, and more so than the figure M N
transferred upon the glass F G; because, supposing the figure P O to
be as much finished as the natural one in B C, the perspective of O P
would be false, since, though in regard to the diminution of the figure
it would be right, B C being diminished in P O, the finishing would not
agree with the distance, because in giving it the perfection of the
natural B C, B C would appear as near as O P; but, if you search for
the diminution of O P, O P will be found at the distance B C, and the
diminution of the finishing as at F G.CXXVI./--_How to draw accurately any particular Spot._


/Take/ a glass as large as your paper, fasten it well between your eye
and the object you mean to draw, and fixing your head in a frame (in
such a manner as not to be able to move it) at the distance of two
feet from the glass; shut one eye, and draw with a pencil accurately
upon the glass all that you see through it.After that, trace upon
paper what you have drawn on the glass, which tracing you may paint at
pleasure, observing the aerial perspective.CXXVII./--_Disproportion to be avoided, even in the accessory
Parts._


/A great/ fault is committed by many painters, which is highly to be
blamed, that is, to represent the habitations of men, and other parts
of their compositions, so low, that the doors do not reach as high as
the knees of their inhabitants, though, according to their situation,
they are nearer to the eye of the spectator, than the men who seem
willing to enter them.I have seen some pictures with porticos,
supported by columns loaded with figures; one grasping a column against
which it leans, as if it were a walking-stick, and other similar
errors, which are to be avoided with the greatest care.INVENTION, /or/ COMPOSITION.CXXVIII./--_Precept for avoiding a bad Choice in the Style or
Proportion of Figures._


/The/ painter ought to form his style upon the most proportionate
model in Nature; and after having measured that, he ought to measure
himself also, and be perfectly acquainted with his own defects or
deficiencies; and having acquired this knowledge, his constant care
should be to avoid conveying into his work those defects which he has
found in his own person; for these defects, becoming habitual to his
observation, mislead his judgment, and he perceives them no longer.We
ought, therefore, to struggle against such a prejudice, which grows
up with us; for the mind, being fond of its own habitation, is apt to
represent it to our imagination as beautiful.From the same motive it
may be, that there is not a woman, however plain in her person, who may
not find her admirer, if she be not a monster.Against this bent of the
mind you ought very cautiously to be on your guard.CXXIX./--_Variety in Figures._


/A painter/ ought to aim at universal excellence; for he will be
greatly wanting in dignity, if he do one thing well and another badly,
as many do, who study only the naked figure, measured and proportioned
by a pair of compasses in their hands, and do not seek for variety.A
man may be well proportioned, and yet be tall or short, large or lean,
or of a middle size; and whoever does not make great use of these
varieties, which are all existing in Nature in its most perfect state,
will produce figures as if cast in one and the same mould, which is
highly reprehensible.CXXX./--_How a Painter ought to proceed in his Studies._


/The/ painter ought always to form in his mind a kind of system of
reasoning or discussion within himself on any remarkable object
before him.He should stop, take notes, and form some rule upon it;
considering the place, the circumstances, the lights and shadows.CXXXI./--_Of sketching Histories and Figures._


/Sketches/ of historical subjects must be slight, attending only to the
situation of the figures, without regard to the finishing of particular
members, which may be done afterwards at leisure, when the mind is so
disposed.CXXXII./--_How to study Composition._


/The/ young student should begin by sketching slightly some single
figure, and turn that on all sides, knowing already how to contract,
and how to extend the members; after which, he may put two together in
various attitudes, we will suppose in the act of fighting boldly.This
composition also he must try on all sides, and in a variety of ways,
tending to the same expression.Then he may imagine one of them very
courageous, while the other is a coward.Let these attitudes, and many
other accidental affections of the mind, be with great care studied,
examined, and dwelt upon.CXXXIII./--_Of the Attitudes of Men._


/The/ attitudes and all the members are to be disposed in such
a manner, that by them the intentions of the mind may be easily
discovered.CXXXIV./--_Variety of Positions._


/The/ positions of the human figure are to be adapted to the age and
rank; and to be varied according to the difference of the sexes, men or
women.CXXXV./--_Of Studies from Nature for History._


/It/ is necessary to consider well the situation for which the history
is to be painted, particularly the height; and let the painter place
accordingly the model, from which he means to make his studies for that
historical picture; and set himself as much below the object, as the
picture is to be above the eye of the spectator, otherwise the work
will be faulty.CXXXVI./--_Of the Variety of Figures in History Painting._


/History/ painting must exhibit variety in its fullest extent.In
temper, size, complexion, actions, plumpness, leanness, thick, thin,
large, small, rough, smooth, old age and youth, strong and muscular,
weak, with little appearance of muscles, cheerfulness and melancholy.Some should be with curled hair, and some with straight; some short,
some long, some quick in their motions, and some slow, with a variety
of dresses and colours, according as the subject may require.CXXXVII./--_Of Variety in History._


/A painter/ should delight in introducing great variety into his
compositions, avoiding repetition, that by this fertility of invention
he may attract and charm the eye of the beholder.If it be requisite
according to the subject meant to be represented, that there should be
a mixture of men differing in their faces, ages, and dress, grouped
with women, children, dogs, and horses, buildings, hills and flat
country; observe dignity and decorum in the principal figure; such
as a king, magistrate, or philosopher, separating them from the low
classes of the people.Mix not afflicted or weeping figures with joyful
and laughing ones; for Nature dictates that the cheerful be attended
by others of the same disposition of mind.Laughter is productive of
laughter, and _vice versa_.CXXXVIII./--_Of the Age of Figures._


/Do/ not bring together a number of boys with as many old men, nor
young men with infants, nor women with men; if the subject you mean to
represent does not oblige you to it.CXXXIX./--_Of Variety of Faces._


/The/ Italian painters have been accused of a common fault, that is,
of introducing into their compositions the faces, and even the whole
figures, of Roman emperors, which they take from the antique.To
avoid such an error, let no repetition take place, either in parts,
or the whole of a figure; nor let there be even the same face in
another composition: and the more the figures are contrasted, viz.the
deformed opposed to the beautiful, the old to the young, the strong
to the feeble, the more the picture will please and be admired.These
different characters, contrasted with each other, will increase the
beauty of the whole.It frequently happens that a painter, while he is composing, will use
any little sketch or scrap of drawing he has by him, and endeavour to
make it serve his purpose; but this is extremely injudicious, because
he may very often find that the members he has drawn have not the
motion suited to what he means to express; and after he has adopted,
accurately drawn, and even well finished them, he will be loth to rub
out and change them for others.CXL./--_A Fault in Painters._


/It/ is a very great fault in a painter to repeat the same motions in
figures, and the same folds in draperies in the same composition, as
also to make all the faces alike.CXLI./--_How you may learn to compose Groups for History
Painting._


/When/ you are well instructed in perspective, and know perfectly how
to draw the anatomy and forms of different bodies or objects, it should
be your delight to observe and consider in your walks the different
actions of men, when they are talking, or quarrelling; when they laugh,
and when they fight.Attend to their positions, and to those of the
spectators; whether they are attempting to separate those who fight,
or merely lookers-on.Be quick in sketching these with slight strokes
in your pocket-book, which should always be about you, and made of
stained paper, as you ought not to rub out.When it is full, take
another, for these are not things to be rubbed out, but kept with the
greatest care; because forms and motions of bodies are so infinitely
various, that the memory is not able to retain them; therefore preserve
these sketches as your assistants and masters.CXLII./--_How to study the Motions of the human Body._


/The/ first requisite towards a perfect acquaintance with the various
motions of the human body, is the knowledge of all the parts,
particularly the joints, in all the attitudes in which it may be
placed.Then make slight sketches in your pocket-book, as opportunities
occur, of the actions of men, as they happen to meet your eye, without
being perceived by them; because, if they were to observe you, they
would be disturbed from that freedom of action, which is prompted by
inward feeling; as when two men are quarrelling and angry, each of
them seeming to be in the right, and with great vehemence move their
eyebrows, arms, and all the other members, using motions appropriated
to their words and feelings.This they could not do, if you wanted them
to imitate anger, or any other accidental emotion; such as laughter,
weeping, pain, admiration, fear, and the like.For that reason, take
care never to be without a little book, for the purpose of sketching
those various motions, and also groups of people standing by.This
will teach you how to compose history.Two things demand the principal
attention of a good painter.One is the exact outline and shape of the
figure; the other, the true expression of what passes in the mind of
that figure, which he must feel, and that is very important.CXLIII./--_Of Dresses, and of Draperies and Folds._


/The/ draperies with which you dress figures ought to have their
folds so accommodated as to surround the parts they are intended to
cover; that in the mass of light there be not any dark fold, and in
the mass of shadows none receiving too great a light.They must go
gently over, describing the parts; but not with lines across, cutting
the members with hard notches, deeper than the part can possibly
be; at the same time, it must fit the body, and not appear like an
empty bundle of cloth; a fault of many painters, who, enamoured of
the quantity and variety of folds, have encumbered their figures,
forgetting the intention of clothes, which is to dress and surround the
parts gracefully wherever they touch; and not to be filled with wind,
like bladders, puffed up where the parts project.I do not deny that
we ought not to neglect introducing some handsome folds among these
draperies, but it must be done with great judgment, and suited to the
parts, where, by the actions of the limbs and position of the whole
body, they gather together.Above all, be careful to vary the quality
and quantity of your folds in compositions of many figures; so that,
if some have large folds, produced by thick woollen cloth; others,
being dressed in thinner stuff, may have them narrower; some sharp and
straight, others soft and undulating.CXLIV./--_Of the Nature of Folds in Draperies._


/Many/ painters prefer making the folds of their draperies with acute
angles, deep and precise; others with angles hardly perceptible; and
some with none at all; but instead of them, certain curved lines.CXLV./--_How the Folds of Draperies ought to be represented_,
Plate XVIII./That/ part of the drapery, which is the farthest from the place where
it is gathered, will appear more approaching its natural state.Every
thing naturally inclines to preserve its primitive form.Therefore a
stuff or cloth, which is of equal thickness on both sides, will always
incline to remain flat.For that reason, when it is constrained by some
fold to relinquish its flat situation, it is observed that, at the part
of its greatest restraint, it is continually making efforts to return
to its natural shape; and the parts most distant from it reassume more
of their primitive state by ample and distended folds.For example, let
A B C be the drapery mentioned above; A B the place where it is folded
or restrained.I have said that the part, which is farthest from the
place of its restraint, would return more towards its primitive shape.Therefore C being the farthest, will be broader and more extended than
any other part._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]

[Illustration:
_Page 69_._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.CXLVI./--_How the Folds in Draperies ought to be made._


/Draperies/ are not to be encumbered with many folds: on the contrary,
there ought to be some only where they are held up with the hands or
arms of the figures, and the rest left to fall with natural simplicity.They ought to be studied from Nature; that is to say, if a woollen
cloth be intended, the folds ought to be drawn after such cloth; if it
be of silk, or thin stuff, or else very thick for labourers, let it
be distinguished by the nature of the folds.But never copy them, as
some do, after models dressed in paper, or thin leather, for it greatly
misleads.CXLVII./--_Fore-shortening of Folds_, Plate XIX./Where/ the figure is fore-shortened, there ought to appear a greater
number of folds, than on the other parts, all surrounding it in a
circular manner.M N will have the
middle of every circular fold successively removed farther from its
outline, in proportion as it is more distant from the eye.In M O of
the other figure the outlines of these circular folds will appear
almost straight, because it is situated opposite the eye; but in P and
Q quite the contrary, as in N and M.CXLVIII./--_Of Folds._


/The/ folds of draperies, whatever be the motion of the figure, ought
always to shew, by the form of their outlines, the attitude of such
figure; so as to leave, in the mind of the beholder, no doubt or
confusion in regard to the true position of the body; and let there be
no fold, which, by its shadow, breaks through any of the members; that
is to say, appearing to go in deeper than the surface of the part it
covers.And if you represent the figure clothed with several garments,
one over the other, let it not appear as if the upper one covered only
a mere skeleton; but let it express that it is also well furnished with
flesh, and a thickness of folds, suitable to the number of its under
garments.The folds surrounding the members ought to diminish in thickness near
the extremities of the part they surround.The length of the folds, which are close to the members, ought to
produce other folds on that side where the member is diminished by
fore-shortening, and be more extended on the opposite side.CXLIX./--_Of Decorum._


/Observe/ decorum in every thing you represent, that is, fitness of
action, dress, and situation, according to the dignity or meanness of
the subject to be represented.Be careful that a king, for instance,
be grave and majestic in his countenance and dress; that the place be
well decorated; and that his attendants, or the by-standers, express
reverence and admiration, and appear as noble, in dresses suitable to a
royal court.On the contrary, in the representation of a mean subject, let the
figures appear low and despicable; those about them with similar
countenances, and actions, denoting base and presumptuous minds, and
meanly clad.In short, in both cases, the parts must correspond with
the general sentiment of the composition.The motions of old age should not be similar to those of youth; those
of a woman to those of a man; nor should the latter be the same as
those of a boy.CL./--_The Character of Figures in Composition._


/In/ general, the painter ought to introduce very few old men, in the
ordinary course of historical subjects, and those few separated from
young people; because old people are few, and their habits do not agree
with those of youth.Where there is no conformity of custom, there can
be no intimacy, and, without it, a company is soon separated.But if
the subject require an appearance of gravity, a meeting on important
business, as a council, for instance, let there be few young men
introduced, for youth willingly avoids such meetings.CLI./--_The Motion of the Muscles, when the Figures are in
natural Positions._


/A figure/, which does not express by its position the sentiments and
passions, by which we suppose it animated, will appear to indicate
that its muscles are not obedient to its will, and the painter very
deficient in judgment.For that reason, a figure is to shew great
eagerness and meaning; and its position is to be so well appropriated
to that meaning, that it cannot be mistaken, nor made use of for any
other.CLII./--_A Precept in Painting._


/The/ painter ought to notice those quick motions, which men are apt to
make without thinking, when impelled by strong and powerful affections
of the mind.He ought to take memorandums of them, and sketch them in
his pocket-book, in order to make use of them when they may answer his
purpose; and then to put a living model in the same position, to see
the quality and aspect of the muscles which are in action.CLIII./--_Of the Motion of Man_, Plates XX./The/ first and principal part of the art is composition of any sort,
or putting things together.The second relates to the expression and
motion of the figures, and requires that they be well appropriated,
and seeming attentive to what they are about; appearing to move with
alacrity and spirit, according to the degree of expression suitable
to the occasion; expressing slow and tardy motions, as well as those
of eagerness in pursuit: and that quickness and ferocity be expressed
with such force as to give an idea of the sensations of the actors.When a figure is to throw a dart, stones, or the like, let it be
seen evidently by the attitude and disposition of all the members,
that such is its intention; of which there are two examples in the
opposite plates, varied both in action and power.The first in point
of vigour is A. The second is B. But A will throw his weapon farther
than B, because, though they seem desirous of throwing it to the same
point, A having turned his feet towards the object, while his body is
twisted and bent back the contrary way, to increase his power, returns
with more velocity and force to the point to which he means to throw.But the figure B having turned his feet the same way as his body,
it returns to its place with great inconvenience, and consequently
with weakened powers.For in the expression of great efforts, the
preparatory motions of the body must be strong and violent, twisting
and bending, so that it may return with convenient ease, and by that
means have a great effect.In the same manner, if a cross-bow be not
strung with force, the motion of whatever it shoots will be short and
without effect; because, where there is no impulse, there can be no
motion; and if the impulse be not violent, the motion is but tardy
and feeble.So a bow, which is not strong, has no motion; and, if it
be strung, it will remain in that state till the impulse be given
by another power which puts it in motion, and it will shoot with a
violence equal to that which was employed in bending it.In the same
manner, the man who does not twist and bend his body will have acquired
no power.Therefore, after A has thrown his dart, he will find himself
twisted the contrary way, viz.on the side where he has thrown; and
he will have acquired only power sufficient to serve him to return to
where he was at first._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]

/Chap.CLIV./--_Of Attitudes, and the Motions of the Members._


/The/ same attitude is not to be repeated in the same picture, nor the
same motion of members in the same figure, nay, not even in the hands
or fingers.And if the history requires a great number of figures, such
as a battle, or a massacre of soldiers, in which there are but three
ways of striking, viz.thrusting, cutting, or back-handed; in that
case you must take care, that all those who are cutting be expressed
in different views; some turning their backs, some their sides, and
others be seen in front; varying in the same manner the three different
ways of fighting, so that all the actions may have a relation to those
three principles.In battles, complex motions display great art, giving
spirit and animation to the whole.By complex motion is meant, for
instance, that of a single figure shewing the front of the legs, and at
the same time the profile of the shoulder.But of this I shall treat in
another place[31].CLV./--_Of a single Figure separate from an historical Group._


/The/ same motion of members should not be repeated in a figure which
you mean to be alone; for instance, if the figure be represented
running, it must not throw both hands forward; but one forward and the
other backward, or else it cannot run.If the right foot come forward,
the right arm must go backward and the left forward, because, without
such disposition and contraste of parts, it is impossible to run well.If another figure be supposed to follow this, one of its legs should
be brought somewhat forward, and the other be perpendicular under the
head; the arm on the same side should pass forward.But of this we
shall treat more fully in the book on motion[32].CLVI./--_On the Attitudes of the human Figure._


/A painter/ is to be attentive to the motions and actions of men,
occasioned by some sudden accident.He must observe them on the spot,
take sketches, and not wait till he wants such expression, and then
have it counterfeited for him; for instance, setting a model to weep
when there is no cause; such an expression without a cause will be
neither quick nor natural.But it will be of great use to have observed
every action from nature, as it occurs, and then to have a model set in
the same attitude to help the recollection, and find out something to
the purpose, according to the subject in hand.CLVII./--_How to represent a Storm._


/To/ form a just idea of a storm, you must consider it attentively in
its effects.When the wind blows violently over the sea or land, it
removes and carries off with it every thing that is not firmly fixed
to the general mass.The clouds must appear straggling and broken,
carried according to the direction and the force of the wind, and
blended with clouds of dust raised from the sandy shore.Branches and
leaves of trees must be represented as carried along by the violence
of the storm, and, together with numberless other light substances,
scattered in the air.Trees and grass must be bent to the ground, as if
yielding to the course of the wind.Boughs must be twisted out of their
natural form, with their leaves reversed and entangled.Of the figures
dispersed in the picture, some should appear thrown on the ground, so
wrapped up in their cloaks and covered with dust, as to be scarcely
distinguishable.Of those who remain on their feet, some should be
sheltered by and holding fast behind some great trees, to avoid the
same fate: others bending to the ground, their hands over their faces
to ward off the dust; their hair and their clothes flying straight up
at the mercy of the wind.The high tremendous waves of the stormy sea will be covered with
foaming froth; the most subtle parts of which, being raised by the
wind, like a thick mist, mix with the air.What vessels are seen should
appear with broken cordage, and torn sails, fluttering in the wind;
some with broken masts fallen across the hulk, already on its side
amidst the tempestuous waves.Some of the crew should be represented as
if crying aloud for help, and clinging to the remains of the shattered
vessel.Let the clouds appear as driven by tempestuous winds against
the summits of lofty mountains, enveloping those mountains, and
breaking and recoiling with redoubled force, like waves against a rocky
shore.The air should be rendered awfully dark, by the mist, dust, and
thick clouds.CLVIII./--_How to compose a Battle._


/First/, let the air exhibit a confused mixture of smoke, arising from
the discharge of artillery and musquetry, and the dust raised by the
horses of the combatants; and observe, that dust being of an earthy
nature, is heavy; but yet, by reason of its minute particles, it is
easily impelled upwards, and mixes with the air; nevertheless, it
naturally falls downwards again, the most subtle parts of it alone
gaining any considerable degree of elevation, and at its utmost height
it is so thin and transparent, as to appear nearly of the colour of
the air.The smoke, thus mixing with the dusty air, forms a kind of
dark cloud, at the top of which it is distinguished from the dust by a
blueish cast, the dust retaining more of its natural colour.On that
part from which the light proceeds, this mixture of air, smoke, and
dust, will appear much brighter than on the opposite side.The more the
combatants are involved in this turbulent mist, the less distinctly
they will be seen, and the more confused will they be in their lights
and shades.Let the faces of the musketeers, their bodies, and every
object near them, be tinged with a reddish hue, even the air or cloud
of dust; in short, all that surrounds them.This red tinge you will
diminish, in proportion to their distance, from the primary cause.The
groups of figures, which appear at a distance between the spectator
and the light, will form a dark mass upon a light ground; and their
legs will be more undetermined and lost as they approach nearer to the
ground; because there the dust is heavier and thicker.If you mean to represent some straggling horses, running out of the
main body, introduce also some small clouds of dust, as far distant
from each other as the leap of the horse, and these little clouds will
become fainter, more scanty, and diffused, in proportion to their
distance from the horse.That nearest to his feet will consequently be
the most determined, smallest, and the thickest of all.Let the air be full of arrows, in all directions; some ascending, some
falling down, and some darting straight forwards.The bullets of the
musketry, though not seen, will be marked in their course by a train
of smoke, which breaks through the general confusion.The figures in
the fore-ground should have their hair covered with dust, as also their
eyebrows, and all parts liable to receive it.The victorious party will be running forwards, their hair and other
light parts flying in the wind, their eyebrows lowered, and the motion
of every member properly contrasted; for instance, in moving the right
foot forwards, the left arm must be brought forwards also.If you make
any of them fallen down, mark the trace of his fall on the slippery,
gore-stained dust; and where the ground is less impregnated with blood,
let the print of men's feet and of horses, that have passed that
way, be marked.Let there be some horses dragging the bodies of their
riders, and leaving behind them a furrow, made by the body thus trailed
along.The countenances of the vanquished will appear pale and dejected.Their
eyebrows raised, and much wrinkled about the forehead and cheeks.The tip of their noses somewhat divided from the nostrils by arched
wrinkles terminating at the corner of the eyes, those wrinkles being
occasioned by the opening and raising of the nostrils; the upper
lips turned up, discovering the teeth.Their mouths wide open, and
expressive of violent lamentation.One may be seen fallen wounded
on the ground, endeavouring with one hand to support his body, and
covering his eyes with the other, the palm of which is turned towards
the enemy.Others running away, and with open mouths seeming to cry
aloud.Between the legs of the combatants let the ground be strewed
with all sorts of arms; as broken shields, spears, swords, and the
like.Many dead bodies should be introduced, some entirely covered
with dust, others in part only; let the blood, which seems to issue
immediately from the wound, appear of its natural colour, and running
in a winding course, till, mixing with the dust, it forms a reddish
kind of mud.Some should be in the agonies of death; their teeth shut,
their eyes wildly staring, their fists clenched, and their legs in a
distorted position.Some may appear disarmed, and beaten down by the
enemy, still fighting with their fists and teeth, and endeavouring
to take a passionate, though unavailing revenge.There may be also a
straggling horse without a rider, running in wild disorder; his mane
flying in the wind, beating down with his feet all before him, and
doing a deal of damage.A wounded soldier may also be seen falling to
the ground, and attempting to cover himself with his shield, while an
enemy bending over him endeavours to give him the finishing stroke.Several dead bodies should be heaped together under a dead horse.Some
of the conquerors, as having ceased fighting, may be wiping their faces
from the dirt, collected on them by the mixture of dust with the water
from their eyes.The _corps de reserve_ will be seen advancing gaily, but cautiously,
their eyebrows directed forwards, shading their eyes with their hands
to observe the motions of the enemy, amidst clouds of dust and smoke,
and seeming attentive to the orders of their chief.You may also make
their commander holding up his staff, pushing forwards, and pointing
towards the place where they are wanted.A river may likewise be
introduced, with horses fording it, dashing the water about between
their legs, and in the air, covering all the adjacent ground with water
and foam.Not a spot is to be left without some marks of blood and
carnage.CLIX./--_The Representation of an Orator and his Audience._


/If/ you have to represent a man who is speaking to a large assembly of
people, you are to consider the subject matter of his discourse, and
to adapt his attitude to such subject.If he means to persuade, let it
be known by his gesture.If he is giving an explanation, deduced from
several reasons, let him put two fingers of the right hand within one
of the left, having the other two bent close, his face turned towards
the audience, with the mouth half open, seeming to speak.If he is
sitting, let him appear as going to raise himself up a little, and his
head be forward.But if he is represented standing, let him bend his
chest and his head forward towards the people.The auditory are to appear silent and attentive, with their eyes upon
the speaker, in the act of admiration.There should be some old men,
with their mouths close shut, in token of approbation, and their lips
pressed together, so as to form wrinkles at the corners of the mouth,
and about the cheeks, and forming others about the forehead, by raising
the eyebrows, as if struck with astonishment.Some others of those
sitting by, should be seated with their hands within each other, round
one of their knees; some with one knee upon the other, and upon that,
one hand receiving the elbow, the other supporting the chin, covered
with a venerable beard.CLX./--_Of demonstrative Gestures._


/The/ action by which a figure points at any thing near, either in
regard to time or situation, is to be expressed by the hand very little
removed from the body.But if the same thing is far distant, the hand
must also be far removed from the body, and the face of the figure
pointing, must be turned towards those to whom he is pointing it out.CLXI./--_Of the Attitudes of the By-standers at some remarkable
Event._


/All/ those who are present at some event deserving notice, express
their admiration, but in various manners.As when the hand of justice
punishes some malefactor.If the subject be an act of devotion, the
eyes of all present should be directed towards the object of their
adoration, aided by a variety of pious actions with the other members;
as at the elevation of the host at mass, and other similar ceremonies.If it be a laughable subject, or one exciting compassion and moving to
tears, in those cases it will not be necessary for all to have their
eyes turned towards the object, but they will express their feelings
by different actions; and let there be several assembled in groups, to
rejoice or lament together.If the event be terrific, let the faces of
those who run away from the fight, be strongly expressive of fright,
with various motions; as shall be described in the tract on Motion.CLXII./--_How to represent Night._


/Those/ objects which are entirely deprived of light, are lost to the
sight, as in the night; therefore if you mean to paint a history under
those circumstances, you must suppose a large fire, and those objects
that are near it to be tinged with its colour, and the nearer they are
the more they will partake of it.The fire being red, all those objects
which receive light from it will appear of a reddish colour, and
those that are most distant from it will partake of the darkness that
surrounds them.The figures which are represented before the fire will
appear dark in proportion to the brightness of the fire, because those
parts of them which we see, are tinged by that darkness of the night,
and not by the light of the fire, which they intercept.Those that are
on either side of the fire, will be half in the shade of night, and
half in the red light.Those seen beyond the extent of the flames,
will be all of a reddish light upon a black ground.In regard to their
attitudes, let those who are nearest the fire, make screens of their
hands and cloaks, against the scorching heat, with their faces turned
on the contrary side, as if ready to run away from it.The most remote
will only be shading their eyes with their hands, as if hurt by the too
great glare.CLXIII./--_The Method of awakening the Mind to a Variety of
Inventions._


/I will/ not omit to introduce among these precepts a new kind of
speculative invention, which though apparently trifling, and almost
laughable, is nevertheless of great utility in assisting the genius to
find variety for composition.By looking attentively at old and smeared walls, or stones and veined
marble of various colours, you may fancy that you see in them several
compositions, landscapes, battles, figures in quick motion, strange
countenances, and dresses, with an infinity of other objects.By these
confused lines the inventive genius is excited to new exertions.CLXIV./--_Of Composition in History._


/When/ the painter has only a single figure to represent, he must avoid
any shortening whatever, as well of any particular member, as of the
whole figure, because he would have to contend with the prejudices of
those who have no knowledge in that branch of the art.But in subjects
of history, composed of many figures, shortenings may be introduced
with great propriety, nay, they are indispensable, and ought to be used
without reserve, as the subject may require; particularly in battles,
where of course many shortenings and contortions of figures happen,
amongst such an enraged multitude of actors, possessed, as it were, of
a brutal madness.EXPRESSION /and/ CHARACTER.CLXV./--_Of expressive Motions._


/Let/ your figures have actions appropriated to what they are intended
to think or say, and these will be well learnt by imitating the deaf,
who by the motion of their hands, eyes, eyebrows, and the whole body,
endeavour to express the sentiments of their mind.Do not ridicule the
thought of a master without a tongue teaching you an art he does not
understand; he will do it better by his expressive motions, than all
the rest by their words and examples.Let then the painter, of whatever
school, attend well to this maxim, and apply it to the different
qualities of the figures he represents, and to the nature of the
subject in which they are actors.CLXVI./--_How to paint Children._


/Children/ are to be represented with quick and contorted motions,
when they are sitting; but when standing, with fearful and timid
motions.CLXVII./--_How to represent old Men._


/Old/ men must have slow and heavy motions; their legs and knees must
be bent when they are standing, and their feet placed parallel and wide
asunder.Let them be bowed downwards, the head leaning much forward,
and their arms very little extended.CLXVIII./--_How to paint old Women._


/Old/ women, on the contrary, are to be represented bold and quick,
with passionate motions, like furies[33].But the motions are to appear
a great deal quicker in their arms than in their legs.CLXIX./--_How to paint Women._


/Women/ are to be represented in modest and reserved attitudes, with
their knees rather close, their arms drawing near each other, or folded
about the body; their heads looking downwards, and leaning a little on
one side.CLXX./--_Of the Variety of Faces._


/The/ countenances of your figures should be expressive of their
different situations: men at work, at rest, weeping, laughing, crying
out, in fear, or joy, and the like.The attitudes also, and all the
members, ought to correspond with the sentiment expressed in the faces.CLXXI./--_The Parts of the Face, and their Motions._


/The/ motions of the different parts of the face, occasioned by sudden
agitations of the mind, are many.The principal of these are, Laughter,
Weeping, Calling out, Singing, either in a high or low pitch,
Admiration, Anger, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Pain, and others, of which
I propose to treat.First, of Laughing and Weeping, which are very
similar in the motion of the mouth, the cheeks, the shutting of the
eyebrows, and the space between them; as we shall explain in its place,
in treating of the changes which happen in the face, hands, fingers,
and all the other parts of the body, as they are affected by the
different emotions of the soul; the knowledge of which is absolutely
necessary to a painter, or else his figures may be said to be twice
dead.But it is very necessary also that he be careful not to fall into
the contrary extreme; giving extraordinary motions to his figures, so
that in a quiet and peaceable subject, he does not seem to represent a
battle, or the revellings of drunken men: but, above all, the actors in
any point of history must be attentive to what they are about, or to
what is going forward; with actions that denote admiration, respect,
pain, suspicion, fear, and joy, according as the occasion, for which
they are brought together, may require.Endeavour that different points
of history be not placed one above the other on the same canvass, nor
walls with different horizons[34], as if it were a jeweller's shop,
shewing the goods in different square caskets.CLXXII./--_Laughing and Weeping._


/Between/ the expression of laughter and that of weeping there is no
difference in the motion of the features either in the eyes, mouth,
or cheeks; only in the ruffling of the brows, which is added when
weeping, but more elevated and extended in laughing.One may represent
the figure weeping as tearing his clothes, or some other expression,
as various as the cause of his feeling may be; because some weep
for anger, some through fear, others for tenderness and joy, or for
suspicion; some for real pain and torment; whilst others weep through
compassion, or regret at the loss of some friend and near relation.These different feelings will be expressed by some with marks of
despair, by others with moderation; some only shed tears, others cry
aloud, while another has his face turned towards heaven, with his
hand depressed, and his fingers twisted.Some again will be full of
apprehension, with their shoulders raised up to their ears, and so on,
according to the above causes.Those who weep, raise the brows, and bring them close together above
the nose, forming many wrinkles on the forehead, and the corners of the
mouth are turned downwards.Those who laugh have them turned upwards,
and the brows open and extended.CLXXIII./--_Of Anger._


/If/ you represent a man in a violent fit of anger, make him seize
another by the hair, holding his head writhed down against the ground,
with his knee fixed upon the ribs of his antagonist; his right arm up,
and his fist ready to strike; his hair standing on end, his eyebrows
low and straight; his teeth close, and seen at the corner of the mouth;
his neck swelled, and his body covered in the Abdomen with creases,
occasioned by his bending over his enemy, and the excess of his passion.CLXXIV./--_Despair._


/The/ last act of despondency is, when a man is in the act of putting a
period to his own existence.He should be represented with a knife in
one hand, with which he has already inflicted the wound, and tearing it
open with the other.He
will be standing with his feet asunder, his knees a little bent, and
his body leaning forward, as if ready to fall to the ground.CLXXV./--_The Course of Study to be pursued._


/The/ student who is desirous of making great proficiency in the art
of imitating the works of Nature, should not only learn the shape of
figures or other objects, and be able to delineate them with truth and
precision, but he must also accompany them with their proper lights and
shadows, according to the situation in which those objects appear.CLXXVI./--_Which of the two is the most useful Knowledge, the
Outlines of Figures, or that of Light and Shadow._


/The/ knowledge of the outline is of most consequence, and yet may be
acquired to great certainty by dint of study; as the outlines of the
different parts of the human figure, particularly those which do not
bend, are invariably the same.But the knowledge of the situation,
quality, and quantity of shadows, being infinite, requires the most
extensive study.CLXXVII./--_Which is the most important, the Shadows or Outlines
in Painting._


/It/ requires much more observation and study to arrive at perfection
in the shadowing of a picture, than in merely drawing the lines of it.The proof of this is, that the lines may be traced upon a veil or a
flat glass placed between the eye and the object to be imitated.But
that cannot be of any use in shadowing, on account of the infinite
gradation of shades, and the blending of them, which does not allow of
any precise termination; and most frequently they are confused, as will
be demonstrated in another place[35].CLXXVIII./--_What is a Painter's first Aim, and Object._


/The/ first object of a painter is to make a simple flat surface appear
like a relievo, and some of its parts detached from the ground; he
who excels all others in that part of the art, deserves the greatest
praise.This perfection of the art depends on the correct distribution
of lights and shades, called _Chiaro-scuro_.If the painter then avoids
shadows, he may be said to avoid the glory of the art, and to render
his work despicable to real connoisseurs, for the sake of acquiring the
esteem of vulgar and ignorant admirers of fine colours, who never have
any knowledge of relievo.CLXXIX./--_The Difference of Superficies, in regard to Painting._


/Solid/ bodies are of two sorts: the one has the surface curvilinear,
oval, or spherical; the other has several surfaces, or sides producing
angles, either regular or irregular.Spherical, or oval bodies, will
always appear detached from their ground, though they are exactly of
the same colour.Bodies also of different sides and angles will always
detach, because they are always disposed so as to produce shades on
some of their sides, which cannot happen to a plain superficies[36].CLXXX./--_How a Painter may become universal._


/The/ painter who wishes to be universal, and please a variety of
judges, must unite in the same composition, objects susceptible of
great force in the shadows, and great sweetness in the management of
them; accounting, however, in every instance, for such boldness and
softenings.CLXXXI./--_Accuracy ought to be learnt before Dispatch in the
Execution._


/If/ you wish to make good and useful studies, use great deliberation
in your drawings, observe well among the lights which, and how many,
hold the first rank in point of brightness; and so among the shadows,
which are darker than others, and in what manner they blend together;
compare the quality and quantity of one with the other, and observe
to what part they are directed.Be careful also in your outlines, or
divisions of the members.Remark well what quantity of parts are to be
on one side, and what on the other; and where they are more or less
apparent, or broad, or slender.Lastly, take care that the shadows and
lights be united, or lost in each other; without any hard strokes, or
lines: as smoke loses itself in the air, so are your lights and shadows
to pass from the one to the other, without any apparent separation.When you have acquired the habit, and formed your hand to accuracy,
quickness of execution will come of itself[37].CLXXXII./--_How the Painter is to place himself in regard to the
Light, and his Model._


/Let/ A B be the window, M the centre of it, C the model.The best
situation for the painter will be a little sideways, between the window
and his model, as D, so that he may see his object partly in the light
and partly in the shadow.[Illustration]




/Chap.CLXXXIII./--_Of the best Light._


/The/ light from on high, and not too powerful, will be found the best
calculated to shew the parts to advantage.CLXXXIV./--_Of Drawing by Candle-light._


/To/ this artificial light apply a paper blind, and you will see the
shadows undetermined and soft.CLXXXV./--_Of those Painters who draw at Home from one Light,
and afterwards adapt their Studies to another Situation in the Country,
and a different Light._


/It/ is a great error in some painters who draw a figure from Nature at
home, by any particular light, and afterwards make use of that drawing
in a picture representing an open country, which receives the general
light of the sky, where the surrounding air gives light on all sides.This painter would put dark shadows, where Nature would either produce
none, or, if any, so very faint as to be almost imperceptible; and he
would throw reflected lights where it is impossible there should be any.CLXXXVI./--_How high the Light should be in drawing from Nature._


/To/ paint well from Nature, your window should be to the North, that
the lights may not vary.If it be to the South, you must have paper
blinds, that the sun, in going round, may not alter the shadows.The
situation of the light should be such as to produce upon the ground a
shadow from your model as long as that is high.CLXXXVII./--_What Light the Painter must make use of to give
most Relief to his Figures._


/The/ figures which receive a particular light shew more relief than
those which receive an universal one; because the particular light
occasions some reflexes, which proceed from the light of one object
upon the shadows of another, and helps to detach it from the dark
ground.But a figure placed in front of a dark and large space, and
receiving a particular light, can receive no reflexion from any other
objects, and nothing is seen of the figure but what the light strikes
on, the rest being blended and lost in the darkness of the back ground.This is to be applied only to the imitation of night subjects with very
little light.CLXXXVIII./--_Advice to Painters._


/Be/ very careful, in painting, to observe, that between the shadows
there are other shadows, almost imperceptible, both for darkness and
shape; and this is proved by the third proposition[38], which says,
that the surfaces of globular or convex bodies have as great a variety
of lights and shadows as the bodies that surround them have.CLXXXIX./--_Of Shadows._


/Those/ shadows which in Nature are undetermined, and the extremities of
which can hardly be perceived, are to be copied in your painting in
the same manner, never to be precisely finished, but left confused and
blended.This apparent neglect will shew great judgment, and be the
ingenious result of your observation of Nature.CXC./--_Of the Kind of Light proper for drawing from Relievos,
or from Nature._


/Lights/ separated from the shadows with too much precision, have a
very bad effect.In order, therefore, to avoid this inconvenience,
if the object be in the open country, you need not let your figures
be illumined by the sun; but may suppose some transparent clouds
interposed, so that the sun not being visible, the termination of the
shadows will be also imperceptible and soft.CXCI./--_Whether the Light should be admitted in Front or
sideways; and which is most pleasing and graceful._


/The/ light admitted in front of heads situated opposite to side walls
that are dark, will cause them to have great relievo, particularly if
the light be placed high; and the reason is, that the most prominent
parts of those faces are illumined by the general light striking them
in front, which light produces very faint shadows on the part where it
strikes; but as it turns towards the sides, it begins to participate
of the dark shadows of the room, which grow darker in proportion as
it sinks into them.Besides, when the light comes from on high, it
does not strike on every part of the face alike, but one part produces
great shadows upon another; as the eyebrows, which deprive the whole
sockets of the eyes of light.The nose keeps it off from great part of
the mouth, and the chin from the neck, and such other parts.This, by
concentrating the light upon the most projecting parts, produces a very
great relief.CXCII./--_Of the Difference of Lights according to the
Situation._


/A small/ light will cast large and determined shadows upon the
surrounding bodies.A large light, on the contrary, will cast small
shadows on them, and they will be much confused in their termination.When a small but strong light is surrounded by a broad but weaker
light, the latter will appear like a demi-tint to the other, as the sky
round the sun.And the bodies which receive the light from the one,
will serve as demi-tints to those which receive the light from the
other.CXCIII./--_How to distribute the Light on Figures._


/The/ lights are to be distributed according to the natural situation
you mean your figures should occupy.If you suppose them in sunshine,
the shades must be dark, the lights broad and extended, and the shadows
of all the surrounding objects distinctly marked upon the ground.If
seen in a gloomy day, there will be very little difference between
the lights and shades, and no shadows at the feet.If the figures
be represented within doors, the lights and shadows will again be
distinctly divided, and produce shadows on the ground.But if you
suppose a paper blind at the window, and the walls painted white,
the effect will be the same as in a gloomy day, when the lights and
shadows have little difference.If the figures are enlightened by the
fire, the lights must be red and powerful, the shadows dark, and the
shadows upon the ground and upon the walls must be precise; observing
that they spread wider as they go off from the body.If the figures
be enlightened, partly by the sky and partly by the fire, that side
which receives the light from the sky will be the brightest, and on
the other side it will be reddish, somewhat of the colour of the fire.Above all, contrive, that your figures receive a broad light, and that
from above; particularly in portraits, because the people we see in the
street receive all the light from above; and it is curious to observe,
that there is not a face ever so well known amongst your acquaintance,
but would be recognised with difficulty, if it were enlightened from
beneath.CXCIV./--_Of the Beauty of Faces._


/You/ must not mark any muscles with hardness of line, but let the
soft light glide upon them, and terminate imperceptibly in delightful
shadows: from this will arise grace and beauty to the face.CXCV./--_How, in drawing a Face, to give it Grace, by the
Management of Light and Shade._


/A face/ placed in the dark part of a room, acquires great additional
grace by means of light and shadow.The shadowed part of the face
blends with the darkness of the ground, and the light part receives
an increase of brightness from the open air, the shadows on this side
becoming almost insensible; and from this augmentation of light and
shadow, the face has much relief, and acquires great beauty.CXCVI./--_How to give Grace and Relief to Faces._


/In/ streets running towards the west, when the sun is in the meridian,
and the walls on each side so high that they cast no reflexions on that
side of the bodies which is in shade, and the sky is not too bright,
we find the most advantageous situation for giving relief and grace to
figures, particularly to faces; because both sides of the face will
participate of the shadows of the walls.The sides of the nose and
the face towards the west, will be light, and the man whom we suppose
placed at the entrance, and in the middle of the street, will see all
the parts of that face, which are before him, perfectly illumined,
while both sides of it, towards the walls, will be in shadow.What
gives additional grace is, that these shades do not appear cutting,
hard, or dry, but softly blended and lost in each other.The reason of
it is, that the light which is spread all over in the air, strikes also
the pavement of the street, and reflecting upon the shady part of the
face, it tinges that slightly with the same hue: while the great light
which comes from above being confined by the tops of houses, strikes
on the face from different points, almost to the very beginning of
the shadows under the projecting parts of the face.It diminishes by
degrees the strength of them, increasing the light till it comes upon
the chin, where it terminates, and loses itself, blending softly into
the shades on all sides.For instance, if such light were A E, the line
F E would give light even to the bottom of the nose.The line C F will
give light only to the under lip; but the line A H would extend the
shadow to all the under parts of the face, and under the chin.In this situation the nose receives a very strong light from all the
points A B C D E.[Illustration]




/Chap.CXCVII./--_Of the Termination of Bodies upon each other._


/When/ a body, of a cylindrical or convex surface, terminates upon
another body of the same colour, it will appear darker on the edge,
than the body upon which it terminates.And any flat body, adjacent to
a white surface, will appear very dark; but upon a dark ground it will
appear lighter than any other part, though the lights be equal.CXCVIII./--_Of the Back-grounds of painted Objects._


/The/ ground which surrounds the figures in any painting, ought to
be darker than the light part of those figures, and lighter than the
shadowed part.CXCIX./--_How to detach and bring forward Figures out of their
Back-ground._


/If/ your figure be dark, place it on a light ground; if it be light,
upon a dark ground; and if it be partly light and partly dark, as is
generally the case, contrive that the dark part of the figure be upon
the light part of the ground, and the light side of it against the
dark[39].CC./--_Of proper Back-grounds._


/It/ is of the greatest importance to consider well the nature of
back-grounds, upon which any opake body is to be placed.In order to
detach it properly, you should place the light part of such opake body
against the dark part of the back-ground, and the dark parts on a light
ground[40]; as in the cut[41].[Illustration]




/Chap.CCI./--_Of the general Light diffused over Figures._


/In/ compositions of many figures and animals, observe, that the parts
of these different objects ought to be darker in proportion as they are
lower, and as they are nearer the middle of the groups, though they
are all of an uniform colour.This is necessary, because a smaller
portion of the sky (from which all bodies are illuminated) can give
light to the lower spaces between these different figures, than to the
upper parts of the spaces.It is proved thus: A B C D is that portion
of the sky which gives light to all the objects beneath; M and N are
the bodies which occupy the space S T R H, in which it is evidently
perceived, that the point F, receiving the light only from the portion
of the sky C D, has a smaller quantity of it than the point E which
receives it from the whole space A B (a larger portion than C D);
therefore it will be lighter in E than in F.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCII./--_Of those Parts in Shadows which appear the darkest at a
Distance._


[Illustration]

/The/ neck, or any other part which is raised straight upwards, and
has a projection over it, will be darker than the perpendicular
front of that projection; and this projecting part will be lighter,
in proportion as it presents a larger surface to the light.For
instance, the recess A receives no light from any part of the sky G
K, but B begins to receive the light from the part of the sky H K,
and C from G K; and the point D receives the whole of F K. Therefore
the chest will be as light as the forehead, nose, and chin.But what
I have particularly to recommend, in regard to faces, is, that you
observe well those different qualities of shades which are lost at
different distances (while there remain only the first and principal
spots or strokes of shades, such as those of the sockets of the eyes,
and other similar recesses, which are always dark), and at last the
whole face becomes obscured; because the greatest lights (being small
in proportion to the demi-tints) are lost.The quality, therefore,
and quantity of the principal lights and shades are by means of great
distance blended together into a general half-tint; and this is the
reason why trees and other objects are found to be in appearance darker
at some distance than they are in reality, when nearer to the eye.But then the air, which interposes between the objects and the eye,
will render them light again by tinging them with azure, rather in the
shades than in the lights; for the lights will preserve the truth of
the different colours much longer.CCIII./--_Of the Eye viewing the Folds of Draperies surrounding
a Figure._


/The/ shadows between the folds of a drapery surrounding the parts of
the human body will be darker as the deep hollows where the shadows are
generated are more directly opposite the eye.This is to be observed
only when the eye is placed between the light and the shady part of the
figure.CCIV./--_Of the Relief of Figures remote from the Eye._


/Any/ opake body appears less relieved in proportion as it is farther
distant from the eye; because the air, interposed between the eye
and such body, being lighter than the shadow of it, it tarnishes and
weakens that shadow, lessens its power, and consequently lessens also
its relief.CCV./--_Of Outlines of Objects on the Side towards the Light._


/The/ extremities of any object on the side which receives the light,
will appear darker if upon a lighter ground, and lighter if seen upon a
darker ground.But if such body be flat, and seen upon a ground equal
in point of light with itself, and of the same colour, such boundaries,
or outlines, will be entirely lost to the sight[42].CCVI./--_How to make Objects detach from their Ground, that is
to say, from the Surface on which they are painted._


/Objects/ contrasted with a light ground will appear much more detached
than those which are placed against a dark one.The reason is, that
if you wish to give relief to your figures, you will make those parts
which are the farthest from the light, participate the least of it;
therefore they will remain the darkest, and every distinction of
outline would be lost in the general mass of shadows.But to give it
grace, roundness, and effect, those dark shades are always attended by
reflexes, or else they would either cut too hard upon the ground, or
stick to it, by the similarity of shade, and relieve the less as the
ground is darker; for at some distance nothing would be seen but the
light parts, therefore your figures would appear mutilated of all that
remains lost in the back-ground.CCVII./--_A Precept._


/Figures/ will have more grace, placed in the open and general light,
than in any particular or small one; because the powerful and
extended light will surround and embrace the objects: and works done
in that kind of light appear pleasant and graceful when placed at a
distance[43], while those which are drawn in a narrow light, will
receive great force of shadow, but will never appear at a great
distance, but as painted objects.CCVIII./--_Of the Interposition of transparent Bodies between
the Eye and the Object._


/The/ greater the transparent interposition is between the eye and the
object, the more the colour of that object will participate of, or be
changed into that of the transparent medium[44].When an opake body is situated between the eye and the luminary, so
that the central line of the one passes also through the centre of the
other, that object will be entirely deprived of light.CCIX./--_Of proper Back-grounds for Figures._


/As/ we find by experience, that all bodies are surrounded by lights
and shadows, I would have the painter to accommodate that part which is
enlightened, so as to terminate upon something dark; and to manage the
dark parts so that they may terminate on a light ground.This will be
of great assistance in detaching and bringing out his figures[45].CCX./--_Of Back-grounds._


/To/ give a great effect to figures, you must oppose to a light one a
dark ground, and to a dark figure a light ground, contrasting white
with black, and black with white.In general, all contraries give a
particular force and brilliancy of effect by their opposition[46].CCXI./--_Of Objects placed on a light Ground, and why such a
Practice is useful in Painting._


/When/ a darkish body terminates upon a light ground, it will appear
detached from that ground; because all opake bodies of a curved
surface are not only dark on that side which receives no light, and
consequently very different from the ground; but even that side of the
curved surface which is enlightened, will not carry its principal light
to the extremities, but have between the ground and the principal light
a certain demi-tint, darker than either the ground or that light.CCXII./--_Of the different Effects of White, according to the
Difference of Back-grounds._


/Any/ thing white will appear whiter, by being opposed to a dark
ground; and, on the contrary, darker upon a light ground.This we learn
from observing snow as it falls; while it is descending it appears
darker against the sky, than when we see it against an open window,
which (owing to the darkness of the inside of the house) makes it
appear very white.Observe also, that snow appears to fall very quick
and in a great quantity when near the eye; but when at some distance,
it seems to come down slowly, and in a smaller quantity[47].CCXIII./--_Of Reverberation._


/Reverberations/ are produced by all bodies of a bright nature, that
have a smooth and tolerably hard surface, which, repelling the light it
receives, makes it rebound like a foot-ball against the first object
opposed to it.CCXIV./--_Where there cannot be any Reverberation of Light._


/The/ surfaces of hard bodies are surrounded by various qualities of
light and shadow.The lights are of two sorts; one is called original,
the other derivative.The original light is that which comes from the
sun, or the brightness of fire, or else from the air.But to return to our definition, I say, there can
be no reflexion on that side which is turned towards any dark body;
such as roofs, either high or low, shrubs, grass, wood, either dry
or green; because, though every individual part of those objects be
turned towards the original light, and struck by it; yet the quantity
of shadow which every one of these parts produces upon the others, is
so great, that, upon the whole, the light, not forming a compact mass,
loses its effect, so that those objects cannot reflect any light upon
the opposite bodies.CCXV./--_In what Part the Reflexes have more or less Brightness._


/The/ reflected lights will be more or less apparent or bright, in
proportion as they are seen against a darker or fainter ground; because
if the ground be darker than the reflex, then this reflex will appear
stronger on account of the great difference of colour.But, on the
contrary, if this reflexion has behind it a ground lighter than itself,
it will appear dark, in comparison to the brightness which is close to
it, and therefore it will be hardly perceptible[48].CCXVI./--_Of the reflected Lights which surround the Shadows._


/The/ reflected lights which strike upon the midst of shadows, will
brighten up or lessen their obscurity in proportion to the strength
of those lights, and their proximity to those shadows.Many painters
neglect this observation, while others attend to and deduce their
practice from it.This difference of opinion and practice divides the
sentiments of artists, so that they blame each other for not thinking
and acting as they themselves do.The best way is to steer a middle
course, and not to admit of any reflected light, but when the cause of
it is evident to every eye; and _vice versa_, if you introduce none
at all, let it appear evident that there was no reasonable cause for
it.In doing so, you will neither be totally blamed nor praised by the
variety of opinion, which, if not proceeding from entire ignorance,
will ensure to you the approbation of both parties.CCXVII./--_Where Reflexes are to be most apparent._


/Of/ all reflected lights, that is to be the most apparent, bold, and
precise, which detaches from the darkest ground; and, on the contrary,
that which is upon a lighter ground will be less apparent.And this
proceeds from the contraste of shades, by which the faintest makes the
dark ones appear still darker; so in contrasted lights, the brightest
cause the others to appear less bright than they really are[49].CCXVIII./--_What Part of a Reflex is to be the lightest._


/That/ part will be the brightest which receives the reflected light
between angles the most nearly equal.For example, let N be the
luminary, and A B the illuminated part of the object, reflecting the
light over all the shady part of the concavity opposite to it.The
light which reflects upon F will be placed between equal angles.But
E at the base will not be reflected by equal angles, as it is evident
that the angle E A B is more obtuse than the angle E B A. The angle
A F B however, though it is between angles of less quality than the
angle E, and has a common base B A, is between angles more nearly equal
than E, therefore it will be lighter in F than in E; and it will also
be brighter, because it is nearer to the part which gives them light.According to the 6th rule[50], which says, that part of the body is to
be the lightest, which is nearest to the luminary.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCXIX./--_Of the Termination of Reflexes on their Grounds._


/The/ termination of a reflected light on a ground lighter than that
reflex, will not be perceivable; but if such a reflex terminates upon a
ground darker than itself, it will be plainly seen; and the more so in
proportion as that ground is darker, and _vice versa_[51].CCXX./--_Of double and treble Reflexions of Light._


/Double/ reflexes are stronger than single ones, and the shadows which
interpose between the common light and these reflexes are very faint.For instance, let A be the luminous body, A N, A S, are the direct
rays, and S N the parts which receive the light from them.O and E are
the places enlightened by the reflexion of that light in those parts.A N E is a single reflex, but A N O, A S O is the double reflex.The
single reflex is that which proceeds from a single light, but the
double reflexion is produced by two different lights.The single one
E is produced by the light striking on B D, while the double one O
proceeds from the enlightened bodies B D and D R co-operating together;
and the shadows which are between N O and S O will be very faint.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCXXI./--_Reflexes in the Water, and particularly those of the
Air._


/The/ only portion of air that will be seen reflected in the water,
will be that which is reflected by the surface of the water to the eye
between equal angles; that is to say, the angle of incidence must be
equal to the angle of reflexion.COLOURS /and/ COLOURING.CCXXII./--_What Surface is best calculated to receive most
Colours._


/White/ is more capable of receiving all sorts of colours, than the
surface of any body whatever, that is not transparent.To prove it, we
shall say, that any void space is capable of receiving what another
space, not void, cannot receive.In the same manner, a white surface,
like a void space, being destitute of any colour, will be fittest to
receive such as are conveyed to it from any other enlightened body, and
will participate more of the colour than black can do; which latter,
like a broken vessel, is not able to contain any thing.CCXXIII./--_What Surface will shew most perfectly its true
Colour._


/That/ opake body will shew its colour more perfect and beautiful,
which has near it another body of the same colour.CCXXIV./--_On what Surfaces the true Colour is least apparent._


/Polished/ and glossy surfaces shew least of their genuine colour.This
is exemplified in the grass of the fields, and the leaves of trees,
which, being smooth and glossy, will reflect the colour of the sun, and
the air, where they strike, so that the parts which receive the light
do not shew their natural colour.CCXXV./--_What Surfaces shew most of their true and genuine
Colour._


/Those/ objects that are the least smooth and polished shew their
natural colours best; as we see in cloth, and in the leaves of such
grass or trees as are of a woolly nature; which, having no lustre,
are exhibited to the eye in their true natural colour; unless that
colour happen to be confused by that of another body casting on them
reflexions of an opposite colour, such as the redness of the setting
sun, when all the clouds are tinged with its colour.CCXXVI./--_Of the Mixture of Colours._


/Although/ the mixture of colours may be extended to an infinite
variety, almost impossible to be described, I will not omit touching
slightly upon it, setting down at first a certain number of simple
colours to serve as a foundation, and with each of these mixing one
of the others; one with one, then two with two, and three with three,
proceeding in this manner to the full mixture of all the colors
together: then I would begin again, mixing two of these colours with
two others, and three with three, four with four, and so on to the end.To these two colours we shall put three; to these three add three more,
and then six, increasing always in the same proportion.I call those simple colours, which are not composed, and cannot be made
or supplied by any mixture of other colours.Black and White are not
reckoned among colours; the one is the representative of darkness, the
other of light: that is, one is a simple privation of light, the other
is light itself.Yet I will not omit mentioning them, because there is
nothing in painting more useful and necessary; since painting is but an
effect produced by lights and shadows, viz.After Black
and White come Blue and Yellow, then Green, and Tawny or Umber, and
then Purple and Red.With these I begin my mixtures, first Black and White, Black and
Yellow, Black and Red; then Yellow and Red: but I shall treat more at
length of these mixtures in a separate work[52], which will be of great
utility, nay very necessary.I shall place this subject between theory
and practice.CCXXVII./--_Of the Colours produced by the Mixture of other
Colours, called secondary Colours._


/The/ first of all simple colours is White, though philosophers will
not acknowledge either White or Black to be colours; because the first
is the cause, or the receiver of colours, the other totally deprived
of them.But as painters cannot do without either, we shall place them
among the others; and according to this order of things, White will
be the first, Yellow the second, Green the third, Blue the fourth,
Red the fifth, and Black the sixth.We shall set down White for the
representative of light, without which no colour can be seen; Yellow
for the earth; Green for water; Blue for air; Red for fire; and Black
for total darkness.If you wish to see by a short process the variety of all the mixed, or
composed colours, take some  glasses, and, through them, look
at all the country round: you will find that the colour of each object
will be altered and mixed with the colour of the glass through which it
is seen; observe which colour is made better, and which is hurt by the
mixture.If the glass be yellow, the colour of the objects may either
be improved, or greatly impaired by it.Black and White will be most
altered, while Green and Yellow will be meliorated.In the same manner
you may go through all the mixtures of colours, which are infinite.Select those which are new and agreeable to the sight; and following
the same method you may go on with two glasses, or three, till you have
found what will best answer your purpose.CCXXVIII./--_Of Verdegris._


/This/ green, which is made of copper, though it be mixed with oil,
will lose its beauty, if it be not varnished immediately.It not only
fades, but, if washed with a sponge and pure water only, it will detach
from the ground upon which it is painted, particularly in damp weather;
because verdegris is produced by the strength of salts, which easily
dissolve in rainy weather, but still more if washed with a wet sponge.CCXXIX./--_How to increase the Beauty of Verdegris._


/If/ you mix with the Verdegris some Caballine Aloe, it will add to it
a great degree of beauty.It would acquire still more from Saffron, if
it did not fade.The quality and goodness of this Aloe will be proved
by dissolving it in warm Brandy.Supposing the Verdegris has already
been used, and the part finished, you may then glaze it thinly with
this dissolved Aloe, and it will produce a very fine colour.This Aloe
may be ground also in oil by itself, or with the Verdegris, or any
other colour, at pleasure.CCXXX./--_How to paint a Picture that will last almost for ever._


/After/ you have made a drawing of your intended picture, prepare a
good and thick priming with pitch and brickdust well pounded; after
which give it a second coat of white lead and Naples yellow; then,
having traced your drawing upon it, and painted your picture, varnish
it with clear and thick old oil, and stick it to a flat glass, or
crystal, with a clear varnish.Another method, which may be better,
is, instead of the priming of pitch and brickdust, take a flat tile
well vitrified, then apply the coat of white and Naples yellow, and all
the rest as before.But before the glass is applied to it, the painting
must be perfectly dried in a stove, and varnished with nut oil and
amber, or else with purified nut oil alone, thickened in the sun[53].CCXXXI./--_The Mode of painting on Canvass, or Linen Cloth_[54]./Stretch/ your canvass upon a frame, then give it a coat of weak size,
let it dry, and draw your outlines upon it.Paint the flesh colours
first; and while it is still fresh or moist, paint also the shadows,
well softened and blended together.The flesh colour may be made with
white, lake, and Naples yellow.The shades with black, umber, and
a little lake; you may, if you please, use black chalk.After you
have softened this first coat, or dead colour, and let it dry, you
may retouch over it with lake and other colours, and gum water that
has been a long while made and kept liquid, because in that state it
becomes better, and does not leave any gloss.Again, to make the shades
darker, take the lake and gum as above, and ink[55]; and with this you
may shade or glaze many colours, because it is transparent; such as
azure, lake, and several others.As for the lights, you may retouch
or glaze them slightly with gum water and pure lake, particularly
vermilion.CCXXXII./--_Of lively and beautiful Colours._


/For/ those colours which you mean should appear beautiful, prepare a
ground of pure white.This is meant only for transparent colours: as
for those that have a body, and are opake, it matters not what ground
they have, and a white one is of no use.This is exemplified by painted
glasses; when placed between the eye and clear air, they exhibit most
excellent and beautiful colours, which is not the case, when they have
thick air, or some opake body behind them.CCXXXIII./--_Of transparent Colours._


/When/ a transparent colour is laid upon another of a different
nature, it produces a mixed colour, different from either of the
simple ones which compose it.This is observed in the smoke coming
out of a chimney, which, when passing before the black soot, appears
blueish, but as it ascends against the blue of the sky, it changes its
appearance into a reddish brown.So the colour lake laid on blue will
turn it to a violet colour; yellow upon blue turns to green; saffron
upon white becomes yellow; white scumbled upon a dark ground appears
blue, and is more or less beautiful, as the white and the ground are
more or less pure.CCXXXIV./--_In what Part a Colour will appear in its greatest
Beauty._


/We/ are to consider here in what part any colour will shew itself in
its most perfect purity; whether in the strongest light or deepest
shadow, in the demi-tint, or in the reflex.It would be necessary to
determine first, of what colour we mean to treat, because different
colours differ materially in that respect.Black is most beautiful
in the shades; white in the strongest light; blue and green in the
half-tint; yellow and red in the principal light; gold in the reflexes;
and lake in the half-tint.CCXXXV./--_How any Colour without Gloss, is more beautiful in
the Lights than in the Shades._


/All/ objects which have no gloss, shew their colours better in the
light than in the shadow, because the light vivifies and gives a true
knowledge of the nature of the colour, while the shadows lower, and
destroy its beauty, preventing the discovery of its nature.If, on the
contrary, black be more beautiful in the shadows, it is because black
is not a colour.CCXXXVI./--_Of the Appearance of Colours._


/The/ lighter a colour is in its nature, the more so it will appear when
removed to some distance; but with dark colours it is quite the reverse.CCXXXVII./--_What Part of a Colour is to be the most beautiful._


/If/ A be the light, and B the object receiving it in a direct line,
E cannot receive that light, but only the reflexion from B, which we
shall suppose to be red.In that case, the light it produces being red,
it will tinge with red the object E; and if E happen to be also red
before, you will see that colour increase in beauty, and appear redder
than B; but if E were yellow, you will see a new colour, participating
of the red and the yellow.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCXXXVIII./--_That the Beauty of a Colour is to be found
in the Lights._


/As/ the quality of colours is discovered to the eye by the light, it
is natural to conclude, that where there is most light, there also
the true quality of the colour is to be seen; and where there is most
shadow the colour will participate of, and be tinged with the colour of
that shadow.Remember then to shew the true quality of the colour in
the light parts only[56].CCXXXIX./--_Of Colours._


/The/ colour which is between the light and the shadow will not be so
beautiful as that which is in the full light.Therefore the chief beauty
of colours will be found in the principal lights[57].CCXL./--_No Object appears in its true Colour, unless the
Light which strikes upon it be of the same Colour._


/This/ is very observable in draperies, where the light folds casting a
reflexion, and throwing a light on other folds opposite to them, make
them appear in their natural colour.The same effect is produced by gold
leaves casting their light reciprocally on each other.The effect is
quite contrary if the light be received from an object of a different
colour[58].CCXLI./--_Of the Colour of Shadows._


/The/ colour of the shadows of an object can never be pure if the body
which is opposed to these shadows be not of the same colour as that on
which they are produced.For instance, if in a room, the walls of which
are green, I place a figure clothed in blue, and receiving the light
from another blue object, the light part of that figure will be of a
beautiful blue, but the shadows of it will become dingy, and not like a
true shade of that beautiful blue, because it will be corrupted by the
reflexions from the green wall; and it would be still worse if the walls
were of a darkish brown.CCXLII./--_Of Colours._


/Colours/ placed in shadow will preserve more or less of their original
beauty, as they are more or less immersed in the shade.But colours
situated in a light space will shew their natural beauty in proportion
to the brightness of that light.Some say, that there is as great
variety in the colours of shadows, as in the colours of objects shaded
by them.It may be answered, that colours placed in shadow will shew
less variety amongst themselves as the shadows are darker.We shall
soon convince ourselves of this truth, if, from a large square, we look
through the open door of a church, where pictures, though enriched with
a variety of colours, appear all clothed in darkness.CCXLIII./--_Whether it be possible for all Colours to
appear alike by means of the same Shadow._


/It/ is very possible that all the different colours may be changed
into that of a general shadow; as is manifest in the darkness of a
cloudy night, in which neither the shape nor colour of bodies is
distinguished.Total darkness being nothing but a privation of the
primitive and reflected lights, by which the form and colour of bodies
are seen; it is evident, that the cause being removed the effect
ceases, and the objects are entirely lost to the sight.CCXLIV./--_Why White is not reckoned among the Colours._


/White/ is not a colour, but has the power of receiving all the other
colours.When it is placed in a high situation in the country, all its
shades are azure; according to the fourth proposition[59], which says,
that the surface of any opake body participates of the colour of any
other body sending the light to it.Therefore white being deprived of
the light of the sun by the interposition of any other body, will remain
white; if exposed to the sun on one side, and to the open air on the
other, it will participate both of the colour of the sun and of the air.That side which is not opposed to the sun, will be shaded of the colour
of the air.And if this white were not surrounded by green fields all
the way to the horizon, nor could receive any light from that horizon,
without doubt it would appear of one simple and uniform colour, viz.CCXLV./--_Of Colours._


/The/ light of the fire tinges every thing of a reddish yellow; but
this will hardly appear evident, if we do not make the comparison with
the daylight.Towards the close of the evening this is easily done; but
more certainly after the morning twilight; and the difference will be
clearly distinguished in a dark room, when a little glimpse of daylight
strikes upon any part of the room, and there still remains a candle
burning.Without such a trial the difference is hardly perceivable,
particularly in those colours which have most similarity; such as white
and yellow, light green and light blue; because the light which strikes
the blue, being yellow, will naturally turn it green; as we have said
in another place[60], that a mixture of blue and yellow produces green.And if to a green colour you add some yellow, it will make it of a more
beautiful green.CCXLVI./--_Of the Colouring of remote Objects._


/The/ painter, who is to represent objects at some distance from the
eye, ought merely to convey the idea of general undetermined masses,
making choice, for that purpose, of cloudy weather, or towards the
evening, and avoiding, as was said before, to mark the lights and
shadows too strong on the extremities; because they would in that
case appear like spots of difficult execution, and without grace.He
ought to remember, that the shadows are never to be of such a quality,
as to obliterate the proper colour, in which they originated; if the
situation of the <DW52> body be not in total darkness.He ought to
mark no outline, not to make the hair stringy, and not to touch with
pure white, any but those things which in themselves are white; in
short, the lightest touch upon any particular object ought to denote
the beauty of its proper and natural colour.CCXLVII./--_The Surface of all opake Bodies participates
of the Colour of the surrounding Objects._


/The/ painter ought to know, that if any white object is placed between
two walls, one of which is also white, and the other black, there will
be found between the shady side of that object and the light side, a
similar proportion to that of the two walls; and if that object be
blue, the effect will be the same.Having therefore to paint this
object, take some black, similar to that of the wall from which the
reflexes come; and to proceed by a certain and scientific method, do as
follows.When you paint the wall, take a small spoon to measure exactly
the quantity of colour you mean to employ in mixing your tints; for
instance, if you have put in the shading of this wall three spoonfuls
of pure black, and one of white, you have, without any doubt, a mixture
of a certain and precise quality.Now having painted one of the walls
white, and the other dark, if you mean to place a blue object between
them with shades suitable to that colour, place first on your pallet
the light blue, such as you mean it to be, without any mixture of
shade, and it will do for the lightest part of your object.After which
take three spoonfuls of black, and one of this light blue, for your
darkest shades.Then observe whether your object be round or square:
if it be square, these two extreme tints of light and shade will be
close to each other, cutting sharply at the angle; but if it be round,
draw lines from the extremities of the walls to the centre of the
object, and put the darkest shade between equal angles, where the lines
intersect upon the superficies of it; then begin to make them lighter
and lighter gradually to the point N O, lessening the strength of the
shadows as much as that place participates of the light A D, and mixing
that colour with the darkest shade A B, in the same proportion.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCXLVIII./--_General Remarks on Colours._


/Blue/ and green are not simple colours in their nature, for blue is
composed of light and darkness; such is the azure of the sky, viz.Green is composed of a simple and a
mixed colour, being produced by blue and yellow.Any object seen in a mirror, will participate of the colour of that
body which serves as a mirror; and the mirror in its turn is tinged in
part by the colour of the object it represents; they partake more or
less of each other as the colour of the object seen is more or less
strong than the colour of the mirror.That object will appear of the
strongest and most lively colour in the mirror, which has the most
affinity to the colour of the mirror itself.Of  bodies, the purest white will be seen at the greatest
distance, therefore the darker the colour, the less it will bear
distance.Of different bodies equal in whiteness, and in distance from the eye,
that which is surrounded by the greatest darkness will appear the
whitest; and on the contrary, that shadow will appear the darkest that
has the brightest white round it.Of different colours, equally perfect, that will appear most excellent,
which is seen near its direct contrary.A pale colour against red, a
black upon white (though neither the one nor the other are colours),
blue near a yellow; green near red; because each colour is more
distinctly seen, when opposed to its contrary, than to any other
similar to it.Any thing white seen in a dense air full of vapours, will appear larger
than it is in reality.The air, between the eye and the object seen, will change the colour
of that object into its own; so will the azure of the air change the
distant mountains into blue masses.Through a red glass every thing
appears red; the light round the stars is dimmed by the darkness of the
air, which fills the space between the eye and the planets.The true colour of any object whatever will be seen in those parts
which are not occupied by any kind of shade, and have not any gloss (if
it be a polished surface).I say, that white terminating abruptly upon a dark ground, will cause
that part where it terminates to appear darker, and the white whiter.COLOURS IN REGARD TO LIGHT AND SHADOW.CCXLIX./--_Of the Light proper for painting Flesh Colour from
Nature._


/Your/ window must be open to the sky, and the walls painted of a
reddish colour.The summertime is the best, when the clouds conceal the
sun, or else your walls on the south side of the room must be so high,
as that the sun-beams cannot strike on the opposite side, in order
that the reflexion of those beams may not destroy the shadows.CCL./--_Of the Painter's Window._


/The/ window which gives light to a painting-room, ought to be made of
oiled paper, without any cross bar, or projecting edge at the opening,
or any sharp angle in the inside of the wall, but should be slanting by
degrees the whole thickness of it; and the sides be painted black.CCLI./--_The Shadows of Colours._


/The/ shadows of any colour whatever must participate of that colour
more or less, as it is nearer to, or more remote from the mass of
shadows; and also in proportion to its distance from, or proximity to
the mass of light.CCLII./--_Of the Shadows of White._


/To/ any white body receiving the light from the sun, or the air, the
shadows should be of a blueish cast; because white is no colour, but a
receiver of all colours; and as by the fourth proposition[61] we learn,
that the surface of any object participates of the colours of other
objects near it, it is evident that a white surface will participate of
the colour of the air by which it is surrounded.CCLIII./--_Which of the Colours will produce the darkest Shade._


/That/ shade will be the darkest which is produced by the whitest
surface; this also will have a greater propensity to variety than any
other surface; because white is not properly a colour, but a receiver
of colours, and its surface will participate strongly of the colour of
surrounding objects, but principally of black or any other dark colour,
which being the most opposite to its nature, produces the most sensible
difference between the shadows and the lights.CCLIV./--_How to manage, when a White terminates upon another
White._


/When/ one white body terminates on another of the same colour, the
white of these two bodies will be either alike or not.If they be
alike, that object which of the two is nearest to the eye, should be
made a little darker than the other, upon the rounding of the outline;
but if the object which serves as a ground to the other be not quite so
white, the latter will detach of itself, without the help of any darker
termination.CCLV./--_On the Back-grounds of Figures._


/Of/ two objects equally light, one will appear less so if seen upon
a whiter ground; and, on the contrary, it will appear a great deal
lighter if upon a space of a darker shade.So flesh colour will appear
pale upon a red ground, and a pale colour will appear redder upon
a yellow ground.In short, colours will appear what they are not,
according to the ground which surrounds them.CCLVI./--_The Mode of composing History._


/Amongst/ the figures which compose an historical picture, those which
are meant to appear the nearest to the eye, must have the greatest
force; according to the second proposition[62] of the third book, which
says, that colour will be seen in the greatest perfection which has
less air interposed between it and the eye of the beholder; and for
that reason the shadows (by which we express the relievo of bodies)
appear darker when near than when at a distance, being then deadened by
the air which interposes.This does not happen to those shadows which
are near the eye, where they will produce the greatest relievo when
they are darkest.CCLVII./--_Remarks concerning Lights and Shadows._


/Observe/, that where the shadows end, there be always a kind of
half-shadow to blend them with the lights.The shadow derived from any
object will mix more with the light at its termination, in proportion
as it is more distant from that object.But the colour of the shadow
will never be simple: this is proved by the ninth proposition[63],
which says, that the superficies of any object participates of the
colours of other bodies, by which it is surrounded, although it were
transparent, such as water, air, and the like: because the air receives
its light from the sun, and darkness is produced by the privation of
it.But as the air has no colour in itself any more than water, it
receives all the colours that are between the object and the eye.The
vapours mixing with the air in the lower regions near the earth, render
it thick, and apt to reflect the sun's rays on all sides, while the air
above remains dark; and because light (that is, white) and darkness
(that is, black), mixed together, compose the azure that becomes the
colour of the sky, which is lighter or darker in proportion as the air
is more or less mixed with damp vapours.CCLVIII./--_Why the Shadows of Bodies upon a white Wall are
blueish towards Evening._


[Illustration]

/The/ shadows of bodies produced by the redness of the setting
sun, will always be blueish.This is accounted for by the eleventh
proposition[64], which says, that the superficies of any opake body
participates of the colour of the object from which it receives the
light; therefore the white wall being deprived entirely of colour, is
tinged by the colour of those bodies from which it receives the light,
which in this case are the sun and the sky.But because the sun is red
towards the evening, and the sky is blue, the shadow on the wall not
being enlightened by the sun, receives only the reflexion of the sky,
and therefore will appear blue; and the rest of the wall, receiving
light immediately from the sun, will participate of its red colour.CCLIX./--_Of the Colour of Faces._


/The/ colour of any object will appear more or less distinct in
proportion to the extent of its surface.This proportion is proved, by
observing that a face appears dark at a small distance, because, being
composed of many small parts, it produces a great number of shadows;
and the lights being the smallest part of it, are soonest lost to the
sight, leaving only the shadows, which being in a greater quantity, the
whole of the face appears dark, and the more so if that face has on the
head, or at the back, something whiter.CCLX./--_A Precept relating to Painting._


/Where/ the shadows terminate upon the lights, observe well what parts
of them are lighter than the others, and where they are more or less
softened and blended; but above all remember, that young people have
no sharp shadings: their flesh is transparent, something like what
we observe when we put our hand between the sun and eyes; it appears
reddish, and of a transparent brightness.If you wish to know what
kind of shadow will suit the flesh colour you are painting, place one
of your fingers close to your picture, so as to cast a shadow upon it,
and according as you wish it either lighter or darker, put it nearer or
farther from it, and imitate it.CCLXI./--_Of Colours in Shadow._


/It/ happens very often that the shadows of an opake body do not retain
the same colour as the lights.Sometimes they will be greenish, while
the lights are reddish, although this opake body be all over of one
uniform colour.This happens when the light falls upon the object (we
will suppose from the East), and tinges that side with its own colour.In the West we will suppose another opake body of a colour different
from the first, but receiving the same light.This last will reflect
its colour towards the East, and strike the first with its rays on the
opposite side, where they will be stopped, and remain with their full
colour and brightness.We often see a white object with red lights, and
the shades of a blueish cast; this we observe particularly in mountains
covered with snow, at sun-set, when the effulgence of its rays makes
the horizon appear all on fire.CCLXII./--_Of the Choice of Lights._


/Whatever/ object you intend to represent is to be supposed situated
in a particular light, and that entirely of your own choosing.If you
imagine such objects to be in the country, and the sun be overcast,
they will be surrounded by a great quantity of general light.If the
sun strikes upon those objects, then the shadows will be very dark,
in proportion to the lights, and will be determined and sharp; the
primitive as well as the secondary ones.These shadows will vary from
the lights in colour, because on that side the object receives a
reflected light hue from the azure of the air, which tinges that part;
and this is particularly observable in white objects.That side which
receives the light from the sun, participates also of the colour of
that.This may be particularly observed in the evening, when the sun
is setting between the clouds, which it reddens; those clouds being
tinged with the colour of the body illuminating them, the red colour
of the clouds, with that of the sun, casts a hue on those parts which
receive the light from them.On the contrary, those parts which are not
turned towards that side of the sky, remain of the colour of the air,
so that the former and the latter are of two different colours.This
we must not lose sight of, that, knowing the cause of those lights and
shades, it be made apparent in the effect, or else the work will be
false and absurd.But if a figure be situated within a house, and seen
from without, such figure will have its shadows very soft; and if the
beholder stands in the line of the light, it will acquire grace, and do
credit to the painter, as it will have great relief in the lights, and
soft and well-blended shadows, particularly in those parts where the
inside of the room appears less obscure, because there the shadows are
almost imperceptible: the cause of which we shall explain in its proper
place.COLOURS IN REGARD TO BACK-GROUNDS.CCLXIII./--_Of avoiding hard Outlines._


/Do/ not make the boundaries of your figures with any other colour
than that of the back-ground, on which they are placed; that is, avoid
making dark outlines.CCLXIV./--_Of Outlines._


/The/ extremities of objects which are at some distance, are not seen
so distinctly as if they were nearer.Therefore the painter ought to
regulate the strength of his outlines, or extremities, according to the
distance.The boundaries which separate one body from another, are of the nature
of mathematical lines, but not of real lines.The end of any colour
is only the beginning of another, and it ought not to be called a
line, for nothing interposes between them, except the termination of
the one against the other, which being nothing in itself, cannot be
perceivable; therefore the painter ought not to pronounce it in distant
objects.CCLXV./--_Of Back-grounds._


/One/ of the principal parts of painting is the nature and quality of
back-grounds, upon which the extremities of any convex or solid body
will always detach and be distinguished in nature, though the colour
of such objects, and that of the ground, be exactly the same.This
happens, because the convex sides of solid bodies do not receive the
light in the same manner with the ground, for such sides or extremities
are often lighter or darker than the ground.But if such extremities
were to be of the same colour as the ground, and in the same degree
of light, they certainly could not be distinguished.Therefore such a
choice in painting ought to be avoided by all intelligent and judicious
painters; since the intention is to make the objects appear as it were
out of the ground.The above case would produce the contrary effect,
not only in painting, but also in objects of real relievo.CCLXVI./--_How to detach Figures from the Ground._


/All/ solid bodies will appear to have a greater relief, and to come
more out of the canvass, on a ground of an undetermined colour, with
the greatest variety of lights and shades against the confines of
such bodies (as will be demonstrated in its place), provided a proper
diminution of lights in the white tints, and of darkness in the shades,
be judiciously observed.CCLXVII./--_Of Uniformity and Variety of Colours upon plain
Surfaces._


/The/ back-grounds of any flat surfaces which are uniform in colour and
quantity of light, will never appear separated from each other; _vice
versa_, they will appear separated if they are of different colours or
lights.CCLXVIII./--_Of Back-grounds suitable both to Shadows and
Lights._


/The/ shadows or lights which surround figures, or any other objects,
will help the more to detach them the more they differ from the
objects; that is, if a dark colour does not terminate upon another dark
colour, but upon a very different one; as white, or partaking of white,
but lowered, and approximated to the dark shade.CCLXIX./--_The apparent Variation of Colours, occasioned by the
Contraste of the Ground upon which they are placed._


/No/ colour appears uniform and equal in all its parts unless it
terminate on a ground of the same colour.This is very apparent when a
black terminates on a white ground, where the contraste of colour gives
more strength and richness to the extremities than to the middle.CONTRASTE, HARMONY, AND REFLEXES, IN REGARD TO COLOURS.CCLXX./--_Gradation in Painting._


/What/ is fine is not always beautiful and good: I address this to
such painters as are so attached to the beauty of colours, that they
regret being obliged to give them almost imperceptible shadows, not
considering the beautiful relief which figures acquire by a proper
gradation and strength of shadows.Such persons may be compared to
those speakers who in conversation make use of many fine words without
meaning, which altogether scarcely form one good sentence.CCLXXI./--_How to assort Colours in such a Manner as that they
may add Beauty to each other._


/If/ you mean that the proximity of one colour should give beauty to
another that terminates near it, observe the rays of the sun in the
composition of the rainbow, the colours of which are generated by the
falling rain, when each drop in its descent takes every colour of that
bow, as is demonstrated in its place[65].If you mean to represent great darkness, it must be done by contrasting
it with great light; on the contrary, if you want to produce great
brightness, you must oppose to it a very dark shade: so a pale yellow
will cause red to appear more beautiful than if opposed to a purple
colour.There is another rule, by observing which, though you do not increase
the natural beauty of the colours, yet by bringing them together they
may give additional grace to each other, as green placed near red,
while the effect would be quite the reverse, if placed near blue.Harmony and grace are also produced by a judicious arrangement of
colours, such as blue with pale yellow or white, and the like; as will
be noticed in its place.CCLXXII./--_Of detaching the Figures._


/Let/ the colours of which the draperies of your figures are composed,
be such as to form a pleasing variety, to distinguish one from the
other; and although, for the sake of harmony, they should be of the
same nature[66], they must not stick together, but vary in point of
light, according to the distance and interposition of the air between
them.By the same rule, the outlines are to be more precise, or lost,
in proportion to their distance or proximity.CCLXXIII./--_Of the Colour of Reflexes._


/All/ reflected colours are less brilliant and strong, than those which
receive a direct light, in the same proportion as there is between the
light of a body and the cause of that light.CCLXXIV./--_What Body will be the most strongly tinged with the
Colour of any other Object._


/An/ opake surface will partake most of the genuine colour of the body
nearest to it, because a great quantity of the species of colour will
be conveyed to it; whereas such colour would be broken and disturbed if
coming from a more distant object.CCLXXV./--_Of Reflexes._


/Reflexes/ will partake, more or less, both of the colour of the object
which produces them, and of the colour of that object on which they are
produced, in proportion as this latter body is of a smoother or more
polished surface, than that by which they are produced.CCLXXVI./--_Of the Surface of all shadowed Bodies._


/The/ surface of any opake body placed in shadow, will participate of
the colour of any other object which reflects the light upon it.This
is very evident; for if such bodies were deprived of light in the space
between them and the other bodies, they could not shew either shape or
colour.We shall conclude then, that if the opake body be yellow, and
that which reflects the light blue, the part reflected will be green,
because green is composed of blue and yellow.CCLXXVII./--_That no reflected Colour is simple, but is mixed
with the Nature of the other Colours._


/No/ colour reflected upon the surface of another body, will tinge that
surface with its own colour alone, but will be mixed by the concurrence
of other colours also reflected on the same spot.Let us suppose A to
be of a yellow colour, which is reflected on the convex C O E, and that
the blue colour B be reflected on the same place.I say that a mixture
of the blue and yellow colours will tinge the convex surface; and that,
if the ground be white, it will produce a green reflexion, because it
is proved that a mixture of blue and yellow produces a very fine green.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCLXXVIII./--_Of the Colour of Lights and Reflexes._


/When/ two lights strike upon an opake body, they can vary only in
two ways; either they are equal in strength, or they are not.If
they be equal, they may still vary in two other ways, that is, by
the equality or inequality of their brightness; they will be equal,
if their distance be the same; and unequal, if it be otherwise.The
object placed at an equal distance, between two equal lights, in point
both of colour and brightness, may still be enlightened by them in two
different ways, either equally on each side, or unequally.It will be
equally enlightened by them, when the space which remains round the
lights shall be equal in colour, in degree of shade, and in brightness.It will be unequally enlightened by them when the spaces happen to be
of different degrees of darkness.CCLXXIX./--_Why reflected Colours seldom partake of the Colour
of the Body where they meet._


/It/ happens very seldom that the reflexes are of the same colour with
the body from which they proceed, or with that upon which they meet.To exemplify this, let the convex body D F G E be of a yellow colour,
and the body B C, which reflects its colour on it, blue; the part of
the convex surface which is struck by that reflected light, will take
a green tinge, being B C, acted on by the natural light of the air, or
the sun.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCLXXX./--_The Reflexes of Flesh Colours._


/The/ lights upon the flesh colours, which are reflected by the light
striking upon another flesh-<DW52> body, are redder and more lively
than any other part of the human figure; and that happens according
to the third proposition of the second book[67], which says, the
surface of any opake body participates of the colour of the object
which reflects the light, in proportion as it is near to or remote
from it, and also in proportion to the size of it; because, being
large, it prevents the variety of colours in smaller objects round it,
from interfering with, and discomposing the principal colour, which
is nearer.Nevertheless it does not prevent its participating more of
the colour of a small object near it, than of a large one more remote.See the sixth proposition[68] of perspective, which says, that large
objects may be situated at such a distance as to appear less than small
ones that are near.CCLXXXI./--_Of the Nature of Comparison._


/Black/ draperies will make the flesh of the human figure appear whiter
than in reality it is[69]; and white draperies, on the contrary, will
make it appear darker.Yellow will render it higher, while red
will make it pale.CCLXXXII./--_Where the Reflexes are seen._


/Of/ all reflexions of the same shape, size, and strength, that will be
more or less strong, which terminates on a ground more or less dark.The surface of those bodies will partake most of the colour of the
object that reflects it, which receive that reflexion by the most
nearly equal angles.Of the colours of objects reflected upon any opposite surface by equal
angles, that will be the most distinct which has its reflecting ray the
shortest.Of all colours, reflected under equal angles, and at equal distance
upon the opposite body, those will be the strongest, which come
reflected by the lightest <DW52> body.That object will reflect its own colour most precisely on the opposite
object, which has not round it any colour that clashes with its own;
and consequently that reflected colour will be most confused which
takes its origin from a variety of bodies of different colours.That colour which is nearest the opposed object, will tinge it the most
strongly; and _vice versa_: let the painter, therefore, in his reflexes
on the human body, particularly on the flesh colour, mix some of the
colour of the drapery which comes nearest to it; but not pronounce it
too distinctly, if there be not good reason for it.CCLXXXIII./--_A Precept of Perspective in regard to Painting._


/When/, on account of some particular quality of the air, you can no
longer distinguish the difference between the lights and shadows of
objects, you may reject the perspective of shadows, and make use only
of the linear perspective, and the diminution of colours, to lessen the
knowledge of the objects opposed to the eye; and this, that is to say,
the loss of the knowledge of the figure of each object, will make the
same object appear more remote.The eye can never arrive at a perfect knowledge of the interval between
two objects variously distant, by means of the linear perspective
alone, if not assisted by the perspective of colours.CCLXXXIV./--_Of the Perspective of Colours._


/The/ air will participate less of the azure of the sky, in proportion
as it comes nearer to the horizon, as it is proved by the third and
ninth proposition[70], that pure and subtile bodies (such as compose
the air) will be less illuminated by the sun than those of thicker and
grosser substance: and as it is certain that the air which is remote
from the earth, is thinner than that which is near it, it will follow,
that the latter will be more impregnated with the rays of the sun,
which giving light at the same time to an infinity of atoms floating
in this air, renders it more sensible to the eye.So that the air will
appear lighter towards the horizon, and darker as well as bluer in
looking up to the sky; because there is more of the thick air between
our eyes and the horizon, than between our eyes and that part of the
sky above our heads.[Illustration]

For instance: if the eye placed in P, looks through the air along the
line P R, and then lowers itself a little along P S, the air will begin
to appear a little whiter, because there is more of the thick air in
this space than in the first.And if it be still removed lower, so
as to look straight at the horizon, no more of that blue sky will be
perceived which was observable along the first line P R, because there
is a much greater quantity of thick air along the horizontal line P D,
than along the oblique P S, or the perpendicular P R.CCLXXXV./--_The Cause of the Diminution of Colours._


/The/ natural colour of any visible object will be diminished in
proportion to the density of any other substance which interposes
between that object and the eye.CCLXXXVI./--_Of the Diminution of Colours and Objects._


/Let/ the colours vanish in proportion as the objects diminish in size,
according to the distance.CCLXXXVII./--_Of the Variety observable in Colours, according to
their Distance, or Proximity._


/The/ local colour of such objects as are darker than the air, will
appear less dark as they are more remote; and, on the contrary, objects
lighter than the air will lose their brightness in proportion to their
distance from the eye.In general, all objects that are darker or
lighter than the air, are discoloured by distance, which changes their
quality, so that the lighter appears darker, and the darker lighter.CCLXXXVIII./--_At what Distance Colours are entirely lost._


/Local/ colours are entirely lost at a greater or less distance,
according as the eye and the object are more or less elevated from the
earth.This is proved by the seventh proposition[71], which says, the
air is more or less pure, as it is near to, or remote from the earth.If the eye then, and the object are near the earth, the thickness of
the air which interposes, will in a great measure confuse the colour of
that object to the eye.But if the eye and the object are placed high
above the earth, the air will disturb the natural colour of that object
very little.In short, the various gradations of colour depend not only
on the various distances, in which they may be lost; but also on the
variety of lights, which change according to the different hours of the
day, and the thickness or purity of the air, through which the colour
of the object is conveyed to the eye.CCLXXXIX./--_Of the Change observable in the same Colour,
according to its Distance from the Eye._


/Among/ several colours of the same nature, that which is the nearest
to the eye will alter the least; because the air which interposes
between the eye and the object seen, envelopes, in some measure, that
object.If the air, which interposes, be in great quantity, the object
seen will be strongly tinged with the colour of that air; but if the
air be thin, then the view of that object, and its colour, will be very
little obstructed.CCXC./--_Of the blueish Appearance of remote Objects in a
Landscape._


/Whatever/ be the colour of distant objects, the darkest, whether
natural or accidental, will appear the most tinged with azure.By
the natural darkness is meant the proper colour of the object; the
accidental one is produced by the shadow of some other body.CCXCI./--_Of the Qualities in the Surface which first lose
themselves by Distance._


/The/ first part of any colour which is lost by the distance, is the
gloss, being the smallest part of it, as a light within a light.The
second that diminishes by being farther removed, is the light, because
it is less in quantity than the shadow.The third is the principal
shadows, nothing remaining at last but a kind of middling obscurity.CCXCII./--_From what Cause the Azure of the Air proceeds._


/The/ azure of the sky is produced by the transparent body of the
air, illumined by the sun, and interposed between the darkness of the
expanse above, and the earth below.The air in itself has no quality
of smell, taste, or colour, but is easily impregnated with the quality
of other matter surrounding it; and will appear bluer in proportion to
the darkness of the space behind it, as may be observed against the
shady sides of mountains, which are darker than any other object.In
this instance the air appears of the most beautiful azure, while on the
other side that receives the light, it shews through that more of the
natural colour of the mountain.CCXCIII./--_Of the Perspective of Colours._


/The/ same colour being placed at various distances and equal
elevation, the force and effect of its colouring will be according
to the proportion of the distance which there is from each of these
colours to the eye.It is proved thus: let C B E D be one and the same
colour.The first, E, is placed at two degrees of distance from the eye
A; the second, B, shall be four degrees, the third, C, six degrees,
and the fourth, D, eight degrees; as appears by the circles which
terminate upon and intersect the line A R. Let us suppose that the
space A R, S P, is one degree of thin air, and S P E T another degree
of thicker air.It will follow, that the first colour, E, will pass
to the eye through one degree of thick air, E S, and through another
degree, S A, of thinner air.And B will send its colour to the eye in
A, through two degrees of thick air, and through two others of the
thinner sort.C will send it through three degrees of the thin, and
three of the thick sort, while D goes through four degrees of the one,
and four of the other.This demonstrates, that the gradation of colours
is in proportion to their distance from the eye[72].But this happens
only to those colours which are on a level with the eye; as for those
which happen to be at unequal elevations, we cannot observe the same
rule, because they are in that case situated in different qualities of
air, which alter and diminish these colours in various manners.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCXCIV./--_Of the Perspective of Colours in dark Places._


/In/ any place where the light diminishes in a gradual proportion till
it terminates in total darkness, the colours also will lose themselves
and be dissolved in proportion as they recede from the eye.CCXCV./--_Of the Perspective of Colours._


/The/ principal colours, or those nearest to the eye, should be pure
and simple; and the degree of their diminution should be in proportion
to their distance, viz.the nearer they are to the principal point, the
more they will possess of the purity of those colours, and they will
partake of the colour of the horizon in proportion as they approach to
it.CCXCVI./--_Of Colours._


/Of/ all the colours which are not blue, those that are nearest to
black will, when distant, partake most of the azure; and, on the
contrary, those will preserve their proper colour at the greatest
distance, that are most dissimilar to black.The green therefore of the fields will change sooner into blue than
yellow, or white, which will preserve their natural colour at a greater
distance than that, or even red.CCXCVII./--_How it happens that Colours do not change, though
placed in different Qualities of Air._


/The/ colour will not be subject to any alteration when the distance
and the quality of air have a reciprocal proportion.What it loses by
the distance it regains by the purity of the air, viz.if we suppose
the first or lowest air to have four degrees of thickness, and the
colour to be at one degree from the eye, and the second air above to
have three degrees.The air having lost one degree of thickness, the
colour will acquire one degree upon the distance.And when the air
still higher shall have lost two degrees of thickness, the colour will
acquire as many upon the distance; and in that case the colour will be
the same at three degrees as at one.But to be brief, if the colour be
raised so high as to enter that quality of air which has lost three
degrees of thickness, and acquired three degrees of distance, then you
may be certain that that colour which is high and remote, has lost
no more than the colour which is below and nearer; because in rising
it has acquired those three degrees which it was losing by the same
distance from the eye; and this is what was meant to be proved.CCXCVIII./--_Why Colours experience no apparent Change, though
placed in different Qualities of Air._


[Illustration]

/It/ may happen that a colour does not alter, though placed at
different distances, when the thickness of the air and the distance
are in the same inverse proportion.It is proved thus: let A be the
eye, and H any colour whatever, placed at one degree of distance
from the eye, in a quality of air of four degrees of thickness; but
because the second degree above, A M N L, contains a thinner air by
one half, which air conveys this colour, it follows that this colour
will appear as if removed double the distance it was at before, viz.at two degrees of distance, A F and F G, from the eye; and it will be
placed in G. If that is raised to the second degree of air A M N L, and
to the degree O M, P N, it will necessarily be placed at E, and will
be removed from the eye the whole length of the line A E, which will
be proved in this manner to be equal in thickness to the distance A G.
If in the same quality of air the distance A G interposed between the
eye and the colour occupies two degrees, and A E occupies two degrees
and a half, it is sufficient to preserve the colour G, when raised to
E, from any change, because the degree A C and the degree A F being
the same in thickness, are equal and alike, and the degree C D, though
equal in length to the degree F G, is not alike in point of thickness
of air; because half of it is situated in a degree of air of double the
thickness of the air above: this half degree of distance occupies as
much of the colour as one whole degree of the air above would, which
air above is twice as thin as the air below, with which it terminates;
so that by calculating the thickness of the air, and the distances,
you will find that the colours have changed places without undergoing
any alteration in their beauty.And we shall prove it thus: reckoning
first the thickness of air, the colour H is placed in four degrees of
thickness, the colour G in two degrees, and E at one degree.Now let
us see whether the distances are in an equal inverse proportion; the
colour E is at two degrees and a half of distance, G at two degrees,
and H at one degree.But as this distance has not an exact proportion
with the thickness of air, it is necessary to make a third calculation
in this manner: A C is perfectly like and equal to A F; the half
degree, C B, is like but not equal to A F, because it is only half a
degree in length, which is equal to a whole degree of the quality of
the air above; so that by this calculation we shall solve the question.For A C is equal to two degrees of thickness of the air above, and the
half degree C B is equal to a whole degree of the same air above; and
one degree more is to be taken in, viz.A H has four degrees of thickness of air, A G also four, viz.A F two
in value, and F G also two, which taken together make four.A E has
also four, because A C contains two, and C D one, which is the half
of A C, and in the same quality of air; and there is a whole degree
above in the thin air, which all together make four.So that if A E is
not double the distance A G, nor four times the distance A H, it is
made equivalent by the half degree C B of thick air, which is equal
to a whole degree of thin air above.This proves the truth of the
proposition, that the colour H G E does not undergo any alteration by
these different distances.CCXCIX./--_Contrary Opinions in regard to Objects seen afar off._


/Many/ painters will represent the objects darker, in proportion as
they are removed from the eye; but this cannot be true, unless the
objects seen be white; as shall be examined in the next chapter.CCC./--_Of the Colour of Objects remote from the Eye._


/The/ air tinges objects with its own colour more or less in proportion
to the quantity of intervening air between it and the eye, so that a
dark object at the distance of two miles (or a density of air equal to
such distance), will be more tinged with its colour than if only one
mile distant.It is said, that, in a landscape, trees of the same species appear
darker in the distance than near; this cannot be true, if they be of
equal size, and divided by equal spaces.But it will be so if the
first trees are scattered, and the light of the fields is seen through
and between them, while the others which are farther off, are thick
together, as is often the case near some river or other piece of water:
in this case no space of light fields can be perceived, but the trees
appear thick together, accumulating the shadow on each other.It also
happens, that as the shady parts of plants are much broader than the
light ones, the colour of the plants becoming darker by the multiplied
shadows, is preserved, and conveyed to the eye more strongly than that
of the other parts; these masses, therefore, will carry the strongest
parts of their colour to a greater distance.CCCI./--_Of the Colour of Mountains._


/The/ darker the mountain is in itself, the bluer it will appear at a
great distance.The highest part will be the darkest, as being more
woody; because woods cover a great many shrubs, and other plants,
which never receive any light.The wild plants of those woods are also
naturally of a darker hue than cultivated plants; for oak, beech, fir,
cypress, and pine trees are much darker than olive and other domestic
plants.Near the top of these mountains, where the air is thinner and
purer, the darkness of the woods will make it appear of a deeper azure,
than at the bottom, where the air is thicker.A plant will detach very
little from the ground it stands upon, if that ground be of a colour
something similar to its own; and, _vice versa_, that part of any white
object which is nearest to a dark one, will appear the whitest, and
the less so as it is removed from it; and any dark object will appear
darker, the nearer it is to a white one; and less so, if removed from
it.CCCII./--_Why the Colour and Shape of Objects are lost in some
Situations apparently dark, though not so in Reality._


/There/ are some situations which, though light, appear dark, and in
which objects are deprived both of form and colour.This is caused by
the great light which pervades the intervening air; as is observable by
looking in through a window at some distance from the eye, when nothing
is seen but an uniform darkish shade; but if we enter the house, we
shall find that room to be full of light, and soon distinguish every
small object contained within that window.This difference of effect
is produced by the great brightness of the air, which contracts
considerably the pupil of the eye, and by so doing diminishes its
power.But in dark places the pupil is enlarged, and acquires as much
in strength, as it increases in size.This is proved in my second
proposition of perspective[73].CCCIII./--_Various Precepts in Painting._


/The/ termination and shape of the parts in general are very little
seen, either in great masses of light, or of shadows; but those which
are situated between the extremes of light and shade are the most
distinct.Perspective, as far as it extends in regard to painting, is divided
into three principal parts; the first consists in the diminution of
size, according to distance; the second concerns the diminution of
colours in such objects; and the third treats of the diminution of the
perception altogether of those objects, and of the degree of precision
they ought to exhibit at various distances.The azure of the sky is produced by a mixture composed of light and
darkness[74]; I say of light, because of the moist particles floating
in the air, which reflect the light.By darkness, I mean the pure air,
which has none of these extraneous particles to stop and reflect the
rays.Of this we see an example in the air interposed between the eye
and some dark mountains, rendered so by the shadows of an innumerable
quantity of trees; or else shaded on one side by the natural privation
of the rays of the sun; this air becomes azure, but not so on the side
of the mountain which is light, particularly when it is covered with
snow.Among objects of equal darkness and equal distance, those will appear
darker that terminate upon a lighter ground, and _vice versa_[75].That object which is painted with the most white and the most black,
will shew greater relief than any other; for that reason I would
recommend to painters to colour and dress their figures with the
brightest and most lively colours; for if they are painted of a dull
or obscure colour, they will detach but little, and not be much seen,
when the picture is placed at some distance; because the colour of
every object is obscured in the shades; and if it be represented as
originally so all over, there will be but little difference between
the lights and the shades, while lively colours will shew a striking
difference.CCCIV./--_Aerial Perspective._


/There/ is another kind of perspective called aerial, because by the
difference of the air it is easy to determine the distance of different
objects, though seen on the same line; such, for instance, as buildings
behind a wall, and appearing all of the same height above it.If in
your picture you want to have one appear more distant than another, you
must first suppose the air somewhat thick, because, as we have said
before, in such a kind of air the objects seen at a great distance,
as mountains are, appear blueish like the air, by means of the great
quantity of air that interposes between the eye and such mountains.You will then paint the first building behind that wall of its proper
colour; the next in point of distance, less distinct in the outline,
and participating, in a greater degree, of the blueish colour of the
air; another which you wish to send off as much farther, should be
painted as much bluer; and if you wish one of them to appear five times
farther removed beyond the wall, it must have five times more of the
azure.By this rule these buildings which appeared all of the same
size, and upon the same line, will be distinctly perceived to be of
different dimensions, and at different distances.CCCV./--_The Parts of the Smallest Objects will first disappear
in Painting._


/Of/ objects receding from the eye the smallest will be the first lost
to the sight; from which it follows, that the largest will be the last
to disappear.The painter, therefore, ought not to finish the parts of
those objects which are very far off, but follow the rule given in the
sixth book[76].How many, in the representation of towns, and other objects remote
from the eye, express every part of the buildings in the same manner
as if they were very near.It is not so in nature, because there is no
sight so powerful as to perceive distinctly at any great distance the
precise form of parts or extremities of objects.The painter therefore
who pronounces the outlines, and the minute distinction of parts, as
several have done, will not give the representation of distant objects,
but by this error will make them appear exceedingly near.Again, the
angles of buildings in distant towns are not to be expressed (for they
cannot be seen), considering that angles are formed by the concurrence
of two lines into one point, and that a point has no parts; it is
therefore invisible.CCCVI./--_Small Figures ought not to be too much finished._


/Objects/ appear smaller than they really are when they are distant
from the eye, and because there is a great deal of air interposed,
which weakens the appearance of forms, and, by a natural consequence,
prevents our seeing distinctly the minute parts of such objects.It
behoves the painter therefore to touch those parts slightly, in an
unfinished manner; otherwise it would be against the effect of Nature,
whom he has chosen for his guide.For, as we said before, objects
appear small on account of their great distance from the eye; that
distance includes a great quantity of air, which, forming a dense body,
obstructs the light, and prevents our seeing the minute parts of the
objects.CCCVII./--_Why the Air is to appear whiter as it approaches
nearer to the Earth._


/As/ the air is thicker nearer the earth, and becomes thinner as it
rises, look, when the sun is in the east, towards the west, between the
north and south, and you will perceive that the thickest and lowest air
will receive more light from the sun than the thinner air, because its
beams meet with more resistance.If the sky terminate low, at the end of a plain, that part of it
nearest to the horizon, being seen only through the thick air, will
alter and break its natural colour, and will appear whiter than over
your head, where the visual ray does not pass through so much of that
gross air, corrupted by earthy vapours.But if you turn towards the
east, the air will be darker the nearer it approaches the earth; for
the air being thicker, does not admit the light of the sun to pass so
freely.CCCVIII./--_How to paint the distant Part of a Landscape._


/It/ is evident that the air is in some parts thicker and grosser than
in others, particularly that nearest to the earth; and as it rises
higher, it becomes thinner and more transparent.The objects which
are high and large, from which you are at some distance, will be less
apparent in the lower parts; because the visual ray which perceives
them, passes through a long space of dense air; and it is easy to prove
that the upper parts are seen by a line, which, though on the side of
the eye it originates in a thick air, nevertheless, as it ascends to
the highest summit of its object, terminates in an air much thinner
than that of the lower parts; and for that reason the more that line
or visual ray advances from the eye, it becomes, in its progress
from one point to another, thinner and thinner, passing from a pure
air into another which is purer; so that a painter who has mountains
to represent in a landscape, ought to observe, that from one hill
to another, the tops will appear always clearer than the bases.In
proportion as the distance from one to another is greater, the top will
be clearer; and the higher they are, the more they will shew their
variety of form and colour.CCCIX./--_Of precise and confused Objects._


/The/ parts that are near in the fore-ground should be finished in a
bold determined manner; but those in the distance must be unfinished,
and confused in their outlines.CCCX./--_Of distant Objects._


/That/ part of any object which is nearest to the luminary from which
it receives the light, will be the lightest.The representation of an object in every degree of distance, loses
degrees of its strength; that is, in proportion as the object is more
remote from the eye it will be less perceivable through the air in its
representation.CCCXI./--_Of Buildings seen in a thick Air._


[Illustration]

/That/ part of a building seen through a thick air, will appear less
distinct than another part seen through a thinner air.Therefore the
eye, N, looking at the tower A D, will see it more confusedly in the
lower degrees, but at the same time lighter; and as it ascends to the
other degrees it will appear more distinct, but somewhat darker.CCCXII./--_Of Towns and other Objects seen through a thick Air._


[Illustration]

/Buildings/ or towns seen through a fog, or the air made thick by
smoke or other vapours, will appear less distinct the lower they
are; and, _vice versa_, they will be sharper and more visible in
proportion as they are higher.We have said, in Chapter cccxxi.that
the air is thicker the lower it is, and thinner as it is higher.It is
demonstrated also by the cut, where the tower, A F, is seen by the eye
N, in a thick air, from B to F, which is divided into four degrees,
growing thicker as they are nearer the bottom.The less the quantity of
air interposed between the eye and its object is, the less also will
the colour of the object participate of the colour of that air.It
follows, that the greater the quantity of the air interposed between
the eye and the object seen, is, the more this object will participate
of the colour of the air.It is demonstrated thus: N being the eye
looking at the five parts of the tower A F, viz.A B C D E, I say,
that if the air were of the same thickness, there would be the same
proportion between the colour of the air at the bottom of the tower and
the colour of the air that the same tower has at the place B, as there
is in length between the line M and F. As, however, we have supposed
that the air is not of equal thickness, but, on the contrary, thicker
as it is lower, it follows, that the proportion by which the air tinges
the different elevations of the tower B C F, exceeds the proportion
of the lines; because the line M F, besides its being longer than the
line S B, passes by unequal degrees through a quality of air which is
unequal in thickness.CCCXIII./--_Of the inferior Extremities of distant Objects._


/The/ inferior or lower extremities of distant objects are not so
apparent as the upper extremities.This is observable in mountains
and hills, the tops of which detach from the sides of other mountains
behind.We see the tops of these more determined and distinctly than
their bases; because the upper extremities are darker, being less
encompassed by thick air, which always remains in the lower regions,
and makes them appear dim and confused.It is the same with trees,
buildings, and other objects high up.From this effect it often happens
that a high tower, seen at a great distance, will appear broad at top,
and narrow at bottom; because the thin air towards the top does not
prevent the angles on the sides and other different parts of the tower
from being seen, as the thick air does at bottom.This is demonstrated
by the seventh proposition[77], which says, that the thick air
interposed between the eye and the sun, is lighter below than above,
and where the air is whiteish, it confuses the dark objects more than if
such air were blueish or thinner, as it is higher up.The battlements
of a fortress have the spaces between equal to the breadth of the
battlement, and yet the space will appear wider; at a great distance
the battlements will appear very much diminished, and being removed
still farther, will disappear entirely, and the fort shew only the
straight wall, as if there were no battlements.CCCXIV./--_Which Parts of Objects disappear first by being
removed farther from the Eye, and which preserve their Appearance._


/The/ smallest parts are those which, by being removed, lose their
appearance first; this may be observed in the gloss upon spherical
bodies, or columns, and the slender parts of animals; as in a stag,
the first sight of which does not discover its legs and horns so soon
as its body, which, being broader, will be perceived from a greater
distance.But the parts which disappear the very first, are the lines
which describe the members, and terminate the surface and shape of
bodies.CCCXV./--_Why Objects are less distinguished in proportion as
they are farther removed from the Eye._


/This/ happens because the smallest parts are lost first; the second,
in point of size, are also lost at a somewhat greater distance, and so
on successively; the parts by degrees melting away, the perception of
the object is diminished; and at last all the parts, and the whole, are
entirely lost to the sight[78].Colours also disappear on account of
the density of the air interposed between the eye and the object.CCCXVI./--_Why Faces appear dark at a Distance._


/It/ is evident that the similitude of all objects placed before us,
large as well as small, is perceptible to our senses through the iris
of the eye.If through so small an entrance the immensity of the sky
and of the earth is admitted, the faces of men (which are scarcely any
thing in comparison of such large objects), being still diminished by
the distance, will occupy so little of the eye, that they become almost
imperceptible.Besides, having to pass through a dark medium from the
surface to the _Retina_ in the inside, where the impression is made,
the colour of faces (not being very strong, and rendered still more
obscure by the darkness of the tube) when arrived at the focus appears
dark.No other reason can be given on that point, except that the speck
in the middle of the apple of the eye is black, and, being full of a
transparent fluid like air, performs the same office as a hole in a
board, which on looking into it appears black; and that those things
which are seen through both a light and dark air, become confused and
obscure.CCCXVII./--_Of Towns and other Buildings seen through a Fog in
the Morning or Evening._


/Buildings/ seen afar off in the morning or in the evening, when there
is a fog, or thick air, shew only those parts distinctly which are
enlightened by the sun towards the horizon; and the parts of those
buildings which are not turned towards the sun remain confused and
almost of the colour of the fog.CCCXVIII./--_Of the Height of Buildings seen in a Fog._


/Of/ a building near the eye the top parts will appear more confused
than the bottom, because there is more fog between the eye and the top
than at the base.And a square tower, seen at a great distance through
a fog, will appear narrower at the base than at the summit.This is
accounted for in Chapter cccxiii.which says, that the fog will appear
whiter and thicker as it approaches the ground; and as it is said
before[79], that a dark object will appear smaller in proportion as it
is placed on a whiter ground.Therefore the fog being whiter at bottom
than at top, it follows that the tower (being darkish) will appear
narrower at the base than at the summit.CCCXIX./--_Why Objects which are high, appear darker at a
Distance than those which are low, though the Fog be uniform, and of
equal Thickness._


/Amongst/ objects situated in a fog, thick air, vapour, smoke, or at
a distance, the highest will be the most distinctly seen: and amongst
objects equal in height, that placed in the darkest fog, will be most
confused and dark.As it happens to the eye H, looking at A B C, three
towers of equal height; it sees the top C as low as R, in two degrees
of thickness; and the top B, in one degree only; therefore the top C
will appear darker than the top of the tower B.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXX./--_Of Objects seen in a Fog._


/Objects/ seen through a fog will appear larger than they are in
reality, because the aerial perspective does not agree with the linear,
viz.the colour does not agree with the magnitude of the object[80];
such a fog being similar to the thickness of air interposed between the
eye and the horizon in fine weather.But in this case the fog is near
the eye, and though the object be also near, it makes it appear as if
it were as far off as the horizon; where a great tower would appear no
bigger than a man placed near the eye.CCCXXI./--_Of those Objects which the Eyes perceive through a
Mist or thick Air._


/The/ nearer the air is to water, or to the ground, the thicker it
becomes.It is proved by the nineteenth proposition of the second
book[81], that bodies rise in proportion to their weight; and it
follows, that a light body will rise higher than another which is heavy.CCCXXII./--_Miscellaneous Observations._


/Of/ different objects equal in magnitude, form, shade, and distance
from the eye, those will appear the smaller that are placed on the
lighter ground.This is exemplified by observing the sun when seen
behind a tree without leaves; all the ramifications seen against that
great light are so diminished that they remain almost invisible.The
same may be observed of a pole placed between the sun and the eye.Parallel bodies placed upright, and seen through a fog, will
appear larger at top than at bottom.This is proved by the ninth
proposition[82], which says, that a fog, or thick air, penetrated by
the rays of the sun, will appear whiter the lower they are.Things seen afar off will appear out of proportion, because the parts
which are the lightest will send their image with stronger rays than
the parts which are darkest.I have seen a woman dressed in black,
with a white veil over her head, which appeared twice as large as her
shoulders covered with black.MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.CCCXXIII./--_Of Objects seen at a Distance._


/Any/ dark object will appear lighter when removed to some distance
from the eye.It follows, by the contrary reason, that a dark object
will appear still darker when brought nearer to the eye.Therefore the
inferior parts of any object whatever, placed in thick air, will appear
farther from the eye at the bottom than at the top; for that reason the
lower parts of a mountain appear farther off than its top, which is in
reality the farthest.CCCXXIV./--_Of a Town seen through a thick Air._


/The/ eye which, looking downwards, sees a town immersed in very thick
air, will perceive the top of the buildings darker, but more distinct
than the bottom.The tops detach against a light ground, because they
are seen against the low and thick air which is beyond them.This is a
consequence of what has been explained in the preceding chapter.CCCXXV./--_How to draw a Landscape._


/Contrive/ that the trees in your landscape be half in shadow and half
in the light.It is better to represent them as when the sun is veiled
with thin clouds, because in that case the trees receive a general
light from the sky, and are darkest in those parts which are nearest to
the earth.CCCXXVI./--_Of the Green of the Country._


/Of/ the greens seen in the country, that of trees and other plants
will appear darker than that of fields and meadows, though they may
happen to be of the same quality.CCCXXVII./--_What Greens will appear most of a blueish Cast._


/Those/ greens will appear to approach nearest to blue which are
of the darkest shade when remote.This is proved by the seventh
proposition[83], which says, that blue is composed of black and white
seen at a great distance.CCCXXVIII./--_The Colour of the Sea from different Aspects._


/When/ the sea is a little ruffled it has no sameness of colour; for
whoever looks at it from the shore, will see it of a dark colour, in a
greater degree as it approaches towards the horizon, and will perceive
also certain lights moving slowly on the surface like a flock of sheep.Whoever looks at the sea from on board a ship, at a distance from the
land, sees it blue.Near the shore it appears darkish, on account of
the colour of the earth reflected by the water, as in a looking-glass;
but at sea the azure of the air is reflected to the eye by the waves in
the same manner.CCCXXIX./--_Why the same Prospect appears larger at some Times
than at others._


/Objects/ in the country appear sometimes larger and sometimes smaller
than they actually are, from the circumstance of the air interposed
between the eye and the horizon, happening to be either thicker or
thinner than usual.Of two horizons equally distant from the eye, that which is seen
through the thicker air will appear farther removed; and the other will
seem nearer, being seen through a thinner air.Objects of unequal size, but equally distant, will appear equal if the
air which is between them and the eye be of proportionable inequality
of thickness, viz.if the thickest air be interposed between the eye
and the smallest of the objects.This is proved by the perspective of
colours[84], which is so deceitful that a mountain which would appear
small by the compasses, will seem larger than a small hill near the
eye; as a finger placed near the eye will cover a large mountain far
off.CCCXXX./--_Of Smoke._


/Smoke/ is more transparent, though darker towards the extremities of
its waves than in the middle.It moves in a more oblique direction in proportion to the force of the
wind which impels it.Different kinds of smoke vary in colour, as the causes that produce
them are various.Smoke never produces determined shadows, and the extremities are lost
as they recede from their primary cause.Objects behind it are less
apparent in proportion to the thickness of the smoke.It is whiter
nearer its origin, and bluer towards its termination.Fire appears darker, the more smoke there is interposed between it and
the eye.Where smoke is farther distant, the objects are less confused by it.It encumbers and dims all the landscape like a fog.Smoke is seen to
issue from different places, with flames at the origin, and the most
dense part of it.The tops of mountains will be more seen than the
lower parts, as in a fog.CCCXXXI./--_In what Part Smoke is lightest._


/Smoke/ which is seen between the sun and the eye will be lighter and
more transparent than any other in the landscape.The same is observed
of dust, and of fog; while, if you place yourself between the sun and
those objects, they will appear dark.CCCXXXII./--_Of the Sun-beams passing through the Openings of
Clouds._


/The/ sun-beams which penetrate the openings interposed between clouds
of various density and form, illuminate all the places over which they
pass, and tinge with their own colour all the dark places that are
behind: which dark places are only seen in the intervals between the
rays.CCCXXXIII./--_Of the Beginning of Rain._


/When/ the rain begins to fall, it tarnishes and darkens the air,
giving it a dull colour, but receives still on one side a faint light
from the sun, and is shaded on the other side, as we observe in clouds;
till at last it darkens also the earth, depriving it entirely of the
light of the sun.Objects seen through the rain appear confused and of
undetermined shape, but those which are near will be more distinct.It
is observable, that on the side where the rain is shaded, objects will
be more clearly distinguished than where it receives the light; because
on the shady side they lose only their principal lights, whilst on
the other they lose both their lights and shadows, the lights mixing
with the light part of the rain, and the shadows are also considerably
weakened by it.CCCXXXIV./--_The Seasons are to be observed._


/In/ Autumn you will represent the objects according as it is more or
less advanced.At the beginning of it the leaves of the oldest branches
only begin to fade, more or less, however, according as the plant is
situated in a fertile or barren country; and do not imitate those who
represent trees of every kind (though at equal distance) with the same
quality of green.Endeavour to vary the colour of meadows, stones,
trunks of trees, and all other objects, as much as possible, for Nature
abounds in variety _ad infinitum_.CCCXXXV./--_The Difference of Climates to be observed._


/Near/ the sea-shore, and in southern parts, you will be careful not to
represent the Winter season by the appearance of trees and fields, as
you would do in places more inland, and in northern countries, except
when these are covered with ever-greens, which shoot afresh all the
year round.CCCXXXVI./--_Of Dust._


/Dust/ becomes lighter the higher it rises, and appears darker the less
it is raised, when it is seen between the eye and the sun.CCCXXXVII./--_How to represent the Wind._


/In/ representing the effect of the wind, besides the bending of trees,
and leaves twisting the wrong side upwards, you will also express the
small dust whirling upwards till it mixes in a confused manner with the
air.CCCXXXVIII./--_Of a Wilderness._


/Those/ trees and shrubs which are by their nature more loaded with
small branches, ought to be touched smartly in the shadows, but those
which have larger foliage, will cause broader shadows.CCCXXXIX./--_Of the Horizon seen in the Water._


/By/ the sixth proposition[85], the horizon will be seen in the water
as in a looking-glass, on that side which is opposite the eye.And
if the painter has to represent a spot covered with water, let him
remember that the colour of it cannot be either lighter or darker than
that of the neighbouring objects.CCCXL./--_Of the Shadow of Bridges on the Surface of the Water._


/The/ shadows of bridges can never be seen on the surface of the water,
unless it should have lost its transparent and reflecting quality,
and become troubled and muddy; because clear water being polished and
smooth on its surface, the image of the bridge is formed in it as in
a looking-glass, and reflected in all the points situated between the
eye and the bridge at equal angles; and even the air is seen under the
arches.These circumstances cannot happen when the water is muddy,
because it does not reflect the objects any longer, but receives the
shadow of the bridge in the same manner as a dusty road would receive
it.CCCXLI./--_How a Painter ought to put in Practice the
Perspective of Colours._


/To/ put in practice that perspective which teaches the alteration, the
lessening, and even the entire loss of the very essence of colours,
you must take some points in the country at the distance of about
sixty-five yards[86] from each other; as trees, men, or some other
remarkable objects.In regard to the first tree, you will take a glass,
and having fixed that well, and also your eye, draw upon it, with the
greatest accuracy, the tree you see through it; then put it a little
on one side, and compare it closely with the natural one, and colour
it, so that in shape and colour it may resemble the original, and that
by shutting one eye they may both appear painted, and at the same
distance.The same rule may be applied to the second and third tree
at the distance you have fixed.These studies will be very useful if
managed with judgment, where they may be wanted in the offscape of a
picture.I have observed that the second tree is less by four fifths
than the first, at the distance of thirteen yards.CCCXLII./--_Various Precepts in Painting._


/The/ superficies of any opake body participates of the colour of the
transparent medium interposed between the eye and such body, in a
greater or less degree, in proportion to the density of such medium and
the space it occupies.The outlines of opake bodies will be less apparent in proportion as
those bodies are farther distant from the eye.That part of the opake body will be the most shaded, or lightest, which
is nearest to the body that shades it, or gives it light.The surface of any opake body participates more or less of the colour
of that body which gives it light, in proportion as the latter is more
or less remote, or more or less strong.Objects seen between lights and shadows will appear to have greater
relievo than those which are placed wholly in the light, or wholly in
shadow.When you give strength and precision to objects seen at a great
distance, they will appear as if they were very near.Endeavour that
your imitation be such as to give a just idea of distances.If the
object in nature appear confused in the outlines, let the same be
observed in your picture.The outlines of distant objects appear undetermined and confused,
for two reasons: the first is, that they come to the eye by so small
an angle, and are therefore so much diminished, that they strike the
sight no more than small objects do, which though near can hardly be
distinguished, such as the nails of the fingers, insects, and other
similar things: the second is, that between the eye and the distant
objects there is so much air interposed, that it becomes thick; and,
like a veil, tinges the shadows with its own whiteness, and turns them
from a dark colour to another between black and white, such as azure.Although, by reason of the great distance, the appearance of many
things is lost, yet those things which receive the light from the sun
will be more discernible, while the rest remain enveloped in confused
shadows.And because the air is thicker near the ground, the things
which are lower will appear confused; and _vice versa_.When the sun tinges the clouds on the horizon with red, those objects
which, on account of their distance, appear blueish, will participate
of that redness, and will produce a mixture between the azure and red,
which renders the prospect lively and pleasant; all the opake bodies
which receive that light will appear distinct, and of a reddish colour,
and the air, being transparent, will be impregnated with it, and appear
of the colour of lilies[87].The air which is between the earth and the sun when it rises or sets,
will always dim the objects it surrounds, more than the air any where
else, because it is whiter.It is not necessary to mark strongly the outlines of any object which
is placed upon another.If the outline or extremity of a white and curved surface terminate
upon another white body, it will have a shade at that extremity, darker
than any part of the light; but if against a dark object, such outline,
or extremity, will be lighter than any part of the light.Those objects which are most different in colour, will appear the most
detached from each other.Those parts of objects which first disappear in the distance, are
extremities similar in colour, and ending one upon the other, as the
extremities of an oak tree upon another oak similar to it.The next to
disappear at a greater distance are, objects of mixed colours, when
they terminate one upon the other, as trees, ploughed fields, walls,
heaps of rubbish, or of stones.The last extremities of bodies that
vanish are those which, being light, terminate upon a dark ground; or
being dark, upon a light ground.Of objects situated above the eye, at equal heights, the farthest
removed from the eye will appear the lowest; and if situated below
the eye, the nearest to it will appear the lowest.The parallel lines
situated sidewise will concur to one point[88].Those objects which are near a river, or a lake, in the distant part of
a landscape, are less apparent and distinct than those that are remote
from them.Of bodies of equal density, those that are nearest to the eye will
appear thinnest, and the most remote thickest.A large eye-ball will see objects larger than a small one.The
experiment may be made by looking at any of the celestial bodies,
through a pin-hole, which being capable of admitting but a portion
of its light, it seems to diminish and lose of its size in the same
proportion as the pin-hole is smaller than the usual apparent size of
the object.A thick air interposed between the eye and any object, will render the
outlines of such object undetermined and confused, and make it appear
of a larger size than it is in reality; because the linear perspective
does not diminish the angle which conveys the object to the eye.The
aerial perspective carries it farther off, so that the one removes it
from the eye, while the other preserves its magnitude[89].When the sun is in the West the vapours of the earth fall down again
and thicken the air, so that objects not enlightened by the sun remain
dark and confused, but those which receive its light will be tinged
yellow and red, according to the sun's appearance on the horizon.Again, those that receive its light are very distinct, particularly
public buildings and houses in towns and villages, because their
shadows are dark, and it seems as if those parts which are plainly seen
were coming out of confused and undetermined foundations, because at
that time every thing is of one and the same colour, except what is
enlightened by the sun[90].Any object receiving the light from the sun, receives also the general
light; so that two kinds of shadows are produced: the darkest of the
two is that which happens to have its central line directed towards the
centre of the sun.The central lines of the primitive and secondary
lights are the same as the central lines of the primitive and secondary
shadows.The setting sun is a beautiful and magnificent object when it tinges
with its colour all the great buildings of towns, villages, and the top
of high trees in the country.All below is confused and almost lost in
a tender and general mass; for, being only enlightened by the air, the
difference between the shadows and the lights is small, and for that
reason it is not much detached.But those that are high are touched
by the rays of the sun, and, as was said before, are tinged with its
colour; the painter therefore ought to take the same colour with which
he has painted the sun, and employ it in all those parts of his work
which receive its light.It also happens very often, that a cloud will appear dark without
receiving any shadow from a separate cloud, according to the situation
of the eye; because it will see only the shady part of the one, while
it sees both the enlightened and shady parts of the other.Of two objects at equal height, that which is the farthest off will
appear the lowest.Observe the first cloud in the cut, though it
is lower than the second, it appears as if it were higher.This is
demonstrated by the section of the pyramidical rays of the low cloud at
M A, and the second (which is higher) at N M, below M A. This happens
also when, on account of the rays of the setting or rising sun, a dark
cloud appears higher than another which is light.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXLIII./--_The Brilliancy of a Landscape._


/The/ vivacity and brightness of colours in a landscape will never bear
any comparison with a landscape in nature when illumined by the sun,
unless the picture be placed so as to receive the same light from the
sun itself.MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.CCCXLIV./--_Why a painted Object does not appear so far distant
as a real one, though they be conveyed to the Eye by equal Angles._


[Illustration]

/If/ a house be painted on the pannel B C, at the apparent distance of
one mile, and by the side of it a real one be perceived at the true
distance of one mile also; which objects are so disposed, that the
pannel, or picture, A C, intersects the pyramidical rays with the same
opening of angles; yet these two objects will never appear of the same
size, nor at the same distance, if seen with both eyes[91].CCCXLV./--_How to draw a Figure standing upon its Feet, to
appear forty Braccia_[92] _high, in a Space of twenty Braccia, with
proportionate Members._


/In/ this, as in any other case, the painter is not to mind what kind
of surface he has to work upon; particularly if his painting is to be
seen from a determined point, such as a window, or any other opening.Because the eye is not to attend to the evenness or roughness of the
wall, but only to what is to be represented as beyond that wall; such
as a landscape, or any thing else.Nevertheless a curved surface, such
as F R G, would be the best, because it has no angles.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXLVI./--_How to draw a Figure twenty-four Braccia high, upon
a Wall twelve Braccia high._ Plate XXII./Draw/ upon part of the wall M N, half the figure you mean to
represent; and the other half upon the cove above, M R. But before
that, it will be necessary to draw upon a flat board, or a paper, the
profile of the wall and cove, of the same shape and dimension, as that
upon which you are to paint.Then draw also the profile of your figure,
of whatever size you please, by the side of it; draw all the lines to
the point F, and where they intersect the profile M R, you will have
the dimensions of your figure as they ought to be drawn upon the real
spot.You will find, that on the straight part of the wall M N, it will
come of its proper form, because the going off perpendicularly will
diminish it naturally; but that part which comes upon the curve will be
diminished upon your drawing.The whole must be traced afterwards upon
the real spot, which is similar to M N. This is a good and safe method._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.CCCXLVII./--_Why, on measuring a Face, and then painting it of
the same Size, it will appear larger than the natural one._


A B is the breadth of the space, or of the head, and it is placed on
the paper at the distance C F, where the cheeks are, and it would have
to stand back all A C, and then the temples would be carried to the
distance O R of the lines A F, B F; so that there is the difference C
O and R D. It follows that the line C F, and the line D F, in order
to become shorter[93], have to go and find the paper where the whole
height is drawn, that is to say, the lines F A, and F B, where the true
size is; and so it makes the difference, as I have said, of C O, and R
D.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXLVIII./--_Why the most perfect Imitation of Nature will not
appear to have the same Relief as Nature itself._


/If/ nature is seen with two eyes, it will be impossible to imitate it
upon a picture so as to appear with the same relief, though the lines,
the lights, shades, and colour, be perfectly imitated[94].It is proved
thus: let the eyes A B, look at the object C, with the concurrence of
both the central visual rays A C and B C. I say, that the sides of the
visual angles (which contain these central rays) will see the space G
D, behind the object C. The eye A will see all the space FD, and the
eye B all the space G E. Therefore the two eyes will see behind the
object C all the space F E; for which reason that object C becomes as
it were transparent, according to the definition of transparent bodies,
behind which nothing is hidden.This cannot happen if an object were
seen with one eye only, provided it be larger than the eye.From all
that has been said, we may conclude, that a painted object, occupying
all the space it has behind, leaves no possible way to see any part of
the ground, which it covers entirely by its own circumference[95].[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXLIX./--_Universality of Painting; a Precept._


/A painter/ cannot be said to aim at universality in the art, unless
he love equally every species of that art.For instance, if he delight
only in landscape, his can be esteemed only as a simple investigation;
and, as our friend Botticello[96] remarks, is but a vain study; since,
by throwing a sponge impregnated with various colours against a wall,
it leaves some spots upon it, which may appear like a landscape.It is
true also, that a variety of compositions may be seen in such spots,
according to the disposition of mind with which they are considered;
such as heads of men, various animals, battles, rocky scenes, seas,
clouds, woods, and the like.It may be compared to the sound of bells,
which may seem to say whatever we choose to imagine.In the same manner
also, those spots may furnish hints for compositions, though they do
not teach us how to finish any particular part; and the imitators of
them are but sorry landscape-painters.CCCL./--_In what Manner the Mirror is the true Master of
Painters._


/When/ you wish to know if your picture be like the object you mean to
represent, have a flat looking-glass, and place it so as to reflect the
object you have imitated, and compare carefully the original with the
copy.You see upon a flat mirror the representation of things which
appear real; Painting is the same.They are both an even superficies,
and both give the idea of something beyond their superficies.Since you
are persuaded that the looking-glass, by means of lines and shades,
gives you the representation of things as if they were real; you being
in possession of colours which in their different lights and shades are
stronger than those of the looking-glass, may certainly, if you employ
the rules with judgment, give to your picture the same appearance of
Nature as you admire in the looking-glass.Or rather, your picture will
be like Nature itself seen in a large looking-glass.This looking-glass (being your master) will shew you the lights and
shades of any object whatever.Amongst your colours there are some
lighter than the lightest part of your model, and also some darker
than the strongest shades; from which it follows, that you ought to
represent Nature as seen in your looking-glass, when you look at it
with one eye only; because both eyes surround the objects too much,
particularly when they are small[97].CCCLI./--_Which Painting is to be esteemed the best._


/That/ painting is the most commendable which has the greatest
conformity to what is meant to be imitated.This kind of comparison
will often put to shame a certain description of painters, who pretend
they can mend the works of Nature; as they do, for instance, when
they pretend to represent a child twelve months old, giving him eight
heads in height, when Nature in its best proportion admits but five.The breadth of the shoulders also, which is equal to the head, they
make double, giving to a child a year old, the proportions of a man of
thirty.They have so often practised, and seen others practise these
errors, that they have converted them into habit, which has taken so
deep a root in their corrupted judgment, that they persuade themselves
that Nature and her imitators are wrong in not following their own
practice[98].CCCLII./--_Of the Judgment to be made of a Painter's Work._


/The/ first thing to be considered is, whether the figures have their
proper relief, according to their respective situations, and the light
they are in: that the shadows be not the same at the extremities of
the groups, as in the middle; because being surrounded by shadows, or
shaded only on one side, produce very different effects.The groups in
the middle are surrounded by shadows from the other figures, which are
between them and the light.Those which are at the extremities have
the shadows only on one side, and receive the light on the other.The
strongest and smartest touches of shadows are to be in the interstice
between the figures of the principal group where the light cannot
penetrate[99].Secondly, that by the order and disposition of the figures they appear
to be accommodated to the subject, and the true representation of the
history in question.Thirdly, that the figures appear alive to the occasion which brought
them together, with expressions suited to their attitudes.CCCLIII./--_How to make an imaginary Animal appear natural._


/It/ is evident that it will be impossible to invent any animal without
giving it members, and these members must individually resemble those
of some known animal.If you wish, therefore, to make a chimera, or imaginary animal, appear
natural (let us suppose a serpent); take the head of a mastiff, the
eyes of a cat, the ears of a porcupine, the mouth of a hare, the
brows of a lion, the temples of an old cock, and the neck of a sea
tortoise[100].CCCLIV./--_Painters are not to imitate one another._


/One/ painter ought never to imitate the manner of any other; because
in that case he cannot be called the child of Nature, but the
grandchild.It is always best to have recourse to Nature, which is
replete with such abundance of objects, than to the productions of
other masters, who learnt every thing from her.CCCLV./--_How to judge of one's own Work._


/It/ is an acknowledged fact, that we perceive errors in the works of
others more readily than in our own.A painter, therefore, ought to
be well instructed in perspective, and acquire a perfect knowledge of
the dimensions of the human body; he should also be a good architect,
at least as far as concerns the outward shape of buildings, with their
different parts; and where he is deficient, he ought not to neglect
taking drawings from Nature.It will be well also to have a looking-glass by him, when he paints,
to look often at his work in it, which being seen the contrary way,
will appear as the work of another hand, and will better shew his
faults.It will be useful also to quit his work often, and take some
relaxation, that his judgment may be clearer at his return; for too
great application and sitting still is sometimes the cause of many
gross errors.CCCLVI./--_Of correcting Errors which you discover._


/Remember/, that when, by the exercise of your own judgment, or the
observation of others, you discover any errors in your work, you
immediately set about correcting them, lest, in exposing your works to
the public, you expose your defects also.Admit not any self-excuse,
by persuading yourself that you shall retrieve your character, and
that by some succeeding work you shall make amends for your shameful
negligence; for your work does not perish as soon as it is out of your
hands, like the sound of music, but remains a standing monument of your
ignorance.If you excuse yourself by saying that you have not time for
the study necessary to form a great painter, having to struggle against
necessity, you yourself are only to blame; for the study of what is
excellent is food both for mind and body.How many philosophers, born
to great riches, have given them away, that they might not be retarded
in their pursuits!CCCLVII./--_The best Place for looking at a Picture._


/Let/ us suppose, that A B is the picture, receiving the light from D;
I say, that whoever is placed between C and E, will see the picture
very badly, particularly if it be painted in oil, or varnished; because
it will shine, and will appear almost of the nature of a looking-glass.For these reasons, the nearer you go towards C, the less you will be
able to see, because of the light from the window upon the picture,
sending its reflection to that point.But if you place yourself between
E D, you may conveniently see the picture, and the more so as you draw
nearer to the point D, because that place is less liable to be struck
by the reflected rays.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCLVIII./--_Of Judgment._


/There/ is nothing more apt to deceive us than our own judgment, in
deciding on our own works; and we should derive more advantage from
having our faults pointed out by our enemies, than by hearing the
opinions of our friends, because they are too much like ourselves, and
may deceive us as much as our own judgment.CCCLIX./--_Of Employment anxiously wished for by Painters._


/And/ you, painter, who are desirous of great practice, understand,
that if you do not rest it on the good foundation of Nature, you will
labour with little honour and less profit; and if you do it on a good
ground your works will be many and good, to your great honour and
advantage.CCCLX./--_Advice to Painters._


/A painter/ ought to study universal Nature, and reason much within
himself on all he sees, making use of the most excellent parts that
compose the species of every object before him.His mind will by this
method be like a mirror, reflecting truly every object placed before
it, and become, as it were, a second Nature.CCCLXI./--_Of Statuary._


/To/ execute a figure in marble, you must first make a model of it in
clay, or plaster, and when it is finished, place it in a square case,
equally capable of receiving the block of marble intended to be shaped
like it.Have some peg-like sticks to pass through holes made in the
sides, and all round the case; push them in till every one touches the
model, marking what remains of the sticks outwards with ink, and making
a countermark to every stick and its hole, so that you may at pleasure
replace them again.Then having taken out the model, and placed the
block of marble in its stead, take so much out of it, till all the pegs
go in at the same holes to the marks you had made.To facilitate the
work, contrive your frame so that every part of it, separately, or all
together, may be lifted up, except the bottom, which must remain under
the marble.By this method you may chop it off with great facility[101].CCCLXII./--_On the Measurement and Division of Statues into
Parts._


/Divide/ the head into twelve parts, each part into twelve degrees,
each degree into twelve minutes, and these minutes into seconds[102].CCCLXIII./--_A Precept for the Painter._


/The/ painter who entertains no doubt of his own ability, will attain
very little.When the work succeeds beyond the judgment, the artist
acquires nothing; but when the judgment is superior to the work, he
never ceases improving, if the love of gain do not <DW44> his progress.CCCLXIV./--_On the Judgment of Painters._


/When/ the work is equal to the knowledge and judgment of the painter,
it is a bad sign; and when it surpasses the judgment, it is still
worse, as is the case with those who wonder at having succeeded so
well.But when the judgment surpasses the work, it is a perfectly good
sign; and the young painter who possesses that rare disposition, will,
no doubt, arrive at great perfection.He will produce few works, but
they will be such as to fix the admiration of every beholder.CCCLXV./--_That a Man ought not to trust to himself, but ought
to consult Nature._


/Whoever/ flatters himself that he can retain in his memory all the
effects of Nature, is deceived, for our memory is not so capacious;
therefore consult Nature for every thing.BOOKS

am informed, had in it altered the back-ground.][Footnote i165: Vasari, 30.][Footnote i166: Vasari, 33.][Footnote i167: Venturi, 4.][Footnote i168: Venturi, 37.][Footnote i170: Vasari, 39.][Footnote i173: Vasari, 44.]This is the picture lately exhibited in Brook
Street, Grosvenor Square, and is said to have been purchased by the
Earl of Warwick.][Footnote 1: This passage has been by some persons much misunderstood,
and supposed to require, that the student should be a deep proficient
in perspective, before he commences the study of painting; but it is
a knowledge of the leading principles only of perspective that the
author here means, and without such a knowledge, which is easily to be
acquired, the student will inevitably fall into errors, as gross as
those humorously pointed out by Hogarth, in his Frontispiece to Kirby's
Perspective.][Footnote 3: Not to be found in this work.][Footnote 4: From this, and many other similar passages, it is evident,
that the author intended at some future time to arrange his manuscript
collections, and to publish them as separate treatises.That he did not
do so is well known; but it is also a fact, that, in selecting from the
whole mass of his collections the chapters of which the present work
consists, great care appears in general to have been taken to extract
also those to which there was any reference from any of the chapters
intended for this work, or which from their subject were necessarily
connected with them.Accordingly, the reader will find, in the notes
to this translation, that all such chapters in any other part of the
present work are uniformly pointed out, as have any relation to the
respective passages in the text.This, which has never before been
done, though indispensably necessary, will be found of singular use,
and it was thought proper here, once for all, to notice it.In the present instance the chapters, referring to the subject in the
text, are Chap.; and though these
do not afford complete information, yet it is to be remembered, that
drawing from relievos is subject to the very same rules as drawing from
Nature; and that, therefore, what is elsewhere said on that subject is
also equally applicable to this.][Footnote 5: The meaning of this is, that the last touches of light,
such as the shining parts (which are always narrow), must be given
sparingly.In short, that the drawing must be kept in broad masses as
much as possible.][Footnote 6: This is not an absolute rule, but it is a very good one
for drawing of portraits.][Footnote 9: See the two preceding chapters.][Footnote 10: Man being the highest of the animal creation, ought to be
the chief object of study.][Footnote 11: An intended Treatise, as it seems, on Anatomy, which
however never was published; but there are several chapters in the
present work on the subject of Anatomy, most of which will be found
under the present head of Anatomy; and of such as could not be placed
there, because they also related to some other branch, the following
is a list by which they may be found: Chapters vi.[Footnote 13: It does not appear that this intention was ever carried
into execution; but there are many chapters in this work on the subject
of motion, where all that is necessary for a painter in this branch
will be found.][Footnote 14: Anatomists have divided this muscle into four or five
sections; but painters, following the ancient sculptors, shew only
the three principal ones; and, in fact, we find that a greater number
of them (as may often be observed in nature) gives a disagreeable
meagreness to the subject.Beautiful nature does not shew more than
three, though there may be more hid under the skin.][Footnote 15: A treatise on weights, like many others, intended by this
author, but never published.][Footnote 17: It is believed that this treatise, like many others
promised by the author, was never written; and to save the necessity of
frequently repeating this fact, the reader is here informed, once for
all, that in the life of the author prefixed to this edition, will be
found an account of the works promised or projected by him, and how far
his intentions have been carried into effect.][Footnote 19: See in this work from chap.[Footnote 22: The author here means to compare the different quickness
of the motion of the head and the heel, when employed in the same
action of jumping; and he states the proportion of the former to be
three times that of the latter.The reason he gives for this is in
substance, that as the head has but one motion to make, while in fact
the lower part of the figure has three successive operations to perform
at the places he mentions, three times the velocity, or, in other
words, three times the degree of effort, is necessary in the head, the
prime mover, to give the power of influencing the other parts; and
the rule deducible from this axiom is, that where two different parts
of the body concur in the same action, and one of them has to perform
one motion only, while the other is to have several, the proportion of
velocity or effort in the former must be regulated by the number of
operations necessary in the latter.][Footnote 23: It is explained in this work, or at least there is
something respecting it in the preceding chapter, and in chap.[Footnote 24: The eyeball moving up and down to look at the hand,
describes a part of a circle, from every point of which it sees it
in an infinite variety of aspects.The hand also is moveable _ad
infinitum_ (for it can go round the whole circle--see chap.),
and consequently shew itself in an infinite variety of aspects, which
it is impossible for any memory to retain.][Footnote 26: About thirteen yards of our measure, the Florentine
braccia, or cubit, by which the author measures, being 1 foot 10 inches
7-8ths English measure.][Footnote 28: It is supposed that the figures are to appear of the
natural size, and not bigger.In that case, the measure of the first,
to be of the exact dimension, should have its feet resting upon the
bottom line; but as you remove it from that, it should diminish.No allusion is here intended to the distance at which a picture is to
be placed from the eye.][Footnote 29: The author does not mean here to say, that one historical
picture cannot be hung over another.It certainly may, because, in
viewing each, the spectator is at liberty (especially if they are
subjects independent of each other) to shift his place so as to stand
at the true point of sight for viewing every one of them; but in
covering a wall with a succession of subjects from the same history,
the author considers the whole as, in fact, but one picture, divided
into compartments, and to be seen at one view, and which cannot
therefore admit more than one point of sight.In the former case, the
pictures are in fact so many distinct subjects unconnected with each
other.]This chapter is obscure, and may probably be made clear by merely
stating it in other words.Leonardo objects to the use of both eyes,
because, in viewing in that manner the objects here mentioned, two
balls, one behind the other, the second is seen, which would not be
the case, if the angle of the visual rays were not too big for the
first object.Whoever is at all acquainted with optics, need not be
told, that the visual rays commence in a single point in the centre, or
nearly the centre of each eye, and continue diverging.But, in using
both eyes, the visual rays proceed not from one and the same centre,
but from a different centre in each eye, and intersecting each other,
as they do a little before passing the first object, they become
together broader than the extent of the first object, and consequently
give a view of part of the second.On the contrary, in using but one
eye, the visual rays proceed but from one centre; and as, therefore,
there cannot be any intersection, the visual rays, when they reach the
first object, are not broader than the first object, and the second is
completely hidden.Properly speaking, therefore, in using both eyes we
introduce more than one point of sight, which renders the perspective
false in the painting; but in using one eye only, there can be, as
there ought, but one point of sight.There is, however, this difference
between viewing real objects and those represented in painting, that in
looking at the former, whether we use one or both eyes, the objects,
by being actually detached from the back ground, admit the visual rays
to strike on them, so as to form a correct perspective, from whatever
point they are viewed, and the eye accordingly forms a perspective of
its own; but in viewing the latter, there is no possibility of varying
the perspective; and, unless the picture is seen precisely under the
same angle as it was painted under, the perspective in all other views
must be false.This is observable in the perspective views painted for
scenes at the playhouse.If the beholder is seated in the central line
of the house, whether in the boxes or pit, the perspective is correct;
but, in proportion as he is placed at a greater or less distance to the
right or left of that line, the perspective appears to him more or less
faulty.And hence arises the necessity of using but one eye in viewing
a painting, in order thereby to reduce it to one point of sight.][Footnote 32: See the Life of the Author prefixed, and chap.[Footnote 33: The author here speaks of unpolished Nature; and indeed
it is from such subjects only, that the genuine and characteristic
operations of Nature are to be learnt.It is the effect of education
to correct the natural peculiarities and defects, and, by so doing, to
assimilate one person to the rest of the world.][Footnote 36: See chapter cclxvii.][Footnote 37: Sir Joshua Reynolds frequently inculcated these precepts
in his lectures, and indeed they cannot be too often enforced.][Footnote 38: Probably this would have formed a part of his intended
Treatise on Light and Shadow, but no such proposition occurs in the
present work.][Footnote 41: This cannot be taken as an absolute rule; it must be left
in a great measure to the judgment of the painter.For much graceful
softness and grandeur is acquired, sometimes, by blending the lights of
the figures with the light part of the ground; and so of the shadows;
as Leonardo himself has observed in chapters cxciv.and Sir
Joshua Reynolds has often put in practice with success.][Footnote 44: He means here to say, that in proportion as the body
interposed between the eye and the object is more or less transparent,
the greater or less quantity of the colour of the body interposed will
be communicated to the object.][Footnote 45: See the note to chap.[Footnote 46: See the preceding chapter, and chap.[Footnote 47: The appearance of motion is lessened according to the
distance, in the same proportion as objects diminish in size.][Footnote 50: This was intended to constitute a part of some book of
Perspective, which we have not; but the rule here referred to will be
found in chap.[Footnote 52: No such work was ever published, nor, for any thing that
appears, ever written.][Footnote 53: The French translation of 1716 has a note on this
chapter, saying, that the invention of enamel painting found out since
the time of Leonardo da Vinci, would better answer to the title of this
chapter, and also be a better method of painting.I must beg leave,
however, to dissent from this opinion, as the two kinds of painting
are so different, that they cannot be compared.Leonardo treats of oil
painting, but the other is vitrification.Leonardo is known to have
spent a great deal of time in experiments, of which this is a specimen,
and it may appear ridiculous to the practitioners of more modern
date, as he does not enter more fully into a minute description of
the materials, or the mode of employing them.The principle laid down
in the text appears to me to be simply this: to make the oil entirely
evaporate from the colours by the action of fire, and afterwards to
prevent the action of the air by the means of a glass, which in itself
is an excellent principle, but not applicable, any more than enamel
painting to large works.][Footnote 54: It is evident that distemper or size painting is here
meant.][Footnote 56: This rule is not without exception: see chap.[Footnote 59: See chapters ccxlvii.Probably they were intended to form a part of a distinct treatise, and
to have been ranged as propositions in that, but at present they are
not so placed.][Footnote 62: Although the author seems to have designed that this, and
many other propositions to which he refers, should have formed a part
of some regular work, and he has accordingly referred to them whenever
he has mentioned them, by their intended numerical situation in that
work, whatever it might be, it does not appear that he ever carried
this design into execution.There are, however, several chapters in
the present work, viz.in which the
principle in the text is recognised, and which probably would have been
transferred into the projected treatise, if he had ever drawn it up.][Footnote 63: The note on the preceding chapter is in a great measure
applicable to this, and the proposition mentioned in the text is also
to be found in chapter ccxlvii.[Footnote 64: See the note on the chapter next but one preceding.The
proposition in the text occurs in chap.[Footnote 66: I do not know a better comment on this passage than
Felibien's Examination of Le Brun's Picture of the Tent of Darius.From this (which has been reprinted with an English translation, by
Colonel Parsons in 1700, in folio) it will clearly appear, what the
chain of connexion is between every colour there used, and its nearest
neighbour, and consequently a rule may be formed from it with more
certainty and precision than where the student is left to develope
it for himself, from the mere inspection of different examples of
colouring.]We have before remarked, that the propositions so
frequently referred to by the author, were never reduced into form,
though apparently he intended a regular work in which they were to be
included.][Footnote 68: No where in this work.][Footnote 69: This is evident in many of Vandyke's portraits,
particularly of ladies, many of whom are dressed in black velvet; and
this remark will in some measure account for the delicate fairness
which he frequently gives to the female complexion.][Footnote 70: These propositions, any more than the others mentioned
in different parts of this work, were never digested into a regular
treatise, as was evidently intended by the author, and consequently are
not to be found, except perhaps in some of the volumes of the author's
manuscript collections.][Footnote 73: This book on perspective was never drawn up.][Footnote 76: There is no work of this author to which this can at
present refer, but the principle is laid down in chapters cclxxxiv.[Footnote 77: See chapters cccvii.[Footnote 80: To our obtaining a correct idea of the magnitude and
distance of any object seen from afar, it is necessary that we consider
how much of distinctness an object loses at a distance (from the mere
interposition of the air), as well as what it loses in size; and these
two considerations must unite before we can decidedly pronounce as to
its distance or magnitude.This calculation, as to distinctness, must
be made upon the idea that the air is clear, as, if by any accident it
is otherwise, we shall (knowing the proportion in which clear air dims
a prospect) be led to conclude this farther off than it is, and, to
justify that conclusion, shall suppose its real magnitude correspondent
with the distance, at which from its degree of distinctness it appears
to be.In the circumstance remarked in the text there is, however, a
great deception; the fact is, that the colour and the minute parts of
the object are lost in the fog, while the size of it is not diminished
in proportion; and the eye being accustomed to see objects diminished
in size at a great distance, supposes this to be farther off than it
is, and consequently imagines it larger.][Footnote 81: This proposition, though undoubtedly intended to form a
part of some future work, which never was drawn up, makes no part of
the present.][Footnote 84: See chapter ccxcviii.][Footnote 85: This was probably to have been a part of some other work,
but it does not occur in this.][Footnote 86: Cento braccia, or cubits.The Florence braccio is one
foot ten inches seven eighths, English measure.][Footnote 87: Probably the Author here means yellow lilies, or fleurs
de lis.][Footnote 88: That point is always found in the horizon, and is called
the point of sight, or the vanishing point.][Footnote 91: This position has been already laid down in chapter
cxxiv.(and will also be found in chapter cccxlviii.); and the reader
is referred to the note on that passage, which will also explain that
in the text, for further illustration.It may, however, be proper to
remark, that though the author has here supposed both objects conveyed
to the eye by an angle of the same extent, they cannot, in fact, be so
seen, unless one eye be shut; and the reason is this: if viewed with
both eyes, there will be two points of sight, one in the centre of each
eye; and the rays from each of these to the objects must of course be
different, and will consequently form different angles.][Footnote 92: The braccio is one foot ten inches and seven eighths
English measure.]To be abridged according to the rules of
perspective.][Footnote 95: The whole of this chapter, like the next but one
preceding, depends on the circumstance of there being in fact two
points of sight, one in the centre of each eye, when an object is
viewed with both eyes.In natural objects the effect which this
circumstance produces is, that the rays from each point of sight,
diverging as they extend towards the object, take in not only that, but
some part also of the distance behind it, till at length, at a certain
distance behind it, they cross each other; whereas, in a painted
representation, there being no real distance behind the object, but the
whole being a flat surface, it is impossible that the rays from the
points of sight should pass beyond that flat surface; and as the object
itself is on that flat surface, which is the real extremity of the
view, the eyes cannot acquire a sight of any thing beyond.][Footnote 96: A well-known painter at Florence, contemporary with
Leonardo da Vinci, who painted several altar-pieces and other public
works.][Footnote 100: Leonardo da Vinci was remarkably fond of this kind of
invention, and is accused of having lost a great deal of time that way.][Footnote 101: The method here recommended, was the general and common
practice at that time, and continued so with little, if any variation,
till lately.But about thirty years ago, the late Mr.Bacon invented
an entirely new method, which, as better answering the purpose,
he constantly used, and from him others have also adopted it into
practice.][Footnote 102: This may be a good method of dividing the figure for the
purpose of reducing from large to small, or _vice versa_; but it not
being the method generally used by the painters for measuring their
figures, as being too minute, this chapter was not introduced amongst
those of general proportions.]He will leave the
army rather than order his men to fire on the factory workers.Around
him stand the members of the military caste, linked together by
tradition and family relationship.His father is a colonel in the same
regiment; the father of his fiancée, Martha, is commanding officer.One
friend he has: an army doctor named Berens, who has infected himself
with cancer serum in attempting to discover a cure for the disease,
and passes for a drunkard because he keeps the symptoms in check by
alcohol.Here a parallel is drawn between military bravery and the
civilian courage of the scientist.Mari is put under arrest, but the affair is kept secret in order to
avoid a scandal.He can only be reinstated by full withdrawal and
apology.Martha comes to him and implores him to withdraw.He can plead the excitement of the moment
in excuse, and the matter will be settled honorably.A friendly discussion of the point with his superior
officers is interrupted by a volley in the street outside.The troops
have fired upon the mob, and the son of the shoemaker over the way
has been shot.Mari sends in his papers; but a newspaper has published the facts of
the case, and he is met with the disgrace of immediate dismissal from
the army.She must marry a soldier; civilian
life with a dismissed lieutenant was not in the bond.So Mari suffers
another disillusionment, and the end of the play sees him setting
out from home, while the old shoemaker is left to lament for his son.A warm heart, a weakness for rhetoric,
and--a study in vacillation.In Ora et Labora Heijermans is less rhetorical; rather, one suspects,
for lack of a mouthpiece.His peasants bear their fate, if not in
silence, with almost inarticulate resignation.They are too hungry to
waste words.Moreover, there is no visible enemy to denounce, no Coat
of Mail, no racial prejudice, no insatiate capitalism.Winter is the
villain of the piece.This is indeed naturalism, in the literal sense;
humanity devoured by Nature.Everything is frost-bound: the canal,
the soil, the very cattle.When the last cow upon the farm dies of disease, its throat
is cut so that it can be sold to the butcher.All hopes are centred
in the father of the family, who is to sell the carcase in the town;
but he spends the money and returns home drunk.As a last resort,
his son Eelke enlists in the army for six years' colonial service,
leaving Sytske, the girl he was about to marry.His advance pay buys
fuel and food, but the lovers part with a hopeless quarrel, and the
old peasants are left wrangling over the money he has brought.Allerzielen (1906) is a later work.A village pastor finds a woman
in a state of collapse upon his threshold.He takes her in, and she
gives birth to a child.She is a stranger in the district, Rita by
name.The child is sent into the village to be nursed, while the
pastor gives up his own room to the mother.She recovers slowly, and
meanwhile the peasants set their tongues to work upon the scandal.A good village housewife is
suckling a bastard.The pastor is housing an outcast, and shows no
sign of sending her about her business.Dimly and distantly the Bishop is said to be considering
the facts.... Amid alarums and excursions the affair pursues its
course.The village passes from astonishment to ribaldry, from ribaldry
to stone-throwing.The pastor speaks gently of Christian charity and
souls to be saved, but fails to appease his parishioners.They are
hot upon the scent in a heresy-hunt.If they could see within the
parsonage walls, they would yelp still louder.For Rita proves to be
an unblushing hedonist.No prayers for her, when the birth-pangs are
once over; no tears, no repentance.She sings gaily in her room while
the pastors argue about duty and morals.She
invades the study to enjoy a view of sunlight, clouds and sea.She
finds the waves more musical than the wheezing of the church organ.If
only the child were with her, her happiness would be complete.But the child is neglected by its foster mother.The pastor is driven from his church by the Bishop, and leaves
the broken windows of the parsonage to his successor.Rita and he
are both homeless now.And then the child's father comes,--another
hedonist.Its body lies in
unconsecrated ground, but the vows of love are renewed at the
graveside.All roads are
open to the spirits of the free.The pastor can only offer a hopeless
"Farewell" as the two set out upon their way.But Rita calls after,
"No,--no!It matters nothing that this gospel of Life has often been
preached.Heijermans has caught the spirit of it as well as the
letter.His characters say and do nothing particularly original;
nothing that would even pass for originality by reason of its
manner.He works in vivid contrasts, without a shade of paradox.He
figures the opposed forces of Reaction and Revolution in religion,
in statecraft, in economics, in all human relationships, with a
simplicity of mind which would draw a smile from the forever up-to-date
"intellectual."Reaction is a devilish superstition; Revolution
a prophetic angel pointing the way to the promised land.The one
is false, the other true.There is no disputing the point, since
truth and falsehood are absolute terms.Perhaps the secret is that
Heijermans never tires of his own philosophy.He is content to see it
firmly planted on the ground; he does not demand that it should walk
the tight-rope or turn somersaults as an intellectual exercise.He
has accepted a view of life which some call materialistic, and others
positivist, or scientific, or humanitarian; but for him it is simply
humane,--founded upon social justice and human need.A philosophy, however, does not make a dramatist.In the plays I
have already described Heijermans shows his power of translating
the world-struggle of thought into the dramatic clash of will, but
it is upon "The Good Hope" (Op Hoop van Zegen) that his reputation
chiefly depends.He chooses a great subject; not merely the conflict
of shipowners and fishermen in the struggle for existence, but the
sea-faring life and the ocean itself.Truly "a sea-piece"; tempestuous,
powerful.From the opening
scene, with the old men's tale of sharks, to the night of the storm
in the third act, when the women and children huddle in Kneirtje's
cottage for shelter, the story is always the same.The sea is the
symbol of Fate.It takes a father here, a brother there.It seizes
Geert and Barend alike; the one going aboard carelessly, the other
screaming resistance.Sometimes it plays with its victims on shore,
making no sign, leaving months of hope to end in despair.In a more
merciful mood it sends children running through the village to cry
"'n Ball op!as an overdue ship is signalled from the
coastguard tower.And there an echo of the sea-ballad now and again;
when raps are heard upon the door at the height of the storm, or
a flapping curtain blows out the lamp, or a pallid face is seen at
the window....

In sheer force of theatrical construction "The Good Hope" is still
more striking.The play is
full of natural rather than violent coincidence.Barend has always
feared death by drowning, and he makes his first and last voyage in
a leaky trawler.His father sank in a wreck, and it is his mother,
unable to maintain the household, who persuades him to go.She fears
the disgrace of his refusal after the papers are signed, but he is
dragged aboard by the harbour police.His brother Geert sets out
proudly enough, singing the Marseillaise and preaching rebellion;
but he sinks far away, impotent, unheard, and leaves his sweetheart
to bear a fatherless child.Old Cobus can only reflect, "We take
the fishes, and God takes us."That is perhaps the most dramatic
thread of all,--the parallel of fate.The struggle for existence on
land drives men to the fishing-boats and the Dogger Bank.From the
minnows to leviathan, there is no escape."We take the fishes, and
God takes us."A gale of wind and rain whistles through the play,
sweeping the decks of life, tossing men out into the unknown.The ship-owner, Bos, is frankly
a villain.He knows "The Good Hope" is unseaworthy, but he allows her
to sail.True, the warning comes from a drunken ship's carpenter,
but he understands the risks.The ship is
well insured....

It is implied, then, that shipowners are unscrupulous scoundrels,
and fishermen their unhappy victims.Here is a bias which makes
the actual tragedy no more impressive.Good ships, as well as bad,
may perish in a storm.Nature is cruel enough without the help of
man.The problem of the big fish and the little fish is one of size,
not of morality.Even sharks may possibly rejoice in an amiable
temperament.It can only be said that Heijermans has here chosen the
right motive for his own particular type of drama.He knows that, humanly speaking, in every conflict
between employers and employed, the men are right and the masters
wrong.Impossible to redress the balance by individual virtue or
kindliness.The masters stand for the exploiting system; for capital,
for insurance, for power, for law and order and possession.Their
risks are less and their temptations greater.Even from the standpoint
of abstract justice, a dishonest employer may fairly be set against
a drunken labourer or a gaol-bird fisherman.The one is no less
natural than the other.But Heijermans goes beyond all finicking
considerations of this sort.He seeks to destroy and rebuild, not
to repair or adjust.He avoids mere naturalism; the "conscientious
transcription of all the visible and repetition of all the audible"
is not for him.And here he is undoubtedly justified, not only by
his own experience, but by that of other dramatists.There was no
inspiration in the movement towards mere actuality on the stage.It
sickened of its own surfeit of "life."Its accumulated squalor became
intolerable.It was choked by its own irrelevance, circumscribed
by its own narrowness.For naturalism is like a prison courtyard;
it offers only two ways of escape.One is the poet's upward flight,
the other the revolutionist's battering-ram.Heijermans has chosen
his own weapon, and used it well.He has given us "The Good Hope,"
not as a mere pitiful study in disillusionment, but as a tragic symbol
of human effort in the conquest of despair.Kneirtje, a fisherman's widow.Geert   }

much.Barend, you help him----

CLEM.There is a ten-cent piece out there.[Basket of driftwood on his back.]Give it to 'im in his paws
then.[Throws down basket with a thud.]Say there, big ape, were you speaking to me?I did not know you were there,
I thought----

COB.What right had you to think--better be thinking of going to sea
again to earn your Mother's bread.Just hear his insolence to me--when he's too bashful to open
his mouth to others.I'm not afraid--he-he-he!--No,
I don't get the belly ache when I must go to sea--he-he-he!He can't do it, Miss, we must pull weeds in the court yard.No, it was ebb last night--and--and--[Gets stuck.]Are you really afraid to go to sea, silly boy?A man must not be afraid----

BAR.I won't force you to go--How old are you?For my--for my--I don't know why, but I was rejected.That's lucky--A soldier that's afraid!I'm not afraid on land--let them come at
me--I'll soon stick a knife through their ribs![The soft
tooting of a steamboat whistle is heard.]That's the Anna--there's
a corpse on board----

CLEM.Tu-tu-tu-tu--The second this week.First, the Agatha Maria----

BAR.The Agatha was last week--Do they know who?Ach--you get used to it--and none of our family are
aboard.Father can't--Hendrick can't--Josef
can't--you know about them--and--and--Geert--he's still under arrest.Yes, he's brought disgrace on all of you.Disgrace--disgrace----

CLEM.They gave him six months--but they deduct the time before
trial--we don't know how long that was, so we can't tell.[Goes off indifferently, chases away the
chickens, outside.]Then we'll--such a lazy boy, I wish he'd never been
born--Sponger!--Are you going so soon, Miss?I am curious to know what's happened on the Anna.Yes--I was on the way there--but it takes so long--and I've
had my fill of waiting on the pier--if that pier could only talk.I want to make a drawing of Barend also--just as he
came in with the basket on his shoulders.He doesn't seem to get much petting around here.The sooner I get rid of
him, the better!Say, he's enjoying himself there on Ari's roof.Brown apron--gold head pieces
on the black band around her head.]The rooster is sitting on Ari's
roof.She knows well enough we almost came
to blows with Ari because the hens walked in his potato patch.I let them out myself, old cross patch--Truus dug their potatoes
yesterday.Oh, Miss--she would die if she couldn't
grumble; she even keeps it up in her sleep.Last night she swore out
loud in her dreams.scold all you like; you're a
good old mother just the same.[To Barend, who enters the room.]I'll wager if you pet the hens he will come down of himself from
jealousy.Say, Aunt, you should make a baker of him.His little bare feet
in the rye flour.You can all----[Goes angrily off at left.]Tja; since four o'clock this morning.We poor people are surely cursed--rain--rain--the crops had
to rot--they couldn't be saved--and so we go into the winter--the
cruel winter--Ach,--Ach,--Ach!You don't add
to your potatoes by fretting and grumbling.I have to talk like this
all day to keep up her spirits--See, I caught a rabbit!The rascal was living on our poverty--the
trap went snap as I was digging.A fat one--forty cents at the least.Are you going to stay all day--May I come in?Of course you may, Meneer; come in, Meneer.A little dry sand doesn't matter--will you
sit down?Glad to do so--Yes, Kneir, my girl, we're getting older every
day--Good day, little niece.The hornpipe and the Highland fling, hey?No, you don't understand it, anyway.Have her take drawing
lessons, but must not ask to see--come!Well, Barend, you come as if you were called.You're quite a man, now--How long have you been out of a job?That's a lie--It's more than a year.Well, just count up--November, December--

BOS.Well,
Barend, how would the forty-seven suit you?--Eh, what?----

BAR.The forty-seven----

BOS.Are you going to send out the Good Hope?----

BOS.How contemptible, to get mad--how
small--Bonjour!Just like her Mama, I have to raise the
devil now and then,--hahaha!--or my wife and daughter would run
the business--and I would be in the kitchen peeling the potatoes,
hahaha!Not but what I've done it in my youth.And don't I remember----

BOS.With a fleet of eight luggers your mind is on other
things--[Smiling.]Even if I do like the sight of saucy black
eyes--Don't mind me, I'm not dangerous--there was a time.----Hahaha!Well, our little friend here, what does he say?I would rather----

KNEIR.What a stupid!----

BOS.Last
year at the herring catch the Good Hope made the sum of fourteen
hundred guilders in four trips.She is fully equipped, Hengst is
skipper--all the sailors but one--and the boys--Hengst spoke of you
for oldest boy.No, no, Meneer----

KNEIR.If I were a man----

BOS.Yes, but you're not; you're a pretty girl--ha, ha, ha!You've already made one trip as middle boy----

KNEIR.Yes, I,
too, would rather have sat by Mother's pap-pot than held eels with
my ice cold hands; rather bitten into a slice of bread and butter
than bitten off the heads of the bait.My father was drowned--and brother Hendrick--and
Josef--no, I won't go!Well--if he feels that way--better not force him,
Mother Kneirtje; I understand how he feels, my father didn't die
in his bed, either--but if you begin to reason that way the whole
fishery goes up the spout.It's enough to----

BOS.Softly--softly--You don't catch tipsy herrings with force----

JO.Tipsy herring, I would like to see that!She doesn't believe it, Kneir!Ach--it's no joking matter, Meneer, that miserable bad
boy talks as if--as if--I had forgotten my husband--and my good
Josef--and--and--but I have not.please, Aunty dear!--Good-for-nothing Torment!Tears will not restore the dead to life----

KNEIR.No, Meneer--I know that, Meneer.Next month it will be twelve
years since the Clementine went down.November--'88--He was a monkey of seven then, and yet he
pretends to feel more than I do about it.I don't remember my father,
nor my brothers--but--but----

BOS.I want another trade--I don't want to go to sea--no--no----

KNEIR.Can't even read or
write----

BAR.Three years I had an allowance--the
first year three--the second two twenty-five--and the third one
dollar--the other nine I had to root around for myself.I shall always be grateful to you, Meneer.If you and the
priest hadn't given me work and a warm bite now and then to take
home--then--then--and that booby even reproaches me!----

BAR.I don't reproach--I--I----

JO.The gentleman is looking for a place to live off
his income.Shut up!--I will do anything--dig sand--plant broom--salting
down--I'll be a mason, or a carpenter--or errand boy----

JO.And walk about dark
nights to catch thieves--Oh!--Oh!--what a brave man!You make me tired!--Did I complain when the salt ate the flesh
off my paws so I couldn't sleep nights with the pain?Wants to be a carpenter--the boy is insane--A mason--see the
accidents that happen to masons.Yes, Barendje--There are risks in all trades--my boy.Just think
of the miners, the machinists, the stokers--the--the--How often do
not I, even now, climb the man rope, or row out to a lugger?God alone knows what the winter will
be.All the potatoes rotted late this fall, Meneer.Get out of my house, then--sponger![A pause during which Barend walks timidly away.]If I had a son like that----

BOS.Better get a lover first----

JO.I've already got one!--If I had a son like that I'd
bang him right and left!A sailor
never knows that sooner or later--He never thinks of that--If Geert
were that way--there, I know--Aunt, imagine--Geert----

BOS.He'd face the devil--eh, Aunt?Now, I'm going to finish the
potatoes.Say, black eyes--do you laugh all the time?[Calls back from
the opened door.]Geert?--Is that your son, who----

KNEIR.Yes, Meneer--Couldn't keep his hands at
home.I think they must have teased him----

BOS.Discipline would be thrown overboard to the sharks if
sailors could deal out blows every time things didn't go to suit them.That's so, Meneer, but----

BOS.And is she--smitten with that good-for-nothing?She's crazy about him, and well she may be.He's a handsome
lad, takes after his father--and strong--there is his photograph--he
still wore the uniform then--first class--now he is----

BOS.Degraded?----

KNEIR.He's been to India twice--it
is hard--if he comes next week--or in two weeks--or tomorrow, I don't
know when--I'll have him to feed, too--although--I must say it of
him, he won't let the grass grow under his feet--A giant like him
can always find a skipper.A sweet beast--I tell you right now, Kneir, I'd rather not take
him--dissatisfied scoundrels are plenty enough these days--All that
come from the Navy, I'm damned if it isn't so--are unruly and I have
no use for that kind--Am I not right?Certainly, Meneer, but my boy----

BOS.There was Jacob--crooked Jacob, the skipper had to discharge
him.He was, God save him, dissatisfied with everything--claimed
that I cheated at the count--yes--yes--insane.Now he's trying it at
Maassluis.May I send him to the skipper then--or direct to the water
bailiff's office?Yes, but you tell him----

KNEIR.If he comes in time, he can go out on the Good Hope.They are bringing the provisions and casks aboard
now.She'll come back with a full cargo--You know that.Pieterse's steam trawler--The deuce![Both go off--the stage remains empty--a vague murmur of voices
outside.Fishermen, in conversation, pass the window.Geert sneaks inside through the door at
left.Throws down a bundle tied in a red handkerchief.Looks cautiously
into the bedsteads, the cooking shed, peers through the window, then
muttering he plumps down in a chair by the table, rests his head on
his hand, rises again; savagely takes a loaf of bread from the back
cupboard, cuts off a hunk.Walks back to chair, chewing, lets the
bread fall; wrathfully stares before him.Who's there?--Geert!--[Entering.]Yes--it's me--Well, why don't you give me a paw.No, where is she----

BAR.Mother, she--she----

GEERT.You look so--so pale----

GEERT.No, fine!--What a question--They feed you on beefsteaks!Go and get some then--if I don't have a swallow, I'll keel over.[Peers in his pocket, throws a handful of coins on
the table.]Earned that in prison--There!----

BAR.I don't care a damn--so you hurry.Don't stare so, stupid----

BAR.I can't get used to your face--it's so queer.I must grow a beard at once!--Say, did they
make a devil of a row?Jo enters, a dead rabbit in her hand.][Lets the rabbit fall.]--Geert![Rushes to him, throws
her arms about his neck, sobbing hysterically.]I am so happy--so happy, dear Geert----

GEERT.My head can't
stand such a lot of noise----

JO.You don't understand it of course--six months
solitary--in a dirty, stinking cell.[Puts his hand before his eyes
as if blinded by the light.]Drop the curtain a bit--This sunshine
drives me mad!My God--Geert----

GEERT.They didn't like my beard--The government took that--become
ugly, haven't I?--Look as if I'd lost my wits?The
beggars; to shut up a sailor in a cage where you can't walk, where you
can't speak, where you--[Strikes wildly upon the table with his fist.]Don't you meddle with this--Where is a glass?--Never
mind--[Swallows eagerly.][Puts the bottle again to
his lips.]Please, Geert--no more--you can't stand it.That's the best way
to tan your stomach.Don't look so unhappy,
girl--I won't get drunk!Not accustomed to it--Are
there any provisions on board?That will do for tomorrow--Here, you, go and lay in a
supply--some ham and some meat----

BAR.No--that's extravagance--If you want to buy meat, keep your money
till Sunday.Sunday--Sunday--If you hadn't eaten anything for six months but
rye bread, rats, horse beans--I'm too weak to set one foot before the
other.and--and a piece of cheese--I feel
like eating myself into a colic.God!--I'm glad to see you cheerful again.Yes, there's some
tobacco left--in the jar.Who did you flirt with, while I sat----

JO.Haven't
had the taste in my mouth for half a year.This isn't tobacco;
[Exhales.]The gin stinks and the pipe stinks.You'll sleep nice and warm up there, dear.Why is the looking-glass on
the floor?No--it's me--Geert----

KNEIR.You--what have you done to make me happy!Never mind that now----

GEERT.If you intend to reproach
me?--I shall----

KNEIR.Pack my bundle!----

KNEIR.Do you expect me to sit on the sinner's bench?The whole village talked about you--I
couldn't go on an errand but----

GEERT.Let them that talk say it to my face.No, but you raised your hand against your superior.I should have twisted my fingers in his throat.Boy--boy; you make us all unhappy.Treated like a beast, then I get the devil
besides.[At the door,
hesitates, throws down his bundle.]Don't cry,
Mother--I would rather--Damn it!Please--Auntie dear----

KNEIR.Never would he have
looked at you again--And he also had a great deal to put up with.I'm glad I'm different--not so submissive--It's a great honor
to let them walk over you!I have no fish blood in me--Now then,
is it to go on raining?I'd knock the teeth out of his jaw tomorrow.I've sat long enough, hahaha!--Let me walk to get the hang of
it.Now I'll--But for you it would never have happened----

JO.But for me?--that's a good
one!That cad--Don't you remember dancing with him at the tavern
van de Rooie?I?--Danced?----

GEERT.With that cross-eyed quartermaster?--I don't understand a word
of it--was it with him?--And you yourself wanted me to----

GEERT.You can't refuse a superior--On board ship he had stories.I
overheard him tell the skipper that he----

JO.That he--never mind what--He spoke of you as if you were any
sailor's girl.I!--The low down----

GEERT.When he came into the hold after the dog watch, I hammered
him on the jaw with a marlin spike.Five minutes later I sat in
irons.Kept in them six days--[Sarcastically.]the provost was full;
then two weeks provost; six months solitary; and suspended from the
navy for ten years; that, damn me, is the most--I'd chop off my two
hands to get back in; to be <DW65>-driven again; cursed as a beggar
again; ruled as a slave again----

KNEIR.Geert--Geert--Don't speak such words.In the Bible it stands
written----

GEERT.Stands written--If there was only something written
for us----

KNEIR.If he had gone politely to the Commander----

GEERT.You should have been a sailor,
Mother--Hahaha!They were too glad of the chance to clip and
shear me.While I was in the provost they found newspapers in my bag I
was not allowed to read--and pamphlets I was not allowed to read--that
shut the door--otherwise they would have given me only third class----

KNEIR.Newspapers you were not allowed to read?Why--simple soul--Ach!--when I look at your submissive face I
see no way to tell why--Why do men desert?--Why, ten days before this
happened to me, did Peter the stoker cut off his two fingers?--Just
for a joke?I can't blame you people--you knew no
better--and I admired the uniform--But now that I've got some brains
I would like to warn every boy that binds himself for fourteen years
to murder.Boy, don't say such dreadful things--you are
excited----

GEERT.No--not at all--worn out, in fact--in Atjeh I fought
with the rest--stuck my bayonet into the body of a poor devil till the
blood spurted into my eyes--For that they gave me the Atjeh medal.[Jo picks up the bundle;
Barend looks on.][Jerks the medal from his
jacket, throws it out of the window.]you have dangled on my
breast long enough!I no longer know
you----

GEERT.Who--who took an innocent boy, that couldn't count ten, and
kidnaped him for fourteen years?Who drilled and trained him for a
dog's life?Who put him in irons when he defended his girl?Irons--you
should have seen me walking in them, groaning like an animal.Near me
walked another animal with irons on his leg, because of an insolent
word to an officer of the watch.Six days with the damned irons on
your claws and no power to break them.Don't talk about it any more, you are still so tired----

GEERT.[Wrapped in the grimness of his story.]Then the provost,
that stinking, dark cage; your pig stye is a palace to it.A cage
with no windows--no air--a cage where you can't stand or lie down.A
cage where your bread and water is flung to you with a "there, dog,
eat!"There was a big storm in those days,--two sloops were battered to
pieces;--when you expected to go to the bottom any moment.Never again
to see anyone belongin' to me--neither you--nor you--nor you.To go
down in that dark, stinking hole with no one to talk to--no comrade's
hand!--No, no, let me talk--it lightens my chest!A fellow has lots to
bring in there.Gold
epaulettes sitting in judgment on the trash God has kicked into the
world to serve, to salute, to----

KNEIR.Six months--six months in a cell for reformation.To be reformed
by eating food you could not swallow;--rye bread, barley, pea soup,
rats!Three months I pasted paper bags, and when I saw the chance I
ate the sour paste from hunger.Three months I sorted peas; you'll
not believe it, but may I never look on the sea again if I lie.At
night, over my gas light, I would cook the peas I could nip in my
slop pail.When the handle became too hot to hold any longer, I ate
them half boiled--to fill my stomach.That's to reform you--reform
you--for losing your temper and licking a blackguard that called your
girl a vile name, and reading newspapers you were not allowed to read.Fresh from the sea--in a cell--no
wind and no water, and no air--one small high window with grating like
a partridge cage.The foul smell and the nights--the damned nights,
when you couldn't sleep.When you sprang up and walked, like an insane
man, back and forth--back and forth--four measured paces.The nights
when you sat and prayed not to go insane--and cursed everything,
everything, everything![After a long pause goes to him and throws her arms about his
neck.Kneirtje weeps, Barend stands dazed.]Don't let us--[Forcibly controlling his tears.][Goes to the window--says to Barend.]Lay
out the good things--[Draws up the curtain.]if the
rooster isn't sitting on the roof again, ha, ha, ha!I would like to sail at once--two days on the Sea!the
Sea!--and I'm my old self again.What?--Why is Truus crying as she
walks by?Ssst!--Don't call after her.The Anna has just come in without
her husband.[A few sad-looking, low-speaking women walk past the
window.][Drops the window
curtain, stands in somber thought.]That is to say----

MARIETJE.Yes--I won't go far--I must----

MARIETJE.Well, Salamander, am I a child?I must--I must----[Abruptly
off.]You should have seen him day before yesterday--half the
village at his heels.When Mother was living he didn't
dare.She used to slap his face for him when he smelled of gin--just
let me try it.You say that as though--ha ha ha!I never have seen Mees drinking--and father very seldom
formerly.Ah well--I can't put a cork in his mouth, nor lead him
around by a rope.Gone, of course--to
the Rooie.Young for her years, isn't she, eh?Sit down and tell me
[Merrily.]You know we would
like to marry at once [Smiles, hesitates.]because--because----Well,
you understand.But Mees had to send for his papers first--that takes
two weeks--by that time he is far out at sea; now five weeks--five
little weeks will pass quickly enough.That's about the same----Are you two!----Now?----I told
you everything----

[Jo shrugs her shoulders and laughs.]May you live to be a hundred----

KNEIR.You may try one--you, too--gingerbread nuts--no,
not two, you, with the grab-all fingers!For each of the boys a
half pound gingerbread nuts--and a half pound chewing tobacco--and
a package of cigars.Do you know what I'm going to give Barend since
he has become so brave--look----

JO.Now--you should give those to Geert----

KNEIR.No, I'm so pleased with the lad that he has made up his mind
I want to reward him.These are ever so old, they are earrings.My
husband wore them Sundays, when he was at home.There are little ships on them--masts--and sails--I wish
I had them for a brooch.You had a time getting him to sign--Eh!But he was willing to go with his brother--and
now take it home to yourself--a boy that is not strong--not very
strong--rejected for the army, and a boy who heard a lot about his
father and Josef.First you curse and scold at him, and
now nothing is too good.In an hour he will be gone,
and you must never part in anger.We
have fresh wafers and ginger cakes all laid in for my birthday--set it
all ready, Jo.Saart is coming soon, and the boys may take a dram, too.A sweet young Miss
    And a glass of Anis--
    I shall surely come in for this.[Hides it in his red handkerchief.]No--now--you
know what I want to say.I don't need to ask if----[Pours the dram.]No--no--go ahead--just a little more.No matter, I shan't spill a drop.Lips to the glass, sucks up the liquor.]When you have my years!--Hardly slept a wink last night--and
no nap this afternoon.That's what he would like to do----

MARIETJE.Now, if I had my choice----

KNEIR.The Matron at the Home has to
help dress him.the Englishman says: "The old man misses the kisses, and
the young man kisses the misses."Yes, that means, "Woman, take your cat inside, its beginning to
rain."Good day, Daantje; day, Cobus; and day, Marietje; and day,
Jo.No, I'm not going to do it--my door is ajar--and the cat may
tip over the oil stove.No, just give it to me this way--so--so--many
happy returns, and may your boys--Where are the boys?Geert has gone to say good bye, and Barend has gone with Mees
to take the mattresses and chests in the yawl.They'll soon be here,
for they must be on board by three o'clock.There was a lot of everything and more too.The bride was
full,--three glasses "roses without thorns," two of "perfect love,"
and surely four glasses of "love in a mist."Where she stowed
it all I don't know.Give me the old fashioned dram, brandy and syrup--eh!He's come here to sleep--you look as if you hadn't been to
bed at all.In his bed--he, he, he!No, I say, don't take out your chew.No, you'd never guess how I got it.Less than ten
minutes ago I met Bos the ship-owner, and he gave me--he gave me a
little white roll--of--of tissue paper with tobacco inside.Yes, catch me smoking a thing like that in--in paper--that's a
chew with a shirt on.And you're a crosspatch without a shirt.No, I'm not going to
sit down.Day, Simon--shove in, room for you here.Give him just one, for a parting cup.Is there much work in the dry dock, Simon?No, if I sit down I stay too long.Well then, half a
glass--no--no cookies.It looks like all hands on deck
here!Uh--ja----

MARIETJE.The deuce, but you're touchy!We've got a quarter of an hour,
boys!Fallen asleep with a ginger nut in his hand.Sick in the night--afraid to call the matron; walked about
in his bare feet; got chilled.It's easy for you to talk, but if you disturb her, she keeps
you in for two weeks.Poor devils--I don't want to live to be so old.We're not even married
yet--and he's a widower already!I don't need a belaying pin----[Sings.]"Sailing, sailing, don't wait to be called;
    Starboard watch, spring from your bunk;
    Let the man at the wheel go to his rest;
    The rain is good and the wind is down.It's sailing, it's sailing,
    It's sailing for the starboard watch."[The others join him in beating time on the table with their fists.]You'll do the same when you're as old
as I am.You might have said that a while back when you
looked like a wet dish rag.Now we can make up a song about you, pasting paper
bags--just as Domela--he he he!My nevvy Geert pastes paper bags,
    Hi-ha, ho!My nevvy Geert----

SAART.DAAN., JO., MARIETJE AND COBUS.I'm blest if I see----

MARIETJE.They must--they must--not--not--that's fast.You must--you must----

MARIETJE.The ribs--and--and----[Firmly.]That's fast!----

GEERT, JO., COBUS, DAANTJE AND SAART.You went together to take the mattresses and chests----

MEES.Can't repeat a word of it--afraid--afraid--always afraid----[To
Marietje, who has induced her father to rise.]Now--now--Kneir, many happy returns.Perhaps he's saying good-bye to his girl.[Sound of Jelle's
fiddle outside.]Do sit still--one would think you'd eaten horse flesh.Poor old fellow, gets blinder every day.Yes, play that tune of--of--what do you call 'em?You know, Jelle, the one--that one that goes [Sings.]"I know
a song that charms the heart."Give us----[Jelle begins the Marseillaise.]"Alloose--vodela--bedeije--deboe--debie--de boolebie."That's the French of a dead codfish!I've laid in a French port--and say, it
was first rate!When I said pain they gave me bread--and when I said
"open the port," they opened the door.Let's use the
Dutch words we've got for it."Arise men, brothers, all united!Your wrongs, your sorrows be avenged"--

BOS.[Who has stood at the open window listening during the singing,
yells angrily.]It's high time you were all on board!Oh--Oh--how he scared me--he!I couldn't think where the voice came from.How stupid of you to roar like a weaned pig, when you know
Meneer Bos lives only two doors away.You'll never eat a sack of salt with him.What business had you to sing those low songs, anyway?If he
hadn't taken me by surprise!An old frog like that before your eyes
of a sudden.Ach, please don't, Geert.I'm afraid that if Meneer
Bos----[Motions to Jelle to stop.]This one is afraid to sail, this one of the Matron of the Old
Men's Home, this one of a little ship owner!Forbids me in my own
house!Commands me as though I were a servant!Fun is fun, but if you were a ship owner, you wouldn't want
your sailors singing like socialists either.When he knows how dependent I am, too.Is it an
honor to do his cleaning!For mopping the office floor and
licking his muddy boots you get fifty cents twice a week and the
scraps off their plates.Oh, what a row I'll get Saturday!If you hadn't all your
life allowed this braggart who began with nothing to walk over you
and treat you as a slave, while father and my brothers lost their
lives on the sea making money for him, you'd give him a scolding and
damn his hide for his insolence in opening his jaw.Next
year Mother will give you pennies to play."Arise men, brothers,
all unite-e-ed"----

KNEIR.Stop tormenting your old mother on her birthday.[Jelle
holds out his hand.]Here, you can't stand on one leg.I'll wait a few minutes for Barend.The
boys will come by here any way.Don't you catch on that those two are--A good voyage.Have I staid so long--and my door ajar![Brusquely coming through the kitchen door.]Skipper Hengst has my orders.[Cobus
and Daantje slink away, stopping outside to listen at the window.]Yes, Meneer, he is all ready to go.That other boy of yours that Hengst engaged--refuses to go.[They bow in a
scared way and hastily go on.]This looks like a dive--drunkenness
and rioting.Mother's birthday or not, we do as we please here.You change your tone or----

GEERT.Ach--dear Geert--Don't take offense, Meneer--he's
quick tempered, and in anger one says----

BOS.Dirt is all the thanks you get for
being good to you people.If you're not on board in
ten minutes, I'll send the police for you!You send--what do you take me for, any way!What I take him for--he asks that--dares to ask----[To
Kneirtje.]You'll come to me again recommending a trouble-maker kicked
out by the Navy.You
pay wages and I do the work.You're just a big overgrown boy, that's all!If it wasn't for Mother--I'd----

KNEIR.Kneir, Kneir,
consider well what you do--I gave you an advance in good faith----

KNEIR.Ach, yes, Meneer--Ach, yes----

BOS.Yes, Meneer--you and the priest----

BOS.One of your sons refuses to go, the other--you'll come to a bad
end, my little friend.On board I'm a sailor--I'm the skipper
here.A ship owner layin' down the law; don't do
this and don't do that!Boring his nose through the window when you
don't sing to suit him.For my part, sing, but a sensible sailor expecting to marry ought
to appreciate it when his employer is looking out for his good.You
young fellows have no respect for grey hairs.for grey hairs that
have become grey in want and misery----

BOS.Your mother's seen me, as child,
standing before the bait trays.I also have stood in an East wind
that froze your ears, biting off bait heads----

GEERT.We don't care for your stories, Meneer.You have
become a rich man, and a tyrant.Good!--you are perhaps no worse than
the rest, but don't interfere with me in my own house.We may all become different, and perhaps my son may
live to see the day when he will come, as I did, twelve years ago,
crying to the office, to ask if there's any news of his father and
his two brothers!and not find their employer sitting by his warm fire
and his strong box, drinking grog.He may not be damned for coming so
often to ask the same thing, nor be turned from the door with snubs
and the message, "When there's anything to tell you'll hear of it."You lie--I never did anything of the sort.I won't soil any more words over it.My father's hair was grey, my mother's hair is grey, Jelle,
the poor devil who can't find a place in the Old Men's Home because
on one occasion in his life he was light-fingered--Jelle has also
grey hairs.If you hear him or crooked
Jacob, it's the same cuckoo song.But
now I'll give another word of advice, my friend, before you go under
sail.You have an old mother, you expect to marry, good; you've been
in prison six months--I won't talk of that; you have barked out your
insolence to me in your own house, but if you attempt any of this
talk on board the Hope you'll find out there is a muster roll.When you've become older--and wiser--you'll be ashamed of your
insolence--"the ship owner by his warm stove, and his grog"----

GEERT.And his strong box----

BOS.And his cares, you haven't the wits to understand!Who hauls the fish out of the sea?Who
risks his life every hour of the day?Who doesn't take off his
clothes in five or six weeks?Who walks with hands covered with salt
sores,--without water to wash face or hands?Who sleep like beasts
two in a bunk?Who leave wives and mothers behind to beg alms?Twelve
head of us are presently going to sea--we get twenty-five per cent
of the catch, you seventy-five.We do the work, you sit safely at
home.Your ship is insured, and we--we can go to the bottom in case
of accident--we are not worth insuring----

KNEIR.You should be a clown in a
circus!Twenty-seven per cent isn't enough for him----

GEERT.I'll never eat salted codfish from your generosity!Our whole
share is in "profit and loss."When luck is with us we each make eight
guilders a week, one guilder a day when we're lucky.One guilder a
day at sea, to prepare salt fish, cod with livers for the people in
the cities--hahaha!--a guilder a day--when you're lucky and don't go
to the bottom.You fellows know what you're about when you engage us
on shares.[Old and young heads of fishermen appear at the window.]And say to the skipper--no, never mind--I'll
be there myself----[A pause.]Now I'll
take two minutes more, blockhead, to rub under your nose something
I tried three times to say, but you gave me no chance to get in a
word.When you lie in your bunk tonight--as a beast, of course!--try
and think of my risks, by a poor catch--lost nets and cordage--by
damages and lightning in the mast, by running aground, and God knows
what else.The Jacoba's just had her hatches torn off, the Queen
Wilhelmina half her bulwarks washed away.You don't count that,
for you don't have to pay for it!Three months ago the Expectation
collided with a steamer.Without a thought of the catch or the nets,
the men sprang overboard, leaving the ship to drift!You laugh, boy, because you don't realize what cares I
have.On the Mathilde last week the men smuggled gin and tobacco in
their mattresses to sell to the English.If you were talking about conditions in Middelharnis or Pernis,
you'd have reason for it.My men don't pay the harbor costs, don't
pay for bait, towing, provisions, barrels, salt.I don't expect you
to pay the loss of the cordage, if a gaff or a boom breaks.I go into
my own pocket for it.I gave your mother an advance, your brother
Barend deserts.No, Meneer, I can't believe that.Hengst telephoned me from the harbor, else I wouldn't have
been here to be insulted by your oldest son, who's disturbing the
whole neighborhood roaring his scandalous songs!If you're not on board on time I'll apply "Article
Sixteen" and fine you twenty-five guilders.As for you, my wife doesn't need you at
present, you're all a bad lot here.Ach, Meneer, it isn't my fault!After this voyage you can look for
another employer, who enjoys throwing pearls before swine better than
I do!Don't hang your head so soon, Aunt!Geert was in the right----

KNEIR.Great God, if he should desert--if he
deserts--he also goes to prison--two sons who----

GEERT.Aren't you going to wish me a good voyage--or don't you think
that necessary?Yes, I'm coming----

JO.I'm sorry for her, the poor thing.You gave him a
talking to, didn't you?[Picks a geranium from a flower
pot.]And you will
think of me every night, will you?Truus saw him hanging around the house.If that coward refuses to go,
your sitting at home won't help a damn.Don't forget your chewing tobacco
and your cigars----

GEERT.If you're too late--I'll never look at you again!I'll shout the whole village together if you don't
immediately run and follow Geert and Jo.If you can keep Geert from going--call him back!Have you gone crazy with fear, you big coward?The Good Hope is no good, no good--her ribs are
rotten--the planking is rotten!----

KNEIR.Don't stand there telling stories to excuse yourself.Simon, the ship carpenter--that drunken sot who can't speak
two words.First you sign, then you
run away!Me--you may beat me to death!--but I won't go on an unseaworthy
ship!Hasn't the ship been lying in the
dry docks?There was no caulking her any more--Simon----

KNEIR.March, take your package of
chewing tobacco.I'm not going--I'm not going.You don't know--you
didn't see it!The last voyage she had a foot of water in her hold!A ship that has just returned from her fourth
voyage to the herring catch and that has brought fourteen loads!Has
it suddenly become unseaworthy, because you, you miserable coward,
are going along?I looked in the hold--the barrels were
floating.You can see death that is hiding down there.Bilge water, as in every ship!Tell that
to your grandmother, not to an old sailor's wife.Skipper Hengst
is a child, eh!Isn't Hengst going and Mees and Gerrit and Jacob
and Nellis--your own brother and Truus' little Peter?Do you claim
to know more than old seamen?I'm not going to
stand it to see you taken aboard by the police----

BAR.Oh, Mother dear, Mother dear, don't make me go!Oh, God; how you have punished me in my children--my children
are driving me to beggary.I've taken an advance--Bos has refused to
give me any more cleaning to do--and--and----[Firmly.]Well, then,
let them come for you--you'd better be taken than run away.Oh, oh,
that this should happen in my family----

BAR.You'll not get out----

BAR.I don't know what I'm doing--I might hurt----

KNEIR.Now he is brave, against his sixty year old mother----Raise
your hand if you dare![Falls on a chair shaking his head between his hands.]Oh, oh,
oh--If they take me aboard, you'll never see me again--you'll never
see Geert again----

KNEIR.It's tempting God to rave this
way with fear----[Friendlier tone.]Come, a man of your age must
not cry like a child--come!I wanted to surprise you with Father's
earrings--come!Mother dear--I don't dare--I don't dare--I shall drown--hide
me--hide me----

KNEIR.If I believed a word of your talk,
would I let Geert go?There's a
package of tobacco, and one of cigars.Now sit still, and I'll put
in your earrings--look--[Talking as to a child.]--real silver--ships
on them with sails--sit still, now--there's one--there's two--walk
to the looking glass----

BAR.No--no!----

KNEIR.Come now, you're making me weak for nothing--please,
dear boy--I do love you and your brother--you're all I have on
earth.Every night I will pray to the good God to bring you
home safely.You must get used to it, then you will become a brave
seaman--and--and----[Cries.][Holds the
mirror before him.]Look at your earrings--what?----

1ST POLICEMAN.[Coming in through door at left, good-natured
manner.]Skipper Hengst has requested the Police----If you please,
my little man, we have no time to lose.The ship--is rotten----

2ND POLICEMAN.Then you should not have
mustered in.[Taps him kindly
on the shoulder.][Clings desperately to the
bedstead and door jamb.]I shall
drown in the dirty, stinking sea!Oh God, Oh
God, Oh God![Crawls up against the wall, beside himself with terror.]The boy is afraid----

1ST POLICEMAN.[Sobbing as she seizes Barend's hands.]Come now, boy--come
now--God will not forsake you----

BAR.[Moaning as he loosens his hold, sobs despairingly.]You'll
never see me again, never again----

1ST POLICEMAN.[They exeunt, dragging Barend.]Oh, oh----

TRUUS.What was the matter,
Kneir?Barend had to be taken by the police.Oh, and now
I'm ashamed to go walk through the village, to tell them good bye--the
disgrace--the disgrace----

                                CURTAIN.A lighted lamp--the illuminated
chimney gives a red glow.Kneirtje lying on bed, dressed, Jo reading
to her from prayerbook.]in piteousness,
      To your poor children of the sea,
    Reach down your arms in their distress;
      With God their intercessor be.Unto the Heart Divine your prayer
    Will make an end to all their care."[A
knock--she tiptoes to cook-shed door, puts her finger to her lips in
warning to Clementine and Kaps, who enter.]She's not herself yet,
feverish and coughing.I've brought her a plate of soup, and a half dozen
eggs.I've brought you some veal soup, Kneir.I'd like to see you carry a full pan with the sand blowing in
your eyes.There's five--and--[Looking at his hand, which drips with egg
yolk.][Bringing out his handkerchief and purse covered with egg.]He calls that putting them away
carefully.My purse, my handkerchief, my cork screw.I don't know why Father keeps that bookkeeper, deaf,
and cross.They haven't
forgotten the row with your sons yet.Mouth shut, or I'll get a
scolding.May Jo go to the beach with me to look at the sea?Go on the beach in such a
storm!I got a tap aft that struck the spot.The tree beside the pig stye was broken in two like a pipe stem.Did it come down on the pig stye?Uncle Cobus,
how do you come to be out, after eight o'clock, in this beastly
weather?The beans and pork gravy he ate----

CLEMENTINE.Beans and pork gravy for a sick old man?The matron broils him a chicken or a beefsteak--Eh?She's
even cross because she's got to beat an egg for his breakfast.This
afternoon he was delirious, talking of setting out the nets, and paying
out the buoy line.I sez to the matron, "His time's come.""Look out or
yours'll come," sez she.I sez, "The doctor should be sent for.""Mind
your own business," sez she, "am I the Matron or are you?"Then I
sez, "You're the matron."Just now, she sez,
"You'd better go for the doctor."As if it couldn't a been done this
afternoon.I go to the doctor and the doctor's out of town.Now I've
been to Simon to take me to town in his dog car.If drunken Simon drives, you're likely to roll off
the <DW18>.Must the doctor ride in the dog
car?Go on, now, tell us the rest.What I want to say is, that it's a blessing for Daantje he's
out of his head, 'fraid as he's always been of death.That's all in the way you look at it.If my time
should come tomorrow, then, I think, we must all!The waters of the sea
will not wash away that fact.On the fifth
day He created the Sea, great whales and the moving creatures that
abound therein, and said: "Be fruitful," and He blessed them.That
was evening and that was morning, that was the fifth day.And on the
sixth day He created man and said also: "Be fruitful," and blessed
them.That was again evening and again morning, that was the sixth
day.When I was on the herring
catch, or on the salting voyage, there were times when I didn't dare
use the cleaning knife.Because when you shove a herring's head
to the left with your thumb, and you lift out the gullet with the
blade, the creature looks at you with such knowing eyes, and yet
you clean two hundred in an hour.And when you cut throats out of
fourteen hundred cod, that makes twenty-eight hundred eyes that look
at you!I had few
equals in boning and cutting livers.Tja, tja, and how afraid they all
were!They looked up at the clouds as if they were saying:
"How about this now.I say:
we take the fish and God takes us.We must all, the beasts must,
and the men must, and because we all must, none of us should--now,
that's just as if you'd pour a full barrel into an empty one.I'd
be afraid to be left alone in the empty barrel, with every one else
in the other barrel.No, being afraid is no good; being afraid is
standing on your toes and looking over the edge.You act as if you'd had
a dram.Am I right about the pig
stye or not?Hear how the poor animal is going on out there.I'm sure
the wall has fallen in.You pour yourself out a bowl, Uncle Cobus!I'll give her a
helping hand.Cobus, I'll thank God when the Good Hope is safely in.But the Hope is an old ship,
and old ships are the last to go down.No, that's what every old sailor says.All the same, I shall pray
God tonight.But the Jacoba is out and the
Mathilda is out and the Expectation is out.The Good Hope is rotten--so--so----[Stops anxiously.]That's what----Why--that's what----I thought----It just
occurred to me.If the Good Hope was rotten, then your father would----

CLEMENTINE.Oh, shut your fool mouth, you'll make Kneir anxious.Quick,
Kneir, shut the door, for the lamp.How scared Barend will be, and just as
they're homeward bound.The evening is still so long and
so gloomy--Yes?[Enter Simon and Marietje, who is crying.]Stop your damn
howling----

KNEIRTJE.Her lover is also--be a good seaman's
wife.You girls haven't had any trouble
yet!If it wasn't for Daan----

JO.Here, this will warm you up, Simon.It's happened to me before
with the dog car, in a tempest like this.And when the
doctor came, Katrien was dead and the child was dead, but if you ask
me, I'd rather sit in my dog car tonight than to be on the sea.No, don't let us waste our time.Let's talk, then we won't
think of anything.Last night was stormy, too, and I had such a bad dream.I can't rightly say it was a dream.There was a rap on the
window, once.Soon as I lay down there came another rap, so.[Raps on
the table with her knuckles.]And then I saw Mees, his face was pale,
pale as--God!Each time--like that, so----[Raps.]You stupid, you, to scare the old woman into a fit with your
raps.My ears and neck full of sand, and it's
cold.Just throw a couple of blocks on the fire.I couldn't stand it at home either, children asleep, no one
to talk to, and the howling of the wind.Two mooring posts were
washed away.What's that to us----Milk and sugar?Your little son was a brave boy, Truus.I can see him
now as he stood waving good-bye.Yes, that boy's a treasure, barely twelve.You
should have seen him two and a half months ago.The child behaved like an angel, just like a grown
man.He would sit up evenings to chat with me, the child knows more
than I do.The lamb, hope he's not been awfully sea sick.Now, you may not believe it, but red spectacles
keep you from being sea sick.You're like the doctors, they let others swallow their doses.Many's the night I've slept on board; when my husband was
alive I went along on many a voyage.Should like to have seen you in oil skins.Hear, now, the young lady is flattering me.I'm not so bad
looking as that, Miss.Now and then, when things
didn't go to suit him, without speaking ill of the dead, I may say,
he couldn't keep his paws at home; then he'd smash things.I still
have a coffee pot without a handle I keep as a remembrance.--I wouldn't
part with it for a rix dollar.I won't even offer you a guilder!Say, you're such a funny story teller, tell us about the Harlemmer
oil, Saart.Yes, if it hadn't been for Harlemmer oil I might not have been
a widow.Now, then, my man was a comical chap.I'd bought him a knife in a leather sheath, paid a good price
for it too, and when he'd come back in five weeks and I'd ask him:
"Jacob, have you lost your knife?"he'd say, "I don't know about my
knife--you never gave me a knife."But
when he'd undress himself for the first time in five weeks, and pulled
off his rubber boots, bang, the knife would fall on the floor.He
hadn't felt it in all that time.Didn't take off his rubber boots in five weeks?Then I had to scrub 'im with soap and soda; he hadn't seen
water, and covered with vermin.Wish I could get a cent a dozen for all the lice on board;
they get them thrown in with their share of the cargo.Now
then, his last voyage a sheet of water threw him against the bulwarks
just as they pulled the mizzen staysail to larboard, and his leg was
broke.Then they were in a fix--The skipper could poultice and cut a
corn, but he couldn't mend a broken leg.Then they wanted to shove a
plank under it, but Jacob wanted Harlemmer oil rubbed on his leg.Every
day he had them rub it with Harlemmer oil, and again Harlemmer oil,
and some more Harlemmer oil.When they came in
his leg was a sight.You shouldn't have asked me to tell it.Now, yes; you can't bring the dead back to life.And when you
think of it, it's a dirty shame I can't marry again.A year later
the Changeable went down with man and mouse.Then, bless me, you'd
suppose, as your husband was dead, for he'd gone along with his leg
and a half, you could marry another man.First you must
advertise for him in the newspapers three times, and then if in three
times he don't turn up, you may go and get a new license.I don't think I'll ever marry again.That's not surprisin' when you've been married twice already;
if you don't know the men by this time.I wish I could talk about things the way you do.With my first it was a horror; with my second you know
yourselves.I could sit up all night hearing tales of
the sea.Don't tell stories of suffering and death----

SAART.[Quietly knitting and speaking in a toneless voice.]Ach,
it couldn't have happened here, Kneir.We lived in Vlaardingen then,
and I'd been married a year without any children.No, Pietje was Ari's
child--and he went away on the Magnet.And you understand what happened;
else I wouldn't have got acquainted with Ari and be living next door
to you now.The Magnet stayed on the sands or some other place.But
I didn't know that then, and so didn't think of it.Now in Vlaardingen they have a tower and on the tower a lookout.And this lookout hoists a red ball when he sees a lugger or
a trawler or other boat in the distance.And when he sees who it
is, he lets down the ball, runs to the ship owner and the families
to warn them; that's to say: the Albert Koster or the Good Hope is
coming.Now mostly he's no need to warn the family.For, as soon as
the ball is hoisted in the tower, the children run in the streets
shouting, I did it, too, as a child: "The ball is up!Then the women run, and wait below for the lookout to come down,
and when it's their ship they give him pennies.And--and--the Magnet with my first
husband, didn't I say I'd been married a year?The Magnet stayed out
seven weeks--with provisions for six--and each time the children
shouted: "The ball is up, Truus!Then I
ran like mad to the tower.They all knew why
I ran, and when the lookout came down I could have torn the words
out of his mouth.But I would say: "Have you tidings--tidings of
the Magnet?"Then he'd say: "No, it's the Maria," or the Alert,
or the Concordia, and then I'd drag myself away slowly, so slowly,
crying and thinking of my husband.And each day, when
the children shouted, I got a shock through my brain, and each day I
stood by the tower, praying that God--but the Magnet did not come--did
not come.At the last I didn't dare to go to the tower any more when
the ball was hoisted.No longer dared to stand at the door waiting,
if perhaps the lookout himself would bring the message.That lasted
two months--two months--and then--well, then I believed it.Now, that's so short a time since.Ach, child, I'd love to talk about it to every
one, all day long.When you've been left with six children--a good
man--never gave me a harsh word--never.Had it happened six
days later they would have brought him in.They smell when there's
a corpse aboard.Yes, that's true, you never see them otherwise.You'll never marry a fisherman, Miss; but it's sad,
sad; God, so sad!when they lash your dear one to a plank, wrapped in
a piece of sail with a stone in it, three times around the big mast,
and then, one, two, three, in God's name.No, I wasn't thinking of Mees, I was thinking of my little
brother, who was also drowned.Wasn't that on the herring catch?His second voyage, a blow
from the fore sail, and he lay overboard.The
skipper reached him the herring shovel, but it was smooth and it
slipped from his hands.Then Jerusalem, the mate, held out the broom
to him--again he grabbed hold.The three of them pulled him up; then
the broom gave way, he fell back into the waves, and for the third
time the skipper threw him a line.God wanted my little brother, the
line broke, and the end went down with him to the bottom of the sea.frightful!--Grabbed it three times, and lost
it three times.As if the child knew what was coming in the morning, he had
lain crying all night.Crying for Mother, who was
sick.When the skipper tried to console him, he said: "No, skipper,
even if Mother does get well, I eat my last herring today."No, truly, Miss, when he came back from Pieterse's with the
money, Toontje's share of the cargo as rope caster, eighteen guilders
and thirty-five cents for five and a half weeks.Then he simply acted
insane, he threw the money on the ground, then he cursed at--I won't
repeat what--at everything.Mother's sickness and burial
had cost a lot.Eighteen guilders is a heap of money, a big heap.Eighteen guilders for your child, eighteen--[Listening in alarm
to the blasts of the wind.]No, say, Hahaha!----

KNEIRTJE.Yes, yes, if the water could
only speak.Come now, you tell a tale of the sea.Ach, Miss, life on the sea is no tale.Nothing
between yourself and eternity but the thickness of a one-inch
plank.It's hard on the men, and hard on the women.Yesterday I passed
by the garden of the Burgomaster.They sat at table and ate cod from
which the steam was rising, and the children sat with folded hands
saying grace.Then, thought I, in my ignorance--if it was wrong, may
God forgive me--that it wasn't right of the Burgomaster--not right
of him--and not right of the others.For the wind blew so hard out
of the East, and those fish came out of the same water in which our
dead--how shall I say it?--in which our dead--you understand me.It is our living,
and we must not rebel against our living.When the lead was dropped he could tell by the taste of the
sand where they were.Often in the night he'd say we are on the 56th
and on the 56th they'd be.Once
he drifted about two days and nights in a boat with two others.That
was the time they were taking in the net and a fog came up so thick
they couldn't see the buoys, let alone find the lugger.Later when the boat went to pieces--you should
have heard him tell it--how he and old Dirk swam to an overturned
rowboat; he climbed on top."I'll never forget that night," said
he.Dirk was too old or tired to get a hold.Then my husband stuck
his knife into the boat.Dirk tried to grasp it as he was sinking,
and he clutched in such a way that three of his fingers hung
down.Then at the risk of his own life,
my husband pulled Dirk up onto the overturned boat.So the two of
them drifted in the night, and Dirk--old Dirk--from loss of blood
or from fear, went insane.He sat and glared at my husband with the
eyes of a cat.He raved of the devil that was in him.Of Satan, and
the blood, my husband said, ran all over the boat--the waves were
kept busy washing it away.Just at dawn Dirk slipped off, insane
as he was.My man was picked up by a freighter that sailed by.But
it was no use, three years later--that's twelve years ago now--the
Clementine--named after you by your father--stranded on the Doggerbanks
with him and my two oldest.Of what happened to them, I know nothing,
nothing at all.Never a buoy, or a hatch, washed ashore.You can't realize it at first, but after so many years one
can't recall their faces any more, and that's a blessing.For hard it
would be if one remembered.Every sailor's
wife has something like this in her family, it's not new.Truus is
right: "The fish are dearly paid for."We are all in God's hands, and God is great and good.[Beating her
head with her fists.]You're all driving me mad, mad, mad!Her husband and her little brother--and my poor
uncle--those horrible stories--instead of cheering us up!My father was drowned, drowned, drowned,
drowned!There are others--all--drowned, drowned!--and--you are all
miserable wretches--you are![Violently bangs the door shut as she
runs out.]No, child, she will quiet down by herself.Nervous strain
of the last two days.It has grown late, Kneir, and your niece--your niece was a
little unmannerly.Thank you again, Miss, for the soup and eggs.Are you coming to drink a bowl with me tomorrow night?If you see Jo send her in at once.[All go out except
Kneirtje.A fierce wind howls, shrieking
about the house.She listens anxiously at the window, shoves her
chair close to the chimney, stares into the fire.Her lips move in
a muttered prayer while she fingers a rosary.Jo enters, drops into
a chair by the window and nervously unpins her shawl.]And that dear child that came out in the storm to bring me
soup and eggs.Your sons are out in the storm for her and her father.Half the guard
rail is washed away, the pier is under water.You never went on like this
when Geert sailed with the Navy.In a month or two
it will storm again; each time again.And there are many fishermen on
the sea besides our boys.[Her speech sinks into a soft murmur.Her
old fingers handle the rosary.]Barend, we almost drove him away![Seeing that Kneirtje prays, she walks to the window wringing
her hands, pulls up the curtain uncertainly, stares through the window
panes.The wind blows the
curtain on high, the lamp dances, the light puffs out.oh!----

KNEIRTJE.[Jo
lights the lamp, shivering with fear.][To Jo,
who crouches sobbing by the chimney.]If anything happens--then--then----

KNEIRTJE.Now, I ask you, how will it be when you're married?You don't know
what you say, Aunt Kneir!If Geert--[Stops, panting.]That was not
good of you--not good--to have secrets.Your lover--your husband--is
my son.Don't stare that way into the
fire.Even if
it was wrong of you and of him.Come and sit opposite to me, then
together we will--[Lays her prayerbook on the table.]If anything happens----

KNEIRTJE.If anything--anything--anything--then I'll never pray
again, never again.No Mother Mary--then there
is nothing--nothing----

KNEIRTJE.[Opens the prayerbook, touches Jo's arm.Jo looks up, sobbing
passionately, sees the prayerbook, shakes her head fiercely.Again
wailing, drops to the floor, which she beats with her hands.Kneirtje's
trembling voice sounds.][The wind races with wild lashings about the house.]Left, office door, separated from the
main office by a wooden railing.Between this door and railing are
two benches; an old cupboard.In the background; three windows with
view of the sunlit sea.In front of the middle window a standing
desk and high stool.Right, writing table with telephone--a safe,
an inside door.On the walls, notices of wreckage, insurance, maps,
etc.[Kaps, Bos and Mathilde discovered.]Clemens!----

KAPS.: 2,447 ribs, marked Kusta; ten sail sheets, marked 'M."Four deck beams, two spars, five"----

MATHILDE.I have written the circular for the tower
bell.Connect me with the
Burgomaster!Up to my ears
in--[Sweetly.]My little wife asks----

MATHILDE.If Mevrouw will come to the telephone about the circular.If Mevrouw
will come to the telephone a moment?Just so, Burgomaster,--the
ladies--hahaha!Then it can go to the
printers.Do you think I
haven't anything on my mind!That damned----

MATHILDE.No,
she can't come to the telephone herself, she doesn't know
how.My wife has written the circular for
the tower bell."You are no doubt acquainted with the new church."--She
says, "No," the stupid!I am reading, Mevrouw, again."You are no
doubt acquainted with the new church.The church has, as you know,
a high tower; that high tower points upward, and that is good, that is
fortunate, and truly necessary for many children of our generation"----

MATHILDE.Pardon, I was speaking to
my bookkeeper.Yes--yes--ha, ha, ha--[Reads again
from paper.]"But that tower could do something else that also is
good.It can mark the time for us children of the
times.It stands there since 1882 and has never
answered to the question, 'What time is it?'It
was indeed built for it, there are four places visible for faces;
for years in all sorts of ways"--Did you say anything?No?--"for years
the wish has been expressed by the surrounding inhabitants that they
might have a clock--About three hundred guilders are needed.The Committee, Mevrouw"--What did you say?Yes, you know the
names, of course.Yes--Yes--All the ladies of
the Committee naturally sign for the same amount, a hundred guilders
each?Yes--Yes--Very well--My wife will be at home, Mevrouw.Damned nonsense!--a hundred guilders gone to the devil!What
is it to you if there's a clock on the damn thing or not?I'll let you fry in your own fat.She'll be here in her carriage in quarter of an hour.If you drank less grog in the evenings
you wouldn't have such a bad temper in the mornings.You took five guilders out of my purse this morning
while I was asleep.I can keep no----

MATHILDE.Bah, what a man, who counts his money before he goes to bed!Very well, don't give it--Then I can treat the Burgomaster's
wife to a glass of gin presently--three jugs of old gin and not a
single bottle of port or sherry![Bos angrily throws down two rix
dollars.]If it wasn't for me you wouldn't
be throwing rix dollars around!--Bah!IJmuiden, 24 December--Today there were four sloops
in the market with 500 to 800 live and 1,500 to 2,100 dead haddock
and some--live cod--The live cod brought 7 1/4--the dead----

BOS.The dead haddock brought thirteen and a half guilders a basket.Take
your book--turn to the credit page of the Expectation----

KAPS.no--the Good Hope?--We can whistle for her.Fourteen hundred and forty-three guilders and forty-seven cents.How could you be so ungodly stupid, to deduct four
guilders, 88, for the widows and orphans' fund?--1,443--3 per cent off--that's
1,400--that's gross three hundred and 87 guilders--yes, it should be
three guilders, 88, instead of four, 88.If you're going into your dotage, Jackass!There might be something to say against
that, Meneer--you didn't go after me when, when----

BOS.Now, that'll do, that'll do!----

KAPS.And that was an error with a couple of big ciphers after it.[Bos
goes off impatiently at right.]It all depends on what side----

[Looks around, sees Bos is gone, pokes up the fire; fills his pipe from
Bos's tobacco jar, carefully steals a couple of cigars from his box.]Mynheer Bos, eh?--no.Meneer said
that when he got news, he----

SIMON.The Jacoba came in after fifty-nine days' lost time.You are--You know more than you let on.Then it's time--I know more, eh?I'm holding off the ships by
ropes, eh?I warned you folks when that ship lay in the docks.What were
the words I spoke then, eh?All tales on your part for a glass
of gin!You was there, and the Miss was there.I says,
"The ship is rotten, that caulking was damn useless.That a floating
coffin like that"----

KAPS.Are
you so clever that when you're half drunk----

SIMON.Not drunk then, are you such an authority, you a shipmaster's
assistant, that when you say "no," and the owner and the Insurance
Company say "yes," my employer must put his ship in the dry docks?And now, I say--now, I say--that
if Mees, my daughter's betrothed, not to speak of the others, if
Mees--there will be murder.I'll be back in ten
minutes.[Goes back to his desk; the telephone rings.Mynheer
will be back in ten minutes.Mynheer Bos just went round the
corner.How lucky that outside of the children there were three
unmarried men on board.Or you'll break Meneer's
cigars.Kaps, do you want to make a guilder?I'm engaged to Bol, the skipper.He's lying here, with a load of peat for the city.I can't; because they don't know if my husband's dead.The legal limit is----

SAART.You must summons him, 'pro Deo,' three times in the papers and
if he doesn't come then, and that he'll not do, for there aren't any
more ghosts in the world, then you can----

SAART.Now, if you'd attend to this little matter, Bol and I would
always be grateful to you.When your common sense tells you
I haven't seen Jacob in three years and the----

[Cobus enters, trembling with agitation.]There must be tidings of the boys--of--of--the
Hope.Now, there is no use in your coming
to this office day after day.I haven't any good news to give you,
the bad you already know.Sixty-two days----

COB.Ach, ach, ach; Meneer Kaps,
help us out of this uncertainty.My sister--and my niece--are simply
insane with grief.My niece is sitting alone at home--my sister is at the Priest's,
cleaning house.There must be something--there must be something.The water bailiff's clerk said--said--Ach, dear God----[Off.]after that storm--all things
are possible.No, I wouldn't give a cent for it.If they had run into an English harbor, we would have
had tidings.[Laying her sketch book on Kaps's desk.]That's the way he was three months ago,
hale and jolly.No, Miss, I haven't the time.Daantje's death was a blow to him--you always saw them together,
always discussing.Now he hasn't a friend in the "Home"; that makes
a big difference.Well, that's Kneir, that's Barend with the basket on his back,
and that's--[The telephone bell rings.How long
will he be, Kaps?A hatch marked
47--and--[Trembling.][Screams and lets the
receiver fall.]I don't dare listen--Oh, oh!Barend?----Barend?----

CLEMENTINE.A telegram from Nieuwediep.A hatch--and a corpse----

[Enter Bos.]The water bailiff is on the 'phone.The water bailiff?--Step aside--Go along, you!I--I--[Goes timidly off.]A
telegram from Nieuwediep?47?--Well,
that's damned--miserable--that!the corpse--advanced stage of
decomposition!Barend--mustered in as oldest boy!by--oh!--The Expectation has come into Nieuwediep disabled?And
did Skipper Maatsuiker recognize him?So it isn't necessary to send any
one from here for the identification?Yes, damned sad--yes--yes--we
are in God's hand--Yes--yes--I no longer had any doubts--thank
you--yes--I'd like to get the official report as soon as possible.I
will inform the underwriters, bejour!I
never expected to hear of the ship again.Yes--yes--yes--yes--[To Clementine.]What stupidity to repeat what you heard in that woman's
presence.It won't be five minutes now till half the village is
here!You sit there, God save me, and take
on as if your lover was aboard----

CLEMENTINE.When Simon, the shipbuilder's assistant----

BOS.And if he hadn't been, what right have you to stick
your nose into matters you don't understand?Dear God, now I am also guilty----

BOS.Have the novels you read gone to
your head?Are you possessed, to use those words after such
an accident?He said that the ship was a floating coffin.Then I heard
you say that in any case it would be the last voyage for the Hope.That damned boarding school; those damned
boarding school fads!Walk if you like through the village like a fool,
sketching the first rascal or beggar you meet!But don't blab out
things you can be held to account for.Say, rather,
a drunken authority--The North, of Pieterse, and the Surprise and the
Willem III and the Young John.Half of the
fishing fleet and half the merchant fleet are floating coffins.No, Meneer, I don't hear anything.If you had asked me: "Father, how is this?"But you conceited young people meddle with everything and
more, too!What stronger proof is there than the yearly inspection of
the ships by the underwriters?Do you suppose that when I presently
ring up the underwriter and say to him, "Meneer, you can plank down
fourteen hundred guilders"--that he does that on loose grounds?You
ought to have a face as red as a buoy in shame for the way you flapped
out your nonsense!Nonsense; that might take away
my good name, if I wasn't so well known.If I were a ship owner--and I heard----

BOS.God preserve the fishery from an owner who makes drawings and
cries over pretty vases!I stand as a father at the head of a hundred
homes.When you get sensitive you go head over
heels.[Kaps makes a motion that he cannot hear.]The Burgomaster's wife is making a call.Willem Hengst, aged
thirty-seven, married, four children----

BOS.Wait a moment till my daughter----

CLEMENTINE.Jacob Zwart, aged thirty-five years, married,
three children.Gerrit Plas, aged twenty-five years, married, one
child.Geert Vermeer, unmarried, aged twenty-six years.Nellis Boom,
aged thirty-five years, married, seven children.Klaas Steen, aged
twenty-four years, married.Solomon Bergen, aged twenty-five years,
married, one child.Mari Stad, aged forty-five years, married.Barend Vermeer,
aged nineteen years.Pietje Stappers, aged twelve years.Ach, God; don't make me unhappy, Meneer!----

BOS.Stappers----

MARIETJE.You lie!--It isn't
possible!----

BOS.The Burgomaster at Nieuwediep has telegraphed the water
bailiff.Barend Vermeer was washed ashore.You know what that means,
and a hatch of the 47----

TRUUS.Oh, Mother Mary, must I lose that child, too?Oh,
oh, oh, oh!--Pietje--Pietje----

MARIETJE.Then--Then--[Bursts into a hysterical
laugh.]Hahaha!--Hahaha!----

BOS.[Striking the glass from Clementine's hand.][Falling on her knees, her hands catching hold of the railing
gate.]Let me die!--Let me die, please, dear God, dear God!Come Marietje, be calm; get up.And so brave; as he stood there, waving,
when the ship--[Sobs loudly.]There hasn't
been a storm like that in years.Think of Hengst with four children,
and Jacob and Gerrit--And, although it's no consolation, I will hand
you your boy's wages today, if you like.Both of you go home now and
resign yourselves to the inevitable--take her with you--she seems----

MARIETJE.I want to
die, die----

CLEMENTINE.Cry, Marietje, cry, poor lamb----

[They go off.]Are
you too lazy to put pen to paper today?Have you
the Widows' and Orphans' fund at hand?[Bos
throws him the keys.][Opens the safe, shuffles back
to Bos's desk with the book.]Ninety-five widows, fourteen old sailors and fishermen.Yes, the fund fell short some time ago.We will have to put in
another appeal.The Burgomaster's
wife asks if you will come in for a moment.Kaps, here is the copy for the circular.Talk to her about making a public appeal for the unfortunates.Yes, but, Clemens, isn't that overdoing it, two begging
parties?I will do it myself, then--[Both exit.][Goes to his desk
and sits down opposite to him.]I feel so miserable----

KAPS.The statement of
Veritas for October--October alone; lost, 105 sailing vessels and
30 steamships--that's a low estimate; fifteen hundred dead in one
month.Yes, when you see it as it appears
today, so smooth, with the floating gulls, you wouldn't believe that
it murders so many people.[To Jo and Cobus, who sit alone in a dazed way.]We have just run from home--for Saart just as I
said--just as I said----

[Enter Bos.]You stay
where you are, Cobus.You have no doubt heard?----

JO.It happens so often that
they get off in row boats.Not only was there a hatch,
but the corpse was in an extreme state of dissolution.Skipper Maatsuiker of the Expectation identified him, and the
earrings.And if--he should be mistaken----I've
come to ask you for money, Meneer, so I can go to the Helder myself.The Burgomaster of Nieuwediep will take care of that----

[Enter Simon.]I--I--heard----[Makes a strong gesture towards Bos.]I--I--have no evil
intentions----

BOS.Must that drunken
fellow----

SIMON.[Steadying himself by holding to the gate.]No--stay where
you are--I'm going--I--I--only wanted to say how nicely it came
out--with--with--The Good Hope.Don't come so close to me--never come so close to a man with
a knife----No-o-o-o--I have no bad intentions.I only wanted to say,
that I warned you--when--she lay in the docks.Now just for the joke of it--you ask--ask--ask your bookkeeper
and your daughter--who were there----

BOS.You're not worth an answer, you sot!My employer--doesn't do the caulking himself.[To Kaps, who
has advanced to the gate.]Didn't I warn him?--wasn't you there?No, I wasn't there, and even if I
was, I didn't hear anything.Did that drunken sot----

CLEMENTINE.As my daughter do you permit----[Grimly.]I don't remember----

SIMON.That's low--that's low--damned low!I said, the ship was
rotten--rotten----

BOS.You're trying to drag in my bookkeeper
and daughter, and you hear----

COB.Yes, but--yes, but--now I remember also----

BOS.But your daughter--your daughter
says now that she hadn't heard the ship was rotten.And on the second
night of the storm, when she was alone with me at my sister Kneirtje's,
she did say that--that----

CLEMENTINE.Did I--say----

COB.These are my own words
to you: "Now you are fibbing, Miss; for if your father knew the Good
Hope was rotten"----

JO.[Springing up wildly, speaking with piercing distinctness.]I
was there, and Truus was there, and----Oh, you adders!Who
gives you your feed, year in, year out?Haven't you decency enough to
believe us instead of that drunken beggar who reels as he stands there?You had Barend dragged on board by the police; Geert was too
proud to be taken!No,
no, you needn't point to your door!If I staid here
any longer I would spit in your face--spit in your face!For your Aunt's sake I will consider that you
are overwrought; otherwise--otherwise----The Good Hope was seaworthy,
was seaworthy!And even
had the fellow warned me--which is a lie, could I, a business man,
take the word of a drunkard who can no longer get a job because he
is unable to handle tools?I--I told you and him and her--that a floating
coffin like that.Geert and Barend and Mees and the
others![Sinks on the chair
sobbing.]Give me the money to go to Nieuwediep myself, then I won't
speak of it any more.A girl that talks to me as
rudely as you did----

JO.I don't know what I said--and--and--I don't
believe that you--that you--that you would be worse than the devil.The water-bailiff says that it isn't necessary to send any one
to Nieuwediep.What will
become of me now?----

[Cobus and Simon follow her out.]And you--don't you ever dare to set foot again
in my office.Father, I ask myself [Bursts into sobs.]She would be capable of ruining my good name--with
her boarding-school whims.Who ever comes now you send away,
understand?[Sound of Jelle's fiddle
outside.][Falls into his chair, takes
up Clementine's sketch book; spitefully turns the leaves; throws
it on the floor; stoops, jerks out a couple of leaves, tears them
up.Sits in thought a moment, then rings the telephone.]with
Dirksen--Dirksen, I say, the underwriter![Waits, looking
sombre.]It's all up with the
Good Hope.A hatch with my mark washed ashore and the body of a
sailor.I shall wait for you here at my office.[Rings off;
at the last words Kneirtje has entered.]I----[She sinks on the bench, patiently weeping.]Have you mislaid the
policies?You never put a damn thing in its place.The policies are higher, behind
the stocks.[Turning around
with the policies in his hand.]That hussy that
lives with you has been in here kicking up such a scandal that I came
near telephoning for the police.Is it true--is it true
that----The priest said----[Bos nods with a sombre expression.]Oh,
oh----[She stares helplessly, her arms hang limp.]I know you as a respectable woman--and
your husband too.I'm sorry to have to say it to you
now after such a blow, your children and that niece of yours have never
been any good.[Kneirtje's head sinks down.]How many years haven't
we had you around, until your son Geert threatened me with his fists,
mocked my grey hairs, and all but threw me out of your house--and your
other son----[Frightened.]Shall I call Mevrouw or your daughter?with long drawn out sobs,
sits looking before her with a dazed stare.][In an agonized voice, broken with sobs.]And with my own hands I loosened his
fingers from the door post.You have no cause to reproach yourself----

KNEIRTJE.Before he went I hung his
father's rings in his ears.Like--like a lamb to the slaughter----

BOS.Come----

KNEIRTJE.And my oldest boy that I didn't bid good
bye----"If you're too late"--these were his words--"I'll never look
at you again."in God's name, stop!----

KNEIRTJE.Twelve years ago--when the Clementine--I sat here as I am
now.[Sobs with her face between her trembling old hands.]Ach, poor, dear Kneir, I am so sorry for you.My husband and four sons----

MATHILDE.We have written an
appeal, the Burgomaster's wife and I, and it's going to be in all
the papers tomorrow.Here, Kaps----[Hands Kaps a sheet of paper which
he places on desk--Bos motions to her to go.]Let her wait a while,
Clemens.I have a couple of cold chops--that will brace
her up--and--and--let's make up with her.You have no objections
to her coming again to do the cleaning?We won't forget you, do you
hear?Now, my only hope is--my niece's child.She is with child by my
son----[Softly smiling.]No, that isn't a misfortune
now----

BOS.This immorality under your own
roof?Don't you know the rules of the fund, that no aid can be
extended to anyone leading an immoral life, or whose conduct does
not meet with our approval?I leave it to the gentlemen
themselves--to do for me--the gentlemen----

BOS.It will be a tussle with the Committee--the committee of the
fund--your son had been in prison and sang revolutionary songs.And
your niece who----However, I will do my best.I shall recommend
you, but I can't promise anything.There are seven new families,
awaiting aid, sixteen new orphans.My wife wants to give you something to take home
with you.[The bookkeeper rises, disappears
for a moment, and returns with a dish and an enamelled pan.]If you will return the dish when it's convenient,
and if you'll come again Saturday, to do the cleaning.He closes her nerveless hands about the dish and pan;
shuffles back to his stool.Kneirtje sits motionless,
in dazed agony; mumbles--moves her lips--rises with difficulty,
stumbles out of the office.]Appeal, for the
newspapers![Smiling sardonically, he comes to the foreground; leaning
on Bos's desk, he reads.]"Benevolent Fellow Countrymen: Again we
urge upon your generosity an appeal in behalf of a number of destitute
widows and orphans.The lugger Good Hope----[As he continues reading.]End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Good Hope, by Herman Heijermans, Jr.Agony, pure and simple, was the only sensation it produced.When they struck up, we just ran away till the tune was ended--what
tune, familiar or unfamiliar, it was impossible to say.Between us
three, all blessed, or cursed, with musical ears, there existed such
difference of opinion on this head, that decision became vain.And
when at last, as the hour of service approached, little groups began
strolling towards the church, the musicians began a final "God save the
Queen," barely recognisable, a feeling of thankfulness was the only
sensation left.[Illustration: THE FISHERMAN'S DAUGHTER--A CORNISH STUDY.]Now, let me not be hard upon these village Orpheuses.They did their
best, and for a working man to study music in any form is a good and
desirable thing.But whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing
well.The great bane of provincial life is that people have so few
opportunities of finding out when they do _not_ do things well, and so
little ambition to learn to do them better.If these few severe remarks
should spur on that anonymous band to try and emulate the Philharmonic
or the Crystal Palace orchestra, it will be all the better for the
little community at the Lizard.A crowded congregation--not a
seat vacant--listened to the excellent chanting, hymns, and a harvest
anthem, most accurately and correctly sung.The organist too--it was
a pleasure to watch that young man's face and see with what interest
and enthusiasm he entered into it all.Besides the rector, there were
several other clergymen, one of whom, an old man, read the prayers
with an intonation and expression which I have rarely heard equalled,
and another preached what would have been called anywhere a thoroughly
good sermon.All the statelier guests at the Rectory tea--probably
county families (one stout lady had the dignity of a duchess at
least)--"assisted" at this evening service, and behind them was a
throng of humbler folk, among whom we recognised our sole friend here,
John Curgenven.We had passed him at the church door, and he had lifted
his hat with the air of a _preux chevalier_ of the olden time; "more
like King Arthur than ever"--we observed to one another.He, and we, and the aristocratic groups, with a few more of the
congregation, lingered for several minutes after service was over,
admiring the beautiful flowers and fruit.I think I never saw any
decorations so rich or so tasteful.And then, as the organ played us
out with an exceedingly brilliant voluntary, the vision of light and
colour melted away, and we came out upon the quiet churchyard, lying in
the cold, still moonlight.Clear as day, the round silver orb sailing
through a cloudless sky of that deep dark which we know is blue, only
moonlight shows no colours.Oh, Lady Moon, Lady Moon, what a dangerous
night for some of those groups to go walking home in!We saw them in
twos and threes, various young people whom we had got to know by sight,
and criticise, and take an interest in, wandering slowly on through
Lizard Town, and then diverging into quieter paths.For there, in an open space near the two hotels
which co-exist close together--I hope amicably, and divide the tourist
custom of the place--in front of a row of open windows which showed the
remains of a _table d'hote_, and playing lively tunes to a group of
delighted listeners, including some children, who had struck up a merry
dance--stood that terrible wind band!All our sympathy with our fellow-creatures, our
pleasure in watching them enjoy themselves, our interest in studying
human nature in the abstract, nay, even the picturesqueness of the
charming moonlight scene, could not tempt us to stay.We paused a
minute, then put our fingers in our ears and fled.Gradually those
fearful sounds melted away into distance, and left us to the silence of
moonshine, and the sight, now grown familiar, but never less beautiful,
of the far-gleaming Lizard Lights.DAY THE SEVENTH


John Curgenven had said last night, with his air of tender patronising,
half regal, half paternal, which we declared always reminded us of King
Arthur--"Ladies, whenever you settle to go to Kynance, I'll take you."And sure enough there he stood, at eight in the morning, quite a
picture, his cap in one hand, a couple of fishes dangling from the
other--he had brought them as a present, and absolutely refused to be
paid--smiling upon us at our breakfast, as benignly as did the sun.He
came to say that he was at our service till 10 A.M.We did not like venturing in strange and
dangerous ground, or rather sea, without our protector.But this was
our last chance, and such a lovely day."You won't come to any harm, ladies," said the consoling John."I'll
take you by a short cut across the down, much better than the cliff.You can't possibly miss your way: it'll lead you straight to Kynance,
and then you go down a steep path to the Cove.You'll have plenty of
time before the tide comes in to see everything.""Oh yes, miss, there's the Drawing-room, the Dining-room, and the
Kitchen--all capital caves close together; I wouldn't advise you to
swim out far, though.And keep a sharp look out for the tide--it runs
in pretty fast.""Oh, you can easy get on Asparagus Island, miss; it's quite safe.Only
don't try the Devil's Throat--or Hell's Mouth, as some folk call it."Neither name was inviting; but studying our guide-books, we thought we
could manage even without our friend.So, long ere the dew was dried on
the sunshiny down, we all started off together, Curgenven slackening
his quick active steps--very light and most enviably active for a man
of his years--to accommodate us, and conversing courteously with us all
the way.[Illustration: KYNANCE COVE, CORNWALL.]"Ower the muir amang the heather" have I tramped many a mile in
bonnie Scotland, but this Cornish moor and Cornish heather were quite
different.As different as the Cornishman with his bright, frank face,
and his mixture of British honesty and Gallic courtesy, from the Scotch
peasant--equally worthy, but sometimes just a trifle "dour."John had plenty to say for himself, and said it well, with a quiet
independence that there was no mistaking; never forgetting meanwhile to
stop and offer a helping hand over every bit of rough road, puddle, or
bog.He gave us a vivid picture of winter life at the Lizard: when the
little community has to hybernate, like the squirrels and field-mice,
upon its summer savings."Sometimes we don't earn a halfpenny for weeks and months, and then if
we've got nothing to fall back upon it's a bad job, you see, ma'am."I asked him if much money went for drink; they seemed to me a
remarkably sober set at the Lizard."Yes, I think we are; we're obliged to be; we can't spend money at the
public-house, for we've got none to spend.I'm no teetotaller myself,"
added John boldly."I don't dislike a glass of beer now and then, if I
can afford it, and when I can't afford it I can do without it, and if I
do take it I always know when to stop."Ay, that is the crucial test--the knowing when to stop.It is this
which makes all the difference between a good man and a villain, a wise
man and a fool.Self-control--a quality which, guided by conscience and
common sense, is the best possession of any human being.And looking at
the honest fisherman, one felt pretty sure he had his share of it."Now I must leave you, ladies," said he, a great deal sooner than we
wished, for we much liked talking to him."My time's nearly up, and I
mustn't keep my gentleman waiting; he goes out in my boat every day,
and has been a good friend to me.The road's straight before you,
ladies; and there's another party just ahead of you.Follow the track,
and you'll soon be at Kynance.It's a lovely day for the Cove, and I
hope you'll enjoy yourselves."John bared his grey head, with a salutation worthy of some old knight
of the Round Table, and then strode back, in double-quick time, as
active and upright as any young fellow of twenty-five, across the level
down.When, afterwards, I stood one dull winter day
in a London Art Gallery, opposite the _Cornish Lions_, how well I
recalled this day!How truly Brett's picture gives the long roll of
the wave upon the silver sands, the richly-tinted rocks and caves, the
brightness and freshness of everything.And those merry girls beside
me, who had the faculty of enjoying all they had, and all they did,
without regretting what they had not or what they might not do--with
heroic resignation they promised not to attempt to swim in the tempting
smooth water beyond the long rollers.Though knocked down again and
again, they always emerged from the waves with shouts of laughter.Mere
dots they looked to my anxious eyes--a couple of corks tossed hither
and thither on the foaming billows--and very thankful I was to get them
safe back into the "drawing-room," the loveliest of lovely caves.There was no time to lose; by noon our parlour floor--what a fairy
floor it was!of the softest, most delicious sand--would be all covered
with waves.And before then there was a deal to be seen and done, the
Bellows, the Gull Rock, Asparagus Island--even if we left out the
dangerous points with the ugly names that Curgenven had warned us
against.What is there in humanity, certainly in youthful humanity, that if
it can attain its end in two ways, one quiet and decorous, the other
difficult and dangerous, is certain to choose the latter?"We must manage to get you to the Bellows, it is such a curious sight,"
said my girls as they returned from it."Don't be frightened--come
along!"By dint of pulling, pushing, and the help of stick and arm, I came:
stood watching the spout of water which, in certain conditions of the
tide, forces itself through a tiny fissure in the rock with a great
roar, and joined in the childish delight of waiting, minute by minute,
for the biggest spout, the loudest roar.But Asparagus Island (where was no asparagus at all) I totally
declined.Not being a goat or a chamois, I contented myself with
sitting where I could gain the best view of the almost invisible
path by which my adventurous young "kids" disappeared.Happily they
had both steady heads and cool nerves; they were neither rash nor
unconscientious.I knew they would come back as soon as they could.So
I waited patiently, contemplating a fellow-victim who seemed worse off
than myself; a benign-looking clergyman, who kept walking up and down
the soppy sands, and shouting at intervals to two young people, a man
and a woman, who appeared to be crawling like flies along the face of
the rock towards another rock, with a yawning cave and a wide fissure
between.the clergyman cried at the top of his voice."Your young people seem rather venturesome," said I sympathetically.[Illustration: THE STEEPLE ROCK, KYNANCE COVE.]"Not _my_ young people," was the dignified answer."My girls are up
there, on Asparagus Rock, which is easy enough climbing.They promised
not to go farther, and they never disobey their mother and me.I declare he is taking her to the most dangerous part, that
rock where you have to jump--a good jump it is, and if you miss your
footing you are done for, you go right into the boiling waves below.Well, it's no business of mine; she is his own property; he is engaged
to her, but"--

I fear I made some very severe remarks on the folly of a young man who
could thus risk life and limbs--not only his own, but those of his wife
to be; and on the weakness of a girl who could allow herself to be
tempted, even by a lover, into such selfish foolhardiness."They must manage their own affairs," said the old gentleman
sententiously, perhaps not being so much given to preaching (out of the
pulpit) as I was.And very sensible girls they looked, clad in a practical, convenient
fashion, just fitted for scrambling.By them I sent a message to my own
girls, explaining the best descent from Asparagus Island, and repeating
the warning against attempting Hell's Mouth."Yes, you are quite right," said my elderly friend, as we sat down
together on the least uncomfortable stone we could find, and watched
the juniors disappear over the rocks."I like to see girls active and
brave; I never hinder them in any reasonable enjoyment, even though
there may be risk in it--one must run some risk--and a woman may
have to save life as well as a man.But foolhardy bravado I not only
dislike--I _despise_ it."In which sentiments I so entirely agreed that we fraternised there
and then; began talking on all sorts of subjects--some of them the
very serious and earnest subjects that one occasionally drops into by
mere chance, with mere strangers.I recall that half hour on Kynance
Sands as one of the pleasant memories of our tour, though to this day
I have not the remotest idea who my companion was.Except that as soon
as he spoke I recognised the reader whose voice had so struck me in
last night's thanksgiving service; reminding me of Frederick Denison
Maurice, whom this generation is almost beginning to forget, but whom
we elders never can forget.The tide was creeping on now--nay, striding, wave after wave, through
"parlour" and "drawing-room," making ingress and egress alike
impossible.In fact, a newly arrived party of tourists, who had stood
unwisely long contemplating the Bellows, were seen to gaze in despair
from their rock which had suddenly become an island.No chance for them
except to wade--and in a few minutes more they would probably have
to swim ashore.What became of them we did not stay to see, for an
anxious, prudent little voice, always thoughtful for "mother," insisted
on our precipitate flight before the advancing tide.Kynance, lovely as
it is, has its inconveniences.Departing, we met a whole string of tourist-looking people, whom we
benevolently warned that they were too late, at which they did not
seem in the least disappointed.Probably they were one of the numerous
pic-nic parties who come here from Falmouth or Helstone, to spend a
jovial day of eating and drinking, and enjoy the delights of the flesh
rather than the spirit.At any rate the romance and solitude of the place were gone.The quaint
old woman at the serpentine shop--a mild little wooden erection under
the cliff--was being chaffed and bargained with by three youths with
cigars, which defiled the whole air around, and made us take refuge up
the hill.But even there a white umbrella had sprung up like a gigantic
mushroom, and under it sat an energetic lady artist, who, entering at
once into conversation, with a cheerful avidity that implied her not
having talked for a week, informed us of all she was painting, and all
she had meant to paint, where she lodged, and how much she paid for her
lodging--evidently expecting the same confidences from us in return.But we were getting hungry, and between us and dinner was a long
two-miles walk over the steep downs, that were glowing, nay, burning,
under the September sun.So we turned homeward, glad of more than one
rest by the way, and a long pause beside a pretty little stream; where
we were able to offer the immemorial cup of cold water to several
thirsty souls besides ourselves.Some of us by this time were getting
to feel not so young as we had fancied ourselves in the early morning,
and to wish regretfully for Charles and his carriage.However, we got home at last--to find that sad accompaniment of many a
holiday--tidings of sickness and death.Nothing very near us--nothing
that need hurry us home--but enough to sadden us, and make our evening
walk, which we bravely carried out, a far less bright one than that of
the forenoon.The girls had found a way, chiefly on the tops of "hedges," to the
grand rock called Lizard Point.Thither we went, and watched the
sunset--a very fine one; then came back through the village, and made
various purchases of serpentine from John Curgenven's wife, who was
a great deal younger than himself, but not near so handsome or so
original.But a cloud had come over us; it did not, and must not stay--still,
there it was for the time.When the last thing at night I went out into
the glorious moonlight--bright as day--and thought of the soul who had
just passed out of a long and troubled life into the clearness of life
eternal, it seemed as if all was right still.Small cares and worries
dwindled down or melted away--as the petty uglinesses around melted
in the radiance of this glorious harvest moon, which seemed to wrap
one round in a silent peace, like the "garment of praise," which David
speaks about--in exchange for "the spirit of heaviness."DAY THE EIGHTH


And seven days were all we could allow ourselves at the Lizard, if we
meant to see the rest of Cornwall.We began to reckon with sore hearts
that five days were already gone, and it seemed as if we had not seen
half we ought to see, even of our near surroundings."We will take no excursion to-day.We will just have our bath at Housel
Cove and then we will wander about the shore, and examine the Lizard
Lights.Only fancy, our going away to-morrow without having seen the
inside of the Lizard Lights!Oh, I wish we were not leaving so soon.We
shall never like any place as we like the Lizard."Directly after breakfast--and we are
people who never vary from our eight o'clock breakfast, so that we
always see the world in its early morning brightness and freshness--we
went

  "Brushing with hasty steps the dew away,"

along the fields, which led down to Housel or Househole Cove.Before
us, clear in the sunshine, rose the fine headland of Penolver, and
the green <DW72>s of the amphitheatre of Belidden, supposed to be the
remains of a Druidical temple.That, and the chair of Belidden, a
recess in the rock, whence there is a splendid view, with various
archaeological curiosities, true or traditionary, we ought to have
examined, I know.Some of us were content to
rejoice in the general atmosphere of beauty and peace without minute
investigation, and some of us were so eminently practical that "a good
bathe" appeared more important than all the poetry and archaeology in
the world.So we wandered slowly on, rejoicing at having the place all to
ourselves, when we came suddenly upon a tall black figure intently
watching three other black figures, or rather dots, which were climbing
slowly over Penolver.It was our clerical friend of Kynance; with whom, in the natural and
right civility of holiday-makers, we exchanged a courteous good morning.[Illustration: THE LION ROCKS--A SEA IN WHICH NOTHING CAN LIVE.]"Yes, those are my girls up on the cliff there.They have been bathing,
and are now going to walk to Cadgwith.""Then nobody fell into the Devil's Throat at Kynance?They all came
back to you with whole limbs?""Yes," said he smiling, "and they went again for another long walk
in the afternoon.At night, when it turned out to be such splendid
moonlight, they actually insisted on going launce-fishing.Of course
you know about launce-fishing?"I pleaded my utter ignorance of that noble sport."Oh, it is _the_ thing at the Lizard.My boys--and girls too--consider
it the best fun going.The launce is a sort of sand-eel peculiar to
these coasts.It swims about all day, and at night burrows in the sand
just above the waterline, where, when the moon shines on it, you can
trace the silvery gleam of the creature.So you stand up to your ankles
on wet sand, with a crooked iron spear which you dart in and hook him
up, keeping your left hand free to seize him with.""Easy fishing," said I, with a certain pity for the sand-eel.You are apt either to chop him right in
two, or miss him altogether, when off he wriggles in the sand and
disappears.My young people say it requires a practised hand and a
peculiar twist of the wrist, to have any success at all in launce
fishing.It can only be done on moonlight nights--the full moon and
a day or two after--and they are out half the night.They go about
barefoot, which is much safer than soaked shoes and stockings.About
midnight they light a fire on the sand, cook all the fish they have
caught, and have a grand supper, as they had last night.They came home
as merry as crickets about two o'clock this morning.Perhaps you might
not have noticed what a wonderful moonlight night it was?"I had; but it would not have occurred to me to spend it in standing for
hours up to the knees in salt water, catching unfortunate fish.However, tastes differ, and launce-fishing may be a prime delight to
some people; so I faithfully chronicle it, and the proper mode of
pursuing it, as one of the attractions at the Lizard.I am not aware
that it is practised at any other part of the Cornish coast, nor can
I say whether or not it was a pastime of King Arthur and his Knights.One cannot imagine Sir Tristram or Sir Launcelot occupied in spearing a
small sand-eel.The bathing at Housel Cove was delightful as ever.And afterwards we
saw that very rare and beautiful sight, a perfect solar rainbow.Not
the familiar bow of Noah, but a great luminous circle round the sun,
like the halo often seen round the moon, extending over half the sky;
yellow at first, then gradually assuming faint prismatic tints.This
colouring, though never so bright as the ordinary arched rainbow, was
wonderfully tender and delicate.We stood a long time watching it,
till at last it melted slowly out of the sky, leaving behind a sense of
mystery, as of something we had never seen before and might never see
again in all our lives.It was a lovely day, bright and warm as midsummer, tempting us to some
distant excursion; but we had decided to investigate the Lizard Lights.We should have been content to take them for granted, in their purely
poetical phase, as we had watched them night after night.But some of
us were blessed with scientific relatives, who would have despised us
utterly if we had spent a whole week at the Lizard and never gone to
see the Lizard Lights.So we felt bound to do our duty, and admire, if
we could not understand.I chronicle with shame that the careful and
courteous explanations of that most intelligent young man, who met us
at the door of the huge white building, apparently quite glad to have
an opportunity of conducting us through it, were entirely thrown away.We mounted ladders, we looked at Brobdingnagian lamps, we poked into
mysterious machinery for lighting them and for sounding the fog-horn,
we listened to all that was told us, and tried to look as if we took it
in.Very much interested we could not but be at such wonderful results
of man's invention, but as for comprehending!we came away with our
minds as dark as when we went in.I have always found through life that, next to being clever, the safest
thing is to know one's own ignorance and acknowledge it.Therefore let
me leave all description of the astonishing mechanism of the Lizard
Lights--I believe the first experiment of their kind, and not very
long established--to abler pens and more intelligent brains.To see
that young man, scarcely above the grade of a working man, handling
his instruments and explaining them and their uses, seeming to take
for granted that we could understand--which alas!we didn't, not
an atom!--inspired me with a sense of humiliation and awe.Also of
pride at the wonders this generation has accomplished, and is still
accomplishing; employing the gradually comprehended forces of Nature
against herself, as it were, and dominating her evil by ever-new
discoveries and applications of the recondite powers of good.The enormous body of light produced nightly--equal, I think he said,
to 30,000 candles--and the complicated machinery for keeping the
fog-horn continually at work, when even that gigantic blaze became
invisible--all this amount of skill, science, labour, and money,
freely expended for the saving of life, gave one a strong impression of
not only British power but British beneficence.Could King Arthur have
come back again from his sea-engulfed Land of Lyonesse, and stood where
we stood, beside the Lizard Lights, what would he have said to it all?[Illustration: HAULING IN THE BOATS.]Even though we did not understand, we were keenly interested in all we
saw, and still more so in the stories of wrecks which this young man
had witnessed even during the few years, or months--I forget which--of
his stay at the Lizard.He, too, agreed, that the rocks there, called
by the generic name of the Stags, were the most fatal of all on our
coasts to ships outward and homeward bound.Probably because in the
latter case, captain and crews get a trifle careless; and in the
former--as I have heard in sad explanation of many emigrant ships being
lost almost immediately after quitting port--they get drunk.Many of
the sailors are said to come on board "half-seas over," and could the
skilfullest of pilots save a ship with a drunken crew?Be that as it may, the fact remains, that throughout winter almost
every week's chronicle at the Lizard is the same story--wild storms, or
dense fogs, guns of distress heard, a hasty manning of the life-boat,
dragged with difficulty down the steep cliff-road, a brief struggle
with the awful sea, and then, even if a few lives are saved, with the
ship herself all is over."Only last Christmas I saw a vessel go to pieces in ten minutes on the
rocks below there," said the man, after particularising several wrecks,
which seemed to have imprinted themselves on his memory with all their
incidents."Yes, we have a bad time in winter, and the coastguard
men lead a risky life.They are the picked men of the service, and
tolerably well paid, but no money could ever pay them for what they go
through--or the fishermen, who generally are volunteers, and get little
or nothing.""It must be a hard life in these parts, especially in winter," we
observed."Well, perhaps it is, but it's our business, you see."Yes, but not all people do their business, as the mismanagements and
mistakes of this world plainly show.Still, it is a good world, and we felt it so as we strolled along the
sunshiny cliff, talking over all these stories, tragical or heroic,
which had been told us in such a simple matter-of-fact way, as if they
were every-day occurrences.And then, while the young folks went on
"for a good scramble" over Penolver, I sat down for a quiet "think";
that enforced rest, which, as years advance, becomes not painful, but
actually pleasant; in which, if one fails to solve the problems of the
universe, one is prone to con them over, wondering at them all.From the sunny sea and sunny sky, full of a silence so complete that I
could hear every wave as it broke on the unseen rocks below, my mind
wandered to that young fellow among his machinery, with his sickly
eager face and his short cough--indicating that _his_ "business" in
this world, over which he seemed so engrossed, might only too soon
come to an end.Between these apparently eternal powers of Nature,
so strong, so fierce, so irresistible, against which man fought so
magnificently with all his perfection of scientific knowledge and
accuracy of handiwork--and this poor frail human life, which in a
moment might be blown out like a candle, suddenly quenched in darkness,
"there is no skill or knowledge in the grave whither thou goest"--what
a contrast it was!And yet--and yet?--We shall sleep with our fathers, and some of us feel
sometimes so tired that we do not in the least mind going to sleep.But
notwithstanding this, notwithstanding everything without that seems to
imply our perishableness, we are conscious of something within which
is absolutely imperishable.We feel it only stronger and clearer as
life begins to melt away from us; as "the lights in the windows are
darkened, and the daughters of music are brought low."To the young,
death is often a terror, for it seems to put an end to the full, rich,
passionate life beyond which they can see nothing; but to the old,
conscious that this their tabernacle is being slowly dissolved, and yet
its mysterious inhabitant, the wonderful, incomprehensible _me_, is
exactly the same--thinks, loves, suffers, and enjoys, precisely as it
did heaven knows how many years ago--to them, death appears in quite
another shape.He is no longer Death the Enemy, but Death the Friend,
who may--who can tell?--give back all that life has denied or taken
away.He cannot harm us, and he may bless us, with the blessing of
loving children, who believe that, whatever happens, nothing can take
them out of their Father's arms.But I had not come to Cornwall to preach, except to myself now and
then, as this day.My silent sermon was all done by the time the
young folks came back, full of the beauties of their cliff walk, and
their affectionate regrets that I "could never manage it," but must
have felt so dull, sitting on a stone and watching the sheep and the
sea-gulls.I was obliged to confess that I never am "dull,"
as people call it, and love solitude almost as much as society.[Illustration: ENYS DODNAN AND PARDENICK POINTS.]So, each contented in our own way, we went merrily home, to find
waiting for us our cosy tea--the last!--and our faithful Charles, who,
according to agreement, appeared overnight, to take charge of us till
we got back to civilisation and railways."Yes, ladies, here I am," said he with a beaming countenance."And
I've got you the same carriage and the same horse, as you wished, and
I've come in time to give him a good night's rest.Now, when shall you
start, and what do you want to do to-morrow?"Our idea had been to take for our next resting-place Marazion.This
queer-named town had attracted us ever since the days when we learnt
geography.Since, we had heard a good deal about it: how it had
been inhabited by Jewish colonists, who bought tin from the early
Ph[oe]nician workers of the Cornish mines, and been called by them
Mara-Zion--bitter Zion--corrupted by the common people into Market-Jew.Michael's Mount opposite; and attracted
us much more than genteel Penzance.So did a letter we got from the
landlord of its one hotel, promising to take us in, and make us
thoroughly comfortable.Charles declared we could, and even see
a good deal on the road.Mary will be delighted to get another
peep at you ladies, and while I rest the horse you can go in and look
at the old church--it's very curious, they say.And then we'll go on
to Gunwalloe,--there's another church there, close by the sea, built
by somebody who was shipwrecked.But then it's so old and so small.However, we can stop and look at it if you like."His good common sense, and kindliness, when he might so easily have
done his mere duty and taken us the shortest and ugliest route, showing
us nothing, decided us to leave all in Charles's hands, and start at
10 A.M.for Penzance, _via_ Helstone, where we all wished to
stay an hour or two, and find out a "friend," the only one we had in
Cornwall.So all was settled, with but a single regret, that several boating
excursions we had planned with John Curgenven had all fallen through,
and we should never behold some wonderful sea-caves between the Lizard
and Cadgwith, which we had set our hearts upon visiting.Charles fingered his cap with a thoughtful air."I don't see why you
shouldn't, ladies.If I was to go direct and tell John Curgenven to
have a boat ready at Church Cove, and we was to start at nine instead
of ten, and drive there, the carriage might wait while you rowed to
the caves and back; we should still reach Helstone by dinner-time, and
Marazion before dark."And at this addition to his
work Charles looked actually pleased!So--all was soon over, our easy packing done, our bill paid--a very
small one--our goodnights said to the kindly handmaid, Esther, who
hoped we would come back again some time, and promised to keep the
artistic mural decorations of our little parlour in memory of us.My
young folks went to bed, and then, a little before midnight, when all
the house was quiet, I put a shawl over my head, unlatched the innocent
door--no bolts or bars at the Lizard--and went out into the night.What a night it was!--mild as summer, clear as day: the full moon
sailing aloft in an absolutely cloudless sky.Not a breath, not a
sound--except the faint thud-thud of the in-coming waves, two miles
off, at Kynance, the outline of which, and of the whole coast, was
distinctly visible.A silent earth, lying under a silent heaven.Looking up, one felt almost like a disembodied soul, free to cleave
through infinite space and gain--what?Is it human or divine, this ceaseless longing after something never
attained, this craving after the eternal life, which, if fully believed
in, fully understood, would take all the bitterness out of this life?But so much is given, and all given is so infinitely good, except where
we ourselves turn it into evil, that surely more, and better, will be
given to us by and by.Those only truly enjoy life who fear not death:
who can say of the grave as if it were their bed: "I will lay me down
in peace and take my rest, for it is Thou only, O God, who makest me to
dwell in safety."DAY THE NINTH


And our last at the Lizard, which a week ago had been to us a mere word
or dot in a map; now we carried away from it a living human interest in
everything and everybody.Esther bade us a cordial farewell: Mrs.Curgenven, standing at the
door of her serpentine shop, repeated the good wishes, and informed
us that John and his boat had already started for Church Cove.As we
drove through the bright little Lizard Town, and past the Church of
Landewednack, wondering if we should ever see either again, we felt
quite sad.Leaving the carriage and Charles at the nearest point to the Cove, we
went down the steep descent, and saw John rocking in his boat, and
beckoning to us with a bland and smiling countenance.But between us
and him lay a sort of causeway, of the very roughest rocks, slippery
with sea-weed, and beat upon by waves--such waves!Yet clearly, if we
meant to get into the boat at all, we must seize our opportunity and
jump in between the flux and reflux of that advancing tide.I am not a coward: I love boats, and was well used to them in my youth,
but now--my heart misgave me.There were but two alternatives--to
stop the pleasure of the whole party, and leave Cornwall with these
wonderful sea-caves unseen, or to let my children go alone.Neither was
possible; so I hailed a sturdy youth at work hard by, and asked him if
he would take charge of an old lady across the rocks.He grinned from
ear to ear, but came forward, and did his duty manfully and kindly.My
young folks, light as feathers, bounded after; and with the help of
John Curgenven, chivalrous and careful as ever, we soon found ourselves
safely in the boat.[Illustration: JOHN CURGENVEN FISHING.]"Here we go up, up, up, and here we go down,
down, down," was the principle of our voyage, the most serious one we
ever took in an open boat with a single pair of oars.Never did I see
such waves,--at least, never did I float upon them, in a boat that went
tossing like a bit of cork out into the open sea.John seemed not to mind them in the least.His strong arms swept the
boat along, and he still found breath to talk to us, pointing out the
great gloomy cliffs we were passing under, and telling us stories of
wrecks, the favourite theme--and no wonder.This sunshiny morning that iron-bound coast looked awful enough; what
must it have looked like, on the winter night when the emigrant ship
_Brest_ went down!"Yes, it was about ten o'clock at night," said John."I was fast asleep
in bed, but they knocked me up; I got on my clothes and was off in
five minutes.They are always glad enough to get us fishermen, the
coastguard are.Mine was the first boat-load we brought ashore; we
would only take women and children that time.They were all in their
night-gowns, and they couldn't speak a word of English, but we made
them understand somehow.One woman threw her three children down to me,
and stayed behind on the wreck with two more.""Oh, no, they were very quiet, dazed like.Some of them seemed to be
saying their prayers.But they made no fuss at all, not even the little
ones.They lay down in the bottom of the boat, and we rowed ashore
as fast as we could, to Cadgwith.Then we rowed back and fetched two
boatloads more.We saved a lot of lives that wreck, but only their
lives; they had scarcely a rag of clothes on, and some of the babies
were as naked as when they were born.""Everybody: we always do it," answered John, as if surprised at
the question."The fishermen's cottages were full, and so was the
parsonage.We gave them clothes, and kept them till they could be sent
away.Yes, it was an awful night; I got something to remember it by,
here."He held out his hand, from which we noticed half of one finger was
missing."It got squeezed off with a rope somehow.I didn't heed it much at
the time," said John carelessly."But look, we're at the first of the
caves.I'll row in close, ladies, and let you see it."So we had to turn our minds from the vision of the wreck of the
_Brest_, which John's simple words made so terribly vivid, to examine
Raven's Ugo, and Dolor Ugo; _ugo_ is Cornish for cave.Over the
entrance of the first a pair of ravens have built from time immemorial.It is just accessible, the opening being above the sea-line, and hung
with quantities of sea-ferns.Here in smuggling days, many kegs of
spirits used to be secreted: and many a wild drama no doubt has been
acted there--daring encounters between smugglers and coastguard men,
not bloodless on either side.Dolor Ugo is now inaccessible and unusable.Its only floor is of
heaving water, a deep olive green, and so clear that we could see the
fishes swimming about pursuing a shoal of launce.Its high-vaulted roof
and sides were tinted all colours--rose-pink, rich dark brown, and
purple.The entrance was wide enough to admit a boat, but it gradually
narrowed into impenetrable darkness.How far inland it goes no one can
tell, as it could only be investigated by swimming, a rather dangerous
experiment.Boats venture as far as the daylight goes; and it is a
favourite trick of the boatman suddenly to fire off a pistol, which
reverberates like thunder through the mysterious gloom of the cave.A solemn place; an awful place, some of us thought, as we rowed in, and
out again, into the sunshiny open sea.Which we had now got used to;
and it was delicious to go dancing like a feather up and down, trusting
to John Curgenven's stout arm and fearless, honest face.We felt sad to
think this would be our last sight of him and of the magnificent Lizard
coast.But the minutes were lessening, and we had some way still to
row.Also to land, which meant a leap between the waves upon slippery
sea-weedy rocks.In silent dread I watched my children accomplish this
feat, and then--

Well, it is over, and I sit here writing these details.But I would
not do it again, not even for the pleasure of revisiting Dolor Ugo and
having a row with John Curgenven.he looked relieved when he saw "the old lady" safe on
_terra firma_, and we left him waving adieux, as he "rocked in his
boat in the bay."May his stout arms and kindly heart long remain to
him!May his summer tourists be many and his winter shipwrecks few!I am sure he will always do his duty, and see that other people do
theirs, or, like the proverbial Cornishmen, he "will know the reason
why."Charles was ready; waiting patiently in front of a blacksmith's shop.fate had overtaken us in the shape of an innocent leak in
John Curgenven's boat; nothing, doubtless, to him, who was in the habit
of baling it out with his boots, and then calmly putting them on again,
but a little inconvenient to us.To drive thirty miles with one's
garments soaked up to the knees was not desirable.There was a cottage close by, whence came the gleam of a delicious fire
and the odour of ironing clothes.We went in: the mistress, evidently
a laundress, advanced and offered to dry us--which she did, chattering
all the while in the confidential manner of country folks.A hard working, decent body she was, and as for her house, it was a
perfect picture of cleanliness and tidiness.Its two rooms, kitchen and
bedroom, were absolutely speckless.When we noticed this, and said we
found the same in many Cornish cottages; she almost seemed offended at
the praise."Oh, that's nothing, ma'am.We hereabouts all likes to have our places
tidy.Mine's not over tidy to-day because of the washing.But if you was to come of a Sunday.Her eye
caught something in a dark corner, at which she flew, apron in hand."I
declare, I'm quite ashamed.I didn't think we had one in the house."Dried, warmed, and refreshed, but having found the greatest difficulty
in inducing the good woman to receive any tangible thanks for her
kindness, we proceeded on our journey; going over the same ground which
we had traversed already, and finding Pradenack Down as bleak and
beautiful as ever.Our first halt was at the door of Mary Mundy, who,
with her unappreciated brother, ran out to meet us, and looked much
disappointed when she found we had not come to stay."But you will come some time, ladies, and I'll make you so comfortable.And you'll give my duty to the professor"--it was vain to explain that
four hundred miles lay between our home and his.He was a very nice gentleman, please'm.I shall be delighted to
see him again, please'm," &c., &c.

We left the three--Mary, her brother, and Charles--chattering together
in a dialect which I do not attempt to reproduce, and sometimes could
hardly understand.Us, the natives indulged with their best English,
but among themselves they talked the broadest Cornish.It was a very old church, and a preternaturally old beadle showed it in
a passive manner, not recognising in the least its points of interest
and beauty, except some rows of open benches with ancient oak backs,
wonderfully carved."Our vicar dug them up from under the flooring and turned them into
pews.There was a gentleman here the other day who said there was
nothing like them in all England."Most curious, in truth, they were, and suited well the fine old
building--a specimen of how carefully and lavishly our forefathers
built "for God."We, who build for ourselves, are rather surprised
to find in out-of-the-way nooks like this, churches that in size and
adornment must have cost years upon years of loving labour as well as
money.It was pleasant to know that the present incumbent, a man of
archaeological tastes, appreciated his blessings, and took the utmost
care of his beautiful old church.even though he cannot
boast the power of his predecessor, the Reverend Thomas Flavel, who
died in 1682, and whose monument in the chancel really expresses the
sentiments--in epitaph--of the period:

  "Earth, take thine earth; my sin, let Satan have it;
  The world my goods; my soul my God who gave it.For from these four, Earth, Satan, World, and God,
  My flesh, my sin, my goods, my soul, I had."But it does not mention that the reverend gentleman was the best
_ghost-layer_ in all England, and that when he died his ghost also
required to be laid, by a brother clergyman, in a spot on the down
still pointed out by the people of Mullion, who, being noted for
extreme longevity, have passed down this tradition from generation
to generation, with an earnest credulity that we of more enlightened
counties can hardly understand.From Mullion we went on to Gunwalloe.Its church, "small and old," as
Charles had depreciatingly said, had been so painfully "restored,"
and looked so bran-new and uninteresting that we contented ourselves
with a distant look.It was close to the sea--probably built on the
very spot where its pious founder had been cast ashore.The one curious
point about it was the detached belfry, some yards distant from the
church itself.It sat alone in a little cove, down which a sluggish
river crawled quietly seaward.A sweet quiet place, but haunted, as
usual, by tales of cruel shipwrecks--of sailors huddled for hours on
a bit of rock just above the waves, till a boat could put out and
save the few survivors; of sea treasures continually washed ashore
from lost ships--Indian corn, coffee, timber, dollars--many are still
found in the sand after a storm.And one treasure more, of which the
recollection is still kept at Gunwalloe, "a little dead baby in its cap
and night-gown, with a necklace of coral beads."Our good horse, with the dogged
persistency of Cornish horses and Cornish men, plodded on mile after
mile.Sometimes for an hour or more we did not meet a living soul;
then we came upon a stray labourer, or passed through a village where
healthy-looking children, big-eyed, brown-faced, and dirty-handed,
picturesque if not pretty, stared at us from cottage doors, or from the
gates of cottage gardens full of flowers and apples.Hungry and thirsty, we could not
resist them.After passing several trees, hung thickly with delicious
fruit, we attacked the owner of one of them, a comely young woman, with
a baby in her arms and another at her gown."Oh yes, ma'am, you may have as many apples as you like, if your young
ladies will go and get them."And while they did it, she stood talking by the carriage door, pouring
out to me her whole domestic history with a simple frankness worthy of
the golden age."No, really I couldn't," putting back my payment--little enough-- for
the splendid basket of apples which the girls brought back in triumph."This is such a good apple year; the pigs would get them if the young
ladies didn't.You're kindly welcome to them--well then, if you are
determined, say sixpence."On which magnificent "sixpenn'orth," we lived for days!Indeed I think
we brought some of it home as a specimen of Cornish fruit and Cornish
liberality.[Illustration: THE ARMED KNIGHT AND THE LONG SHIP'S LIGHTHOUSE.]Helstone was reached at last, and we were not sorry for rest and food
in the old-fashioned inn, whence we could look out of window, and
contemplate the humours of the little town, which doubtless considered
itself a very great one.It was market day, and the narrow street was
thronged with beasts and men--the latter as sober as the former,
which spoke well for Cornwall.Sober and civil too was every one we
addressed in asking our way to the house of our unknown friend, whose
only address we had was Helstone.But he seemed well known in the town,
though neither a rich man, nor a great man, nor--No, I cannot say he
was not a clever man, for in his own line, mechanical engineering, he
must have been exceedingly clever.And he was what people call "a great
character;" would have made such an admirable study for a novelist,
manipulated into an unrecognisable ideal--the only way in which it is
fair to put people in books.When I saw him I almost regretted that I
write novels no more.We passed through the little garden--all ablaze with autumn colour,
every inch utilised for either flowers, vegetables, or fruit--went into
the parlour, sent our cards and waited the result.In two minutes our friend appeared, and gave us such a welcome!But to
explain it I must trench a little upon the sanctities of private life,
and tell the story of this honest Cornishman.When still young he went to Brazil, and was employed by an English
gold-mining company there, for some years.Afterwards he joined
an engineering firm, and superintended dredging, the erection of
saw-mills, &c., finally building a lighthouse, of which latter work he
had the sole charge, and was exceedingly proud.His conscientiousness,
probity, and entire reliableness made him most valuable to the
firm; whom he served faithfully for many years.When they, as well
as himself, returned to England, he still kept up a correspondence
with them, preserving towards every member of the family the most
enthusiastic regard and devotion.He rushed into the parlour, a tall, gaunt, middle-aged man, with a
shrewd, kindly face, which beamed all over with delight, as he began
shaking hands indiscriminately, saying how kind it was of us to come,
and how welcome we were.It was explained which of us he had specially to welcome, the others
being only humble appendages, friends of the family, this well-beloved
family, whose likenesses for two generations we saw everywhere about
the room."Yes, miss, there they all are, your dear grandfather" (alas, only a
likeness now!They were all so good to
me, and I would do anything for them, or for any one of their name.If
I got a message that they wanted me for anything, I'd be off to London,
or to Brazil, or anywhere, in half-an-hour."added the good man when the rapture and
excitement of the moment had a little subsided, and his various
questions as to the well-being of "the family" had been asked and
answered."You have dined, you say, but you'll have a cup of tea.My
wife (that's the little maid I used to talk to your father about, miss;
I always told him I wouldn't stay in Brazil, I must go back to England
and marry my little maid), my wife makes the best cup of tea in all
Cornwall.And there entered, in afternoon gown and cap, probably just put on, a
middle-aged, but still comely matron, who insisted that, even at this
early hour--3 P.M.--to get a cup of tea for us was "no trouble
at all.""Indeed, she wouldn't think anything a trouble, no more than I should,
miss, if it was for your family.It was here suggested that they were not a "forgetting" family.Nor
was he a man likely to be soon forgotten.While the cup of tea, which
proved to be a most sumptuous meal, was preparing, he took us all over
his house, which was full of foreign curiosities, and experimental
inventions.One, I remember, being a musical instrument, a sort of
organ, which he had begun making when a mere boy, and taken with him
all the way to Brazil and back.It had now found refuge in the little
room he called his "workshop," which was filled with odds and ends that
would have been delightful to a mechanical mind.He expounded them with
enthusiasm, and we tried not to betray an ignorance, which in some of
us would have been a sort of hereditary degradation.they were clever--your father and your uncle!--and how proud we
all were when we finished our lighthouse, and got the Emperor to light
it up for the first time.Look here, ladies, what do you think this is?"He took out a small parcel, and solemnly unwrapped from it fold after
fold of paper, till he came to the heart of it--a small wax candle!"This was the candle the Emperor used to light our lighthouse.I've
kept it for nearly thirty years, and I'll keep it as long as I live.Every year on the anniversary of the day I light it, drink his
Majesty's health, and the health of all your family, miss, and then I
put it out again.So"--carefully re-wrapping the relic in its numerous
envelopes--"so I hope it will last my time."Here the mistress came behind her good man, and they exchanged a
smile--the affectionate smile of two who had never been more than two,
Darby and Joan, but all sufficient to each other.How we got through it I hardly know,
but travelling is hungry work, and the viands were delicious.The
beneficence of our kind hosts, however, was not nearly done."Come, ladies, I'll show you my garden, and--(give me a basket and the
grape-scissors,)" added he in a conjugal aside.Which resulted in our
carrying away with us the biggest bunches in the whole vinery, as well
as a quantity of rosy apples, stuffed into every available pocket and
bag."Nonsense, nonsense," was the answer to vain remonstrances."D'ye
think I wouldn't give the best of everything I had to your family?How your father used to laugh at me about my
little maid!Oh yes, I'm glad I came
home.And now your father and your uncle are home too, and perhaps some
day they'll come to see me down here--wouldn't it be a proud day for
me!It was touching, and rare as touching, this passionate personal
fidelity.It threw us back, at least such of us as were sentimentally
inclined, upon that something in Cornish nature which found its
exposition in Arthur and his faithful knights, down to "bold Sir
Bedevere," and apparently, is still not lost in Cornwall.With a sense of real regret, feeling that it would be long ere we
might meet his like--such shrewd simplicity, earnest enthusiasm, and
exceeding faithfulness--we bade good-bye to the honest man; leaving him
and his wife standing at their garden-gate, an elderly Adam and Eve,
desiring nothing outside their own little paradise.Which of us could
say more, or as much?Gratefully we "talked them over," as we drove on through the pretty
country round Helstone--inland country; for we had no time to go and
see the Loe Pool, a small lake, divided from the sea by a bar of sand.This is supposed to be the work of the Cornwall man-demon, Tregeagle;
and periodically cut through, with solemn ceremonial, by the Mayor of
Helstone, when the "meeting of the waters," fresh and salt, is said to
be an extremely curious sight.But we did not see it, nor yet Nonsloe
House, close by, which is held by the tenure of having to provide a
boat and nets whenever the Prince of Wales or the Duke of Cornwall
wishes to fish in the Loe Pool.A circumstance which has never happened
yet, certainly!Other curiosities _en route_ we also missed, the stones of
Tremenkeverne, half a ton each, used as missiles in a notable fight
between two saints, St.Just of the Land's End, and St.Keverne of the
Lizard, and still lying in a field to prove the verity of the legend.Also the rock of Goldsithney, where, when the "fair land of Lyonesse"
was engulfed by the sea, an ancestor of the Trevelyans saved himself by
swimming his horse, and landing; and various other remarkable places,
with legends attached, needing much credulity, or imagination, to
believe in.But, fearing to be benighted ere reaching Marazion, we passed them all,
and saw nothing more interesting than the ruins of disused tin mines,
which Charles showed us, mournfully explaining how the mining business
had of late years drifted away from Cornwall, and how hundreds of the
once thriving community had been compelled to emigrate or starve.As we
neared Marazion, these melancholy wrecks with their little hillocks of
mining debris rose up against the evening sky, the image of desolation.Michael's Mount, the picture in little of Mont St.Michel,
in Normandy, appeared in the middle of Mount's Bay.Lastly, after
a gorgeous sunset, in a golden twilight and silvery moonlight, we
entered Marazion;-and found it, despite its picturesque name, the most
commonplace little town imaginable!We should have regretted our rash decision, and gone on to Penzance,
but for the hearty welcome given us at a most comfortable and home-like
inn, which determined us to keep to our first intention, and stay.So, after our habit of making the best of things, we walked down to the
ugly beach, and investigated the dirty-looking bay--in the lowest of
all low tides, with a soppy, sea-weedy causeway running across to St.By advice of Charles, we made acquaintance with an old
boatman he knew, a Norwegian who had drifted hither--shipwrecked, I
believe--settled down and married an English woman, but whose English
was still of the feeblest kind.However, he had an honest face; so we
engaged him to take us out bathing early to-morrow."Wouldn't you
like to row round the Mount?--When you've had your tea, I'll come back
for you, and help you down to the shore--it's rather rough, but nothing
like what you have done, ma'am," added he encouragingly."And it will
be bright moonlight, and the Mount will look so fine."So, the spirit of adventure conquering our weariness, we went.When
I think how it looked next morning--the small, shallow bay, with its
toy-castle in the centre, I am glad our first vision of it was under
the glamour of moonlight, with the battlemented rock throwing dark
shadows across the shimmering sea.In the mysterious beauty of that
night row round the Mount, we could imagine anything; its earliest
inhabitant, the giant Cormoran, killed by that "valiant Cornishman,"
the illustrious Jack; the lovely St.Keyne, a king's daughter, who came
thither on pilgrimage; and, passing down from legend to history, Henry
de la Pomeroy, who, being taken prisoner, caused himself to be bled to
death in the Castle; Sir John Arundel, slain on the sands, and buried
in the Chapel; Perkin Warbeck's unfortunate wife, who took refuge at
St.And so on, and so on,
through the centuries, to the family of St.Aubyn, who bought it in
1660, and have inhabited it ever since."Very nice people," we heard
they were; who have received here the Queen, the Prince of Wales, and
other royal personages.Yet, looking up as we rowed under the gloomy rock, we could fancy his
giant ghost sitting there, on the spot where he killed his wife, for
bringing in her apron greenstone, instead of granite, to build the
chapel with.Which being really built of greenstone the story must be
true!What a pleasure it is to be able to believe anything!Some of us could have stayed out half the night, floating along in the
mild soft air and dreamy moonlight, which made even the commonplace
little town look like a fairy scene, and exalted St.Michael's Mount
into a grand fortress, fit for its centuries of legendary lore--but
others preferred going to bed.Not however without taking a long look out
of the window upon the bay, which now, at high tide, was one sheet of
rippling moon-lit water, with the grim old Mount, full of glimmering
lights like eyes, sitting silent in the midst of the silent sea.[Illustration: CORNISH FISHERMAN.]DAY THE TENTH


I cannot advise Marazion as a bathing place.What a down-come from the
picturesque vision of last night, to a small ugly fishy-smelling beach,
which seemed to form a part of the town and its business, and was
overlooked from everywhere!Yet on it two or three family groups were
evidently preparing for a dip, or rather a wade of about a quarter of a
mile in exceedingly dirty sea water."This will never do," we said to our old Norwegian."You must row us to
some quiet cove along the shore, and away from the town."He nodded his head, solemn and mute as the dumb boatman of dead Elaine,
rowed us out seaward for about half-a-mile, and then proceeded to
fasten the boat to a big stone, and walk ashore.The water still did
not come much above his knees--he seemed quite indifferent to it.Well, we could but do at Rome as the Romans do.Toilette in an open
boat was evidently the custom of the country.And the sun was warm, the
sea safe and shallow.Indeed, so rapidly did it subside, that by the
time the bath was done, we were aground, and had to call at the top of
our voices to our old man, who sat, with his back to us, dim in the
distance, on another big stone, calmly smoking the pipe of peace."We'll not try this again," was the unanimous resolve, as, after
politely declining a suggestion that "the ladies should walk ashore--"
did he think we were amphibious?--we got ourselves floated off at last,
and rowed to the nearest landing point, the entrance to St.Probably nowhere in England is found the like of this place.Such
a curious mingling of a mediaeval fortress and modern residence; of
antiquarian treasures and everyday business; for at the foot of the
rock is a fishing village of about thirty cottages, which carries
on a thriving trade; and here also is a sort of station for the tiny
underground-railway, which worked by a continuous chain, fulfils the
very necessary purpose (failing Giant Cormoran, and wife) of carrying
up coals, provisions, luggage, and all other domestic necessaries to
the hill top.Thither we climbed by a good many weary steps, and thought, delightful
as it may be to dwell on the top of a rock in the midst of the sea,
like eagles in an eyrie, there are certain advantages in living on a
level country road, or even in a town street.Aubyns manage when they go out to dinner?Two years afterwards,
when I read in the paper that one of the daughters of the house,
leaning over the battlements, had lost her balance and fallen down,
mercifully unhurt, to the rocky <DW72> below--the very spot where we
to-day sat so quietly gazing out on the lovely sea view--I felt with
a shudder that on the whole, it would be a trying thing to bring up a
young family on St.Still, generation after generation of honourable St.Aubyns have
brought up their families there, and oh!How fresh, and yet mild blew the soft sea-wind outside of it, and
inside, what endless treasures there were for the archaeological mind!The chapel alone was worth a morning's study, even though shown--odd
anachronism--by a footman in livery, who pointed out with great gusto
the entrance to a vault discovered during the last repairs, where was
found the skeleton of a large man--his bones only--no clue whatever as
to who he was or when imprisoned there.The "Jeames" of modern days
told us this tale with a noble indifference.Nothing of the kind was
likely to happen to him.Further still we were fortunate enough to penetrate, and saw the Chevy
Chase Hall, with its cornice of hunting scenes, the drawing-room, the
school-room--only fancy learning lessons there, amidst the veritable
evidence of the history one was studying!And perhaps the prettiest bit
of it all was our young guide, herself a St.Aubyn, with her simple
grace and sweet courtesy, worthy of one of the fair ladies worshipped
by King Arthur's knights.[Illustration: THE SEINE BOAT--A PERILOUS MOMENT.]We did not like encroaching on her kindness, though we could have
stayed all day, admiring the curious things she showed us.So we
descended the rock, and crossed the causeway, now dry, but very rough
walking--certainly St.Michael's Mount has its difficulties as a modern
dwelling-house--and went back to our inn.For, having given our
horse a forenoon's rest, we planned a visit to that spot immortalised
by nursery rhyme--

  "As I was going to St.Ives
  I met a man with seven wives.Each wife had seven sacks;
  Each sack had seven cats;
  Each cat had seven kits;
  Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,--
  How many were there going to St.--One; and after we had been there, we felt sure he never went again!There were two roads, we learnt, to that immortal town; one very good,
but dull; the other bad--and beautiful.We chose the latter, and never
repented.Nor, in passing through Penzance, did we repent not having taken up our
quarters there.It was pretty, but so terribly "genteel," so extremely
civilised.Glancing up at the grand hotel, we thought with pleasure of
our old-fashioned inn at Marazion, where the benign waiter took quite
a fatherly interest in our proceedings, even to giving us for dinner
our very own blackberries, gathered yesterday on the road, and politely
hindering another guest from helping himself to half a dishful, as
"they belonged to the young ladies."Truly, there are better things in
life than fashionable hotels.But the neighbourhood of Penzance is lovely.Shrubs and flowers such
as one sees on the shores of the Mediterranean grew and flourished in
cottage-gardens, and the forest trees we drove under, whole avenues
of them, were very fine; gentlemen's seats appeared here and there,
surrounded with the richest vegetation, and commanding lovely views.As
the road gradually mounted upwards, we saw, clear as in a panorama, the
whole coast from the Lizard Point to the Land's End,--which we should
behold to-morrow.For, hearing that every week-day about a hundred tourists in carriages,
carts, and omnibuses, usually flocked thither, we decided that the
desire of our lives, the goal of our pilgrimage, should be visited
by us on a Sunday.We thought that to drive us thither in solitary
Sabbatic peace would be fully as good for Charles's mind and morals as
to hang all day idle about Marazion; and he seemed to think so himself.Therefore, in prospect of to-morrow, he dealt very tenderly with his
horse to-day, and turned us out to walk up the heaviest hills, of which
there were several, between Penzance and Castle-an-Dinas."There it is," he said at last, stopping in the midst of a wide moor
and pointing to a small building, sharp against the sky."The carriage
can't get further, but you can go on, ladies, and I'll stop and gather
some blackberries for you."For brambles, gorse bushes, and clumps of fading heather, with one or
two small stunted trees, were now the only curiosities of this, King
Arthur's famed hunting castle, and hunting ground, which spread before
us for miles and miles.Passing a small farm-house, we made our way to
the building Charles pointed out, standing on the highest ridge of the
promontory, whose furthest point is the Land's End.Standing there, we
could see--or could have seen but that the afternoon had turned grey
and slightly misty--the ocean on both sides.Inland, the view seemed
endless.Roughtor and Brown Willy, two Dartmoor hills, are said to be
visible sometimes.Nearer, little white dots of houses show the mining
districts of Redruth and Camborne.A single wayfarer, looking like a
working man in his Sunday best going to visit friends, but evidently
tired, as if he had walked for miles, just glanced at us, and passed
on.We stood, all alone, on the very spot where many a time must have
stood King Arthur, Queen Guinevere, Sir Launcelot, and the other
knights--or the real human beings, whether barbarian or not, who formed
the originals of those mythical personages.Nothing was left but a common-place little tower,
built up of the fragments of the old castle, and a wide, pathless
moor, over which the wind sighed, and the mist crept.No memorial
whatever of King Arthur, except the tradition--which time and change
have been powerless to annihilate--that such a man once existed.The
long vitality which the legend keeps proves that he must have been
a remarkable man in his day.Romance itself cannot exist without a
foundation in reality.So I preached to my incredulous juniors, who threw overboard King
Arthur and took to blackberry-gathering; and to conversation with a
most comely Cornishwoman, milking the prettiest of Cornish cows in the
lonely farm-yard, which was the only sign of humanity for miles and
miles.We admired herself and her cattle; we drank her milk, offering
for it the usual payment.But the picturesque milkmaid shook her head
and demanded just double what even the dearest of London milk-sellers
would have asked for the quantity.Which sum we paid in silence,
and I only record the fact here in order to state that spite of our
foreboding railway friend at Falmouth, this was the only instance in
which we were ever "taken in," or in the smallest degree imposed upon,
in Cornwall.Another hour, slowly driving down the gradual <DW72> of the country,
through a mining district much more cheerful than that beyond Marazion.The mines were all apparently in full work, and the mining villages
were pretty, tidy, and cosy-looking, even picturesque.Ives the houses had quite a foreign look, but when we descended to
the town, its dark, narrow streets, pervaded by a "most ancient and
fish-like smell," were anything but attractive.As was our hotel, where, as a matter of duty, we ordered tea, but
doubted if we should enjoy it, and went out again to see what little
there seemed to be seen, puzzling our way through the gloomy and not
too fragrant streets, till at last in despair we stopped a bland,
elderly, Methodist-minister-looking gentleman, and asked him the way to
the sea."You're strangers here, ma'am?"I owned the humbling fact, as the inhabitant of St."And is it the pilchard fishery you want to see?A few pilchards have been seen already.There are the boats, the
fishermen are all getting ready.It's a fine sight to see them start.Would you like to come and look at them?"He had turned back and was walking with us down the street, pointing
out everything that occurred to him as noticeable, in the kindest and
civilest way.When we apologised for troubling him, and would have
parted company, our friend made no attempt to go."Oh, I've nothing at all to do, except"--he took out the biggest and
most respectable of watches--"except to attend a prayer-meeting at
half-past six.I should have time to show you the town; we think it is
a very nice little town.I ought to know it; I've lived in it, boy and
man for thirty-seven years.But now I have left my business to my sons,
and I just go about and amuse myself, looking into the shop now and
then just for curiosity.You must have seen my old shop, ladies, if you
came down that street."Which he named, and also gave us his own name, which we had seen over
the shop door, but I shall not record either.Not that I think the
honest man is ever likely to read such "light" literature as this book,
or to recall the three wanderers to whom he was so civil and kind, and
upon whom he poured out an amount of local and personal facts, which
we listened to--as a student of human nature is prone to do--with an
amused interest in which the comic verged on the pathetic.How large
to each man seems his own little world, and what child-like faith he
has in its importance to other people!I shall always recall our friend
at St.Ives, with his prayer-meetings, his chapel-goings--I concluded
he was a Methodist, a sect very numerous in Cornwall--his delight in
his successful shop and well-brought-up sons, who managed it so well,
leaving him to enjoy his _otium cum dignitate_--no doubt a municipal
dignity, for he showed us the Town Hall with great gusto.Evidently to
his honest, simple soul, St.By and by again he pulled out the turnip-like watch."Just ten minutes
to get to my prayer-meeting, and I never like to be late, I have been a
punctual man all my life, ma'am," added he, half apologetically, till
I suggested that this was probably the cause of his peace and success.Upon which he smiled, lifted his hat with a benign adieu, hoped we had
liked St.Ives--we had liked his company at any rate--and with a final
pointing across the street, "There's my shop, ladies, if you would care
to look at it," trotted away to his prayer-meeting.Ives, especially Tregenna, its
ancient mansion transformed into an hotel, is exceedingly pretty, but
night was falling fast, and we saw nothing.Speedily we despatched a
most untempting meal, and hurried Charles's departure, lest we should
be benighted, as we nearly were, during the long miles of straight and
unlovely road--the good road--between here and Penzance.We had done
our duty, we had seen the place, but as, in leaving it behind us, we
laughingly repeated the nursery rhyme, we came to the conclusion that
the man who was "_going_ to St.Ives" was the least fortunate of all
those notable individuals.DAY THE ELEVENTH


The last thing before retiring, we had glanced out on a gloomy sea, a
starless sky, pitch darkness, broken only by those moving lights on St.Michael's Mount, and thought anxiously of the morrow.It would be hard,
if after journeying thus far and looking forward to it so many years,
the day on which we went to the Land's End should turn out a wet day!Still "hope on, hope ever," as we used to write in our copy-books.Some
of us, I think, still go on writing it in empty air, and will do so
till the hand is dust.It was with a feeling almost of solemnity that we woke and looked out
on the dawn, grey and misty, but still not wet.To be just on the point
of gaining the wish of a life-time, however small, is a fact rare
enough to have a certain pathos in it.We slept again, and trusted
for the best, which by breakfast-time really came, in flickering
sun-gleams, and bits of hopeful blue sky.We wondered for the last
time, as we had wondered for half a century, "what the Land's End would
be like," and then started, rather thoughtful than merry, to find out
the truth of the case.Glad as we were to have for our expedition this quiet Sunday instead
of a tumultuous week day, conscience smote us in driving through
Penzance, with the church-bells ringing, and the people streaming along
to morning service, all in their Sunday best.Perhaps we might manage
to go to afternoon church at Sennen, or St.Sennen's, which we knew
by report, as the long-deceased father of a family we were acquainted
with had been curate there early in the century, and we had promised
faithfully "just to go and look at the old place."But one can keep Sunday sometimes even outside church-doors.I shall
never forget the Sabbatic peace of that day; those lonely and lovely
roads, first rich with the big trees and plentiful vegetation about
Penzance, then gradually growing barer and barer as we drove along the
high promontory which forms the extreme point westward of our island.The way along which so many tourist-laden vehicles pass daily was
now all solitary; we scarcely saw a soul, except perhaps a labourer
leaning over a gate in his decent Sunday clothes, or two or three
children trotting to school or church, with their books under their
arms.Unquestionably Cornwall is a respectable, sober-minded county;
religious-minded too, whether Methodist, Quaker, or other nonconformist
sects, of which there are a good many, or decent, conservative Church
of England.Buryan's--a curious old church founded on the place where
an Irishwoman, Saint Buriana, is said to have made her hermitage.A
few stray cottages comprised the whole village.There was nothing
special to see, except to drink in the general atmosphere of peace and
sunshine and solitude, till we came to Treryn, the nearest point to the
celebrated Logan or rocking-stone.From childhood we had read about it; the most remarkable specimen in
England of those very remarkable stones, whether natural or artificial,
who can decide?"Which the touch of a finger alone sets moving,
  But all earth's powers cannot shake from their base."Not quite true, this; since in 1824 a rash and foolish Lieutenant
Goldsmith (let his name be gibbeted for ever!)did come with a boat's
crew, and by main force remove the Logan a few inches from the point
on which it rests.Indignant justice very properly compelled him, at
great labour and pains, to put it back again, but it has never rocked
properly since.By Charles's advice we took a guide, a solemn-looking youth, who
stalked silently ahead of us along the "hedges," which, as at the
Lizard, furnished the regular path across the fields coastwards.Soon the gleaming circle of sea again flashed upon us, from behind a
labyrinth of rocks, whence we met a couple of tourists returning."You'll find it a pretty stiff climb to the Logan, ladies," said one of
them in answer to a question.And so we should have done, indeed, had not our guide's hand been
much readier than his tongue.I, at least, should never have got even
so far as that little rock-nest where I located myself--a somewhat
anxious-minded old hen--and watched my chickens climb triumphantly that
enormous mass of stone which we understood to be the Logan.they shouted across the dead stillness, the
lovely solitude of sky and sea.And I suppose it did rock, but must
honestly confess _I_ could not see it stir a single inch.However, it was a big stone, a very big stone, and the stones
around it were equally huge and most picturesquely thrown together.Also--delightful to my young folks!--they furnished the most
adventurous scramble that heart could desire.I alone felt a certain
relief when we were all again on smooth ground, with no legs or arms
broken.The cliff-walk between the Logan and the Land's End is said to be one
of the finest in England for coast scenery.Treryn or Treen Dinas,
Pardeneck Point, and Tol Pedn Penwith had been named as places we ought
to see, but this was impracticable.We had to content ourselves with a
dull inland road, across a country gradually getting more barren and
ugly, till we found ourselves suddenly at what seemed the back-yard of
a village public-house, where two or three lounging stable-men came
forward to the carriage, and Charles jumped down from his box.I forbear to translate the world of meaning implied in that brief
exclamation.Perhaps we shall admire the place more
when we have ceased to be hungry."The words of wisdom were listened to; and we spent our first quarter of
an hour at the Land's End in attacking a skeleton "remain" of not too
daintily-cooked beef, and a cavernous cheese, in a tiny back parlour
of the--let me give it its right name--First and Last Inn, of Great
Britain."We never provide for Sunday," said the waitress, responding to a
sympathetic question on the difficulty it must be to get food here."It's very seldom any tourists come on a Sunday."At which we felt altogether humbled; but in a few minutes more our
contrition passed into sovereign content.We went out of doors, upon the narrow green plateau in front of the
house, and then we recognised where we were--standing at the extreme
end of a peninsula, with a long line of rocks running out still further
into the sea.That "great and wide sea, wherein are moving things
innumerable," the mysterious sea "kept in the hollow of His hand," who
is Infinity, and looking at which, in the intense solitude and silence,
one seems dimly to guess at what Infinity may be.Any one who wishes to
go to church for once in the Great Temple which His hands have builded,
should spend a Sunday at the Land's End.At first, our thought had been, What in the world shall we do here for
two mortal hours!Now, we wished we had had two whole days.A sunset, a
sunrise, a star-lit night, what would they not have been in this grand
lonely place--almost as lonely as a ship at sea?It would be next best
to finding ourselves in the middle of the Atlantic.But this bliss could not be; so we proceeded to make the best of what
we had.The bright day was darkening, and a soft greyness began to
creep over land and sea.No, not soft, that is the very last adjective
applicable to the Land's End.Even on that calm day there was a fresh
wind--there must be always wind--and the air felt sharper and more salt
than any sea-air I ever knew.Stimulating too, so that one's nerves
were strung to the highest pitch of excitement.We felt able to do
anything, without fear and without fatigue.So that when a guide came
forward--a regular man-of-war's-man he looked--we at once resolved to
adventure along the line of rocks, seaward, "out as far as anybody was
accustomed to go.""Ay, ay; I'll take you, ladies.That is--the young ladies might go--but
you--" eying me over with his keen sailor's glance, full of honesty and
good humour, "you're pretty well on in years, ma'am."Laughing, I told him how far on, but that I was able to do a good deal
yet."Oh, I've taken ladies much older than you.One the other day was
nearly seventy.So we'll do our best, ma'am.He offered a rugged, brown hand, as firm and steady as a mast, to hold
by, and nothing could exceed the care and kindliness with which he
guided every step of every one of us, along that perilous path, that
is, perilous except for cautious feet and steady heads.If you make one false step, you are done
for," said our guide, composedly as he pointed to the boiling whirl of
waters below.[Illustration: THE LAND'S END AND THE LOGAN ROCK.]Still, though a narrow and giddy path, there was a path, and the
exploit, though a little risky, was not fool-hardy.We should have
been bitterly sorry not to have done it--not to have stood for one
grand ten minutes, where in all our lives we may never stand again, at
the farthest point where footing is possible, gazing out upon that
magnificent circle of sea which sweeps over the submerged "land of
Lyonesse," far, far away, into the wide Atlantic.There were just two people standing with us, clergymen evidently, and
one, the guide told us, was "the parson at St.We spoke to
him, as people do speak, instinctively, when mutually watching such a
scene, and by and by we mentioned the name of the long-dead curate of
St.The "parson" caught instantly at the name.Oh, yes, my father knew him quite well.He used constantly
to walk across from Sennen to our house, and take us children long
rambles across the cliffs, with a volume of Southey or Wordsworth under
his arm.He was a fine young fellow in those days, I have heard, and an
excellent clergyman.And he afterwards married a very nice girl from
the north somewhere."The "nice girl" was now a sweet silver-haired little
lady of nearly eighty; the "fine young fellow" had long since departed;
and the boy was this grave middle-aged gentleman, who remembered both
as a tradition of his youth.What a sermon it all preached, beside this
eternal rock, this ever-moving, never-changing sea!But time was passing--how fast it does pass, minutes, ay, and years!We
bade adieu to our known unknown friend, and turned our feet backwards,
cautiously as ever, stopping at intervals to listen to the gossip of
our guide."Yes, ladies, that's the spot--you may see the hoof-mark--where General
Armstrong's horse fell over; he just slipped off in time, but the poor
beast was drowned.And here, over that rock, happened the most curious
thing.I wouldn't have believed it myself, only I knew a man that saw
it with his own eyes.Once a bullock fell off into the pool below
there--just look, ladies."(We did look, into a perfect Maelstrom of
boiling waves.)"Everybody thought he was drowned, till he was seen
swimming about unhurt.They fished him up, and exhibited him as a
curiosity."And again, pointing to a rock far out in the sea.Thirty years ago a ship went to pieces there, and
the captain and his wife managed to climb on to that rock.They held
on there for two days and a night, before a boat could get at them.At last they were taken off one at a time, with rockets and a rope;
the wife first.But the rope slipped and she fell into the water.She
was pulled out in a minute or so, and rowed ashore, but they durst
not tell her husband she was drowned.I was standing on the beach at
Whitesand Bay when the boat came in.I was only a lad, but I remember
it well, and her too lifted out all dripping and quite dead."They went back for him, and got him off safe, telling him nothing.But
when he found she was dead he went crazy-like--kept for ever saying,
'She saved my life, she saved my life,' till he was taken away by his
friends.Look out, ma'am, mind your footing; just here a lady slipped
and broke her leg a week ago.I had to carry her all the way to the
hotel.We all smiled at the comical candour of the honest sailor, who
proceeded to give us bits of his autobiography.He was Cornish born,
but had seen a deal of the world as an A.B.on board her Majesty's ship
_Agamemnon_."Of course you have heard of the _Agamemnon_, ma'am.I was in her off
Balaklava.His eyes brightened as we discussed names and places once
so familiar, belonging to that time, which now seems so far back as to
be almost historical."Then you know what a winter we had, and what a summer afterwards.I
came home invalided, and didn't attempt the service afterwards; but I
never thought I should come home at all.Yes, it's a fine place the
Land's End, though the air is so strong that it kills some folks right
off.Once an invalid gentleman came, and he was dead in a fortnight.But I'm not dead yet, and I stop here mostly all the year round."He sniffed the salt air and smiled all over his weather-beaten
face--keen, bronzed, blue-eyed, like one of the old Vikings.He was a
fine specimen of a true British tar.When, having seen all we could, we
gave him his small honorarium, he accepted it gratefully, and insisted
on our taking in return a memento of the place in the shape of a stone
weighing about two pounds, glittering with ore, and doubtless valuable,
but ponderous.Oh, the trouble it gave me to carry it home, and pack
and unpack it among my small luggage!But I did bring it home, and
I keep it still in remembrance of the Land's End, and of the honest
sailor of H.M.S.We could dream of an unknown Land's End no more.It
became now a real place, of which the reality, though different from
the imagination, was at least no disappointment.How few people in
attaining a life-long desire can say as much!Our only regret, an endurable one now, was that we had not carried out
our original plan of staying some days there--tourist-haunted, troubled
days they might have been, but the evenings and mornings would have
been glorious.With somewhat heavy hearts we summoned Charles and the
carriage, for already a misty drift of rain began sweeping over the sea."Still, we must see Whitesand Bay," said one of us, recalling a story
a friend had once told how, staying at Land's End, she crossed the bay
alone in a blinding storm, took refuge at the coastguard station, where
she was hospitably received, and piloted back with most chivalric care
by a coastguard, who did not tell her till their journey's end that he
had left at home a wife, and a baby just an hour old.We only caught a glimmer of the
bay through drizzling rain, which by the time we reached Sennen village
had become a regular downpour.Evidently, we could do no more that day,
which was fast melting into night."We'll go home," was the sad resolve, glad nevertheless that we had a
comfortable "home" to go to.So closing the carriage and protecting ourselves as well as we could
from the driving rain, we went forward, passing the Quakers' burial
ground, where is said to be one of the finest views in Cornwall; the
Nine Maidens, a circle of Druidical stones, and many other interesting
things, without once looking at or thinking of them.Half a mile from Marazion the rain ceased, and a light like that of the
rising moon began to break through the clouds.What a night it might
be, or might have been, could we have stayed at the Land's End!It is in great things as in small, the
worry, the torment, the paralysing burden of life.We
have done our best to be happy, and we have been happy.DAY THE TWELFTH


Monday morning.Black Monday we were half inclined to call it, knowing
that by the week's end our travels must be over and done, and that if
we wished still to see all we had planned, we must inevitably next
morning return to civilisation and railways, a determination which
involved taking this night "a long, a last farewell" of our comfortable
carriage and our faithful Charles."But it needn't be until night," said he, evidently loth to part from
his ladies."If I get back to Falmouth by daylight to-morrow morning,
master will be quite satisfied.I can take you wherever you like
to-day.""Oh, he shall get a good feed and a rest till the middle of the night,
then he'll do well enough.We shall have the old moon after one o'clock
to get home by.Between Penzance and Falmouth it's a good road, though
rather lonely."I should think it was, in the "wee hours" by the dim light of a waning
moon.But Charles seemed to care nothing about it, so we said no more,
but decided to take the drive--our last drive.Our minds were perplexed between Botallack Mine, the Gurnard's Head,
Lamorna Cove, and several other places, which we were told we must on
no account miss seeing, the first especially.Some of us, blessed with
scientific relatives, almost dreaded returning home without having seen
a single Cornish mine; others, lovers of scenery, longed for more of
that magnificent coast.But finally, a meek little voice carried the
day.[Illustration: SENNEN COVE."I was so disappointed--more than I liked to say--when it rained,
and I couldn't get my shells for our bazaar.If it wouldn't trouble anybody very much, mightn't we go again to
Whitesand Bay?"It was a heavenly day; to spend it
in delicious idleness on that wide sweep of sunshiny sand would be a
rest for the next day's fatigue.there
would be no temptation to put on miners' clothes, and go dangling in
a basket down to the heart of the earth, as the Princess of Wales was
reported to have done.The pursuit of knowledge may be delightful, but
some of us owned to a secret preference for _terra firma_ and the upper
air.We resolved to face opprobrium, and declare boldly we had "no
time" (needless to add no inclination) to go and see Botallack Mine.The Gurnard's Head cost us a pang to miss; but then we should catch a
second view of the Land's End.Yes, we would go to Whitesand Bay.It was a far shorter journey in sunshine than in rain, even though we
made various divergencies for blackberries and other pleasures.Never
had the sky looked bluer or the sea brighter, and much we wished that
we could have wandered on in dreamy peace, day after day, or even gone
through England, gipsy-fashion, in a house upon wheels, which always
seemed to me the very ideal of travelling.Pretty little Sennen, with its ancient
church and its new school house, where the civil schoolmaster gave me
some ink to write a post-card for those to whom even the post-mark
"Sennen" would have a touching interest, and where the boys and girls,
released for dinner, were running about.Board school pupils, no doubt,
weighted with an amount of learning which would have been appalling
to their grandfathers and grandmothers, the simple parishioners of
the "fine young fellow" half a century ago.As we passed through the
village with its pretty cottages and "Lodgings to Let," we could not
help thinking what a delightful holiday resort this would be for
a large small family, who could be turned out as we were when the
carriage could no farther go, on the wide sweep of green common,
gradually melting into silvery sand, so fine and soft that it was
almost a pleasure to tumble down the <DW72>s, and get up again, shaking
yourself like a dog, without any sense of dirt or discomfort.What a
paradise for children, who might burrow like rabbits and wriggle about
like sand-eels, and never come to any harm!Without thought of any danger, we began selecting our bathing-place,
shallow enough, with long strips of wet shimmering sand to be crossed
before reaching even the tiniest waves; when one of us, the cautious
one, appealed to an old woman, the only human being in sight."Folks ne'er bathe here.Whether she understood us or not, or whether we
quite understood her, I am not sure, and should be sorry to libel such
a splendid bathing ground--apparently.But maternal wisdom interposed,
and the girls yielded.When, half an hour afterwards, we saw a solitary
figure moving on a distant ledge of rock, and a black dot, doubtless
a human head, swimming or bobbing about in the sea beneath--maternal
wisdom was reproached as arrant cowardice.But the sand was delicious,
the sea-wind so fresh, and the sea so bright, that disappointment could
not last.We made an encampment of our various impedimenta, stretched
ourselves out, and began the search for shells, in which every
arm's-length involved a mine of wealth and beauty.Never except at one place, on the estuary of the Mersey, have I
seen a beach made up of shells so lovely in colour and shape; very
minute; some being no bigger than a grain of rice or a pin's head.The
collecting of them was a fascination.We forgot all the historical
interests that ought to have moved us, saw neither Athelstan, King
Stephen, King John, nor Perkin Warbeck, each of whom is said to have
landed here--what were they to a tiny shell, like that moralised over
by Tennyson in "Maud"--"small, but a work divine"?I think infinite
greatness sometimes touches one less than infinite littleness--the
exceeding tenderness of Nature, or the Spirit which is behind Nature,
who can fashion with equal perfectness a starry hemisphere and a
glow-worm; an ocean and a little pink shell.The only imperfection in
creation seems--oh, strange mystery!--to be man.But away with moralising, or dreaming, though this was just a day for
dreaming, clear, bright, warm, with not a sound except the murmur
of the low waves, running in an enormous length--curling over and
breaking on the soft sands.Everything was so heavenly calm, it seemed
impossible to believe in that terrible scene when the captain and his
wife were seen clinging to the Brisons rock, just ahead.Doubtless our friend of the _Agamemnon_ was telling this and all
his other stories to an admiring circle of tourists, for we saw the
Land's End covered with a moving swarm like black flies.How thankful
we felt that we had "done" it on a Sunday!Still, we were pleased
to have another gaze at it, with its line of picturesque rocks, the
Armed Knight and the Irish Lady--though, I confess, I never could make
out which was the knight and which was the lady.Can it be that some
fragment of the legend of Tristram and Iseult originated these names?After several sweet lazy hours, we went through a "fish-cellar," a
little group of cottages, and climbed a headland, to take our veritable
farewell of the Land's End, and then decided to go home.We had rolled
or thrown our provision basket, rugs, &c., down the sandy <DW72>, but it
was another thing to carry them up again.I went in quest of a small
boy, and there presented himself a big man, coastguard, as the only
unemployed hand in the place, who apologised with such a magnificent
air for not having "cleaned" himself, that I almost blushed to ask
him to do such a menial service as to carry a bundle of wraps.But
he accepted it, conversing amiably as we went, and giving me a most
graphic picture of life at Sennen during the winter.When he left me,
making a short cut to our encampment--a black dot on the sands, with
two moving black dots near it--a fisher wife joined me, and of her own
accord began a conversation.She and I fraternised at once, chiefly on the subject of children, a
group of whom were descending the road from Sennen School.She told me
how many of them were hers, and what prizes they had gained, and what
hard work it was.She could neither read nor write, she said, but she
liked her children to be good scholars, and they learnt a deal up at
Sennen.Apparently they did, and something else besides learning, for when I
had parted from my loquacious friend, I came up to the group just in
time to prevent a stand-up fight between two small mites, the _casus
belli_ of which I could no more arrive at, than a great many wiser
people can discover the origin of national wars.So I thought the
strong hand of "intervention"--civilised intervention--was best, and
put an end to it, administering first a good scolding, and then a coin.The division of this coin among the little party compelled an extempore
sum in arithmetic, which I required them to do (for the excellent
reason that I couldn't do it myself!)Therefore I
conclude that the heads of the Sennen school-children are as solid as
their fists, and equally good for use.[Illustration: ON THE ROAD TO ST.which as the fisher wife told me, only goes to
Penzance about once a year, and is, as yet, innocent of tourists, for
the swarm at the Land's End seldom goes near Whitesand Bay.Existence
here must be very much that of an oyster,--but perhaps oysters are
happy.By the time we reached Penzance the lovely day was dying into an
equally lovely evening.It was high water, the bay was all alive with boats, and there was
quite a little crowd of people gathered at the mild little station of
Marazion.A princess was expected, that young half-English, half-foreign
princess, in whose romantic story the British public has taken such an
interest, sympathising with the motherly kindness of our good Queen,
with the wedding at Windsor, and the sad little infant funeral there,
a year after.The Princess Frederica of Hanover, and the Baron Von
Pawel-Rammingen, her father's secretary, who, like a stout mediaeval
knight, had loved, wooed, and married her, were coming to St.Michael's
Mount on a visit to the St.Marazion had evidently roused itself, and risen to the occasion.Half
the town must have turned out to the beach, and the other half secured
every available boat, in which it followed, at respectful distance,
the two boats, one full of luggage, the other of human beings, which
were supposed to be the royal party.People speculated with earnest
curiosity, which was the princess, and which her husband, and what the
St.Aubyns would do with them; whether they would be taken to see the
Land's End, and whether they would go there as ordinary tourists, or in
a grand visit of state.How hard it is that royal folk can never see
anything except in state, or in a certain adventitious garb, beautiful,
no doubt, but satisfactorily hiding the real thing.How they must long
sometimes for a walk, after the fashion of Haroun Alraschid, up and
down Regent Street and Oxford Street!or an incognito foreign tour, or
even a solitary country walk, without a "lady-in-waiting."We had no opera-glass to add to the many levelled at those two boats,
so we went in--hoping host and guests would spend a pleasant evening in
the lovely old rooms we knew.We spent ours in rest, and in arranging
for to-morrow's flight.Also in consulting with our kindly landlady
as to a possible house at Marazion for some friends whom the winter
might drive southwards, like the swallows, to a climate which, in this
one little bay shut out from east and north, is--they told us--during
all the cruel months which to many of us means only enduring life, not
living--as mild and equable almost as the Mediterranean shores.And
finally, we settled all with our faithful Charles, who looked quite
mournful at parting with his ladies."Yes, it is rather a long drive, and pretty lonely," said he."But I'll
wait till the moons up, and that'll help us.We'll get into Falmouth
by daylight.I've got to do the same thing often enough through the
summer, so I don't mind it."Thus said the good fellow, putting a cheery face on it, then with a
hasty "Good-bye, ladies," he rushed away.But we had taken his address,
not meaning to lose sight of him.(Nor have we done so up to this date
of writing; and the fidelity has been equal on both sides.)Then, in the midst of a peal of bells which was kept up unweariedly
till 10 P.M.--evidently Marazion is not blessed with the sight
of a princess every day--we closed our eyes upon all outward things,
and went away to the Land of Nod.DAY THE THIRTEENTH


Into King Arthurs land--Tintagel his birth-place, and Camelford,
where he fought his last battle--the legendary region of which one
may believe as much or as little as one pleases--we were going
to-day.With the good common sense which we flattered ourselves had
accompanied every step of our unsentimental journey, we had arranged
all before-hand, ordered a carriage to meet the mail train, and hoped
to find at Tintagel--not King Uther Pendragon, King Arthur or King
Mark, but a highly respectable landlord, who promised us a welcome at
an inn--which we only trusted would be as warm and as kindly as that we
left behind us at Marazion.The line of railway which goes to the far west of England is one of the
prettiest in the kingdom on a fine day, which we were again blessed
with.It had been a wet summer, we heard, throughout Cornwall, but
in all our journey, save that one wild storm at the Lizard, sunshine
scarcely ever failed us.Ives
Bay or sweeping through the mining district of Redruth, and the wooded
country near Truro, Grampound, and St.Austell, till we again saw the
glittering sea on the other side of Cornwall--all was brightness.Then
darting inland once more, our iron horse carried us past Lostwithiel,
the little town which once boasted Joseph Addison, M.P., as its
representative; gave us a fleeting vision of Ristormel, one of the
ancient castles of Cornwall, and on through a leafy land, beginning to
change from rich green to the still richer yellows and reds of autumn,
till we stopped at Bodmin Road.No difficulty in finding our carriage, for it was the only one there;
a huge vehicle, of ancient build, the horses to match, capable of
accommodating a whole family and its luggage.We missed our compact
little machine, and our brisk, kindly Charles, but soon settled
ourselves in dignified, roomy state, for the twenty miles, or rather
more, which lay between us and the coast.Our way ran along lonely
quiet country roads and woods almost as green as when Queen Guinevere
rode through them "a maying," before the dark days of her sin and King
Arthur's death.Here it occurs to me, as it did this day to a practical youthful mind,
"What in the world do people know about King Arthur?"Well, most people have read Tennyson, and a few are acquainted with
the "Morte d'Arthur" of Sir Thomas Malory.But, perhaps I had better
briefly give the story, or as much of it as is necessary for the
edification of outsiders.Uther Pendragon, King of Britain, falling in love with Ygrayne, wife of
the duke of Cornwall, besieged them in their twin castles of Tintagel
and Terrabil, slew the husband, and the same day married the wife.Unto
whom a boy was born, and by advice of the enchanter Merlin, carried
away, from the sea-shore beneath Tintagel, and confided to a good
knight, Sir Ector, to be brought up as his own son, and christened
Arthur.On the death of the king, Merlin produced the youth, who was
recognized by his mother Ygrayne, and proclaimed king in the stead
of Uther Pendragon.He instituted the Order of Knights of the Round
Table, who were to go everywhere, punishing vice and rescuing oppressed
virtue, for the love of God and of some noble lady.He married
Guinevere, daughter of King Leodegrance, who forsook him for the love
of Sir Launcelot, his bravest knight and dearest friend.One by one,
his best knights fell away into sin, and his nephew Mordred raised a
rebellion, fought with him, and conquered him at Camelford.Seeing his
end was near, Arthur bade his last faithful knight, Sir Bedevere, carry
him to the shore of a mere (supposed to be Dozmare Pool) and throw in
there his sword Excalibur; when appeared a boat with three queens,
who lifted him in, mourning over him.With them he sailed away across
the mere, to be healed of his grievous wound.Some say that he was
afterwards buried in a chapel near, others declare that he lives still
in fairy land, and will reappear in latter days, to reinstate the Order
of Knights of the Round Table, and rule his beloved England, which will
then be perfect as he once tried to make it, but in vain.Camelford of to-day is certainly not the Camelot of King Arthur--but
a very respectable, commonplace little town, much like other country
towns; the same genteel linendrapers' and un-genteel ironmongers'
shops; the same old-established commercial inn, and a few ugly, but
solid-looking private houses, with their faces to the street and
their backs nestled in gardens and fields.Some of the inhabitants of
these said houses were to be seen taking a quiet afternoon stroll.Doubtless they are eminently respectable and worthy folk, leading a
mild provincial life like the people in Miss Martineau's _Deerbrook_,
or Miss Austen's _Pride and Prejudice_--of which latter quality they
have probably a good share.We let our horses rest, but we ourselves felt not the slightest wish to
rest at Camelford, so walked leisurely on till we came to the little
river Camel, and to Slaughter Bridge, said to be the point where King
Arthur's army was routed and where he received his death-wound.A
slab of stone, some little distance up the stream, is still called
"King Arthur's Tomb."But as his coffin is preserved, as well as his
Round Table, at Winchester; where, according to mediaeval tradition,
the bodies of both Arthur and Guinevere were found, and the head
of Guinevere had yellow hair; also that near the little village of
Davidstow, is a long barrow, having in the centre a mound, which is
called "King Arthur's grave"--inquiring minds have plenty of "facts" to
choose from.Possibly at last they had better resort to fiction, and
believe in Arthur's disappearance, as Tennyson makes him say,

  "To the island-valley of Avillion...
  Where I may heal me of my grievous wound."Dozmare Pool we found so far out of our route that we had to make a
virtue of necessity, and imagine it all; the melancholy moorland lake,
with the bleak hill above it, and stray glimpses of the sea beyond.A ghostly spot, and full of many ghostly stories besides the legend
of Arthur.Here Tregeagle, the great demon of Cornwall, once had his
dwelling, until, selling his soul to the devil, his home was sunk to
the bottom of the mere, and himself is heard of stormy nights, wailing
round it with other ghost-demons, in which the Cornish mind still
lingeringly believes.Visionary packs of hounds; a shadowy coach and
horses, which drives round and round the pool, and then drives into it;
flitting lights, kindled by no human hand, in places where no human
foot could go--all these tales are still told by the country folk, and
we might have heard them all.Might also have seen, in fancy, the flash
of the "brand Excalibur"; heard the wailing song of the three queens;
and pictured the dying Arthur lying on the lap of his sister Morgane la
Faye.But, I forgot, this is an un-sentimental journey.The Delabole quarries are as un-sentimental a place as one could
desire.It was very curious to come suddenly upon this world of slate,
piled up in enormous masses on either side the road, and beyond them
hills of debris, centuries old--for the mines have been worked ever
since the time of Queen Elizabeth.Houses, walls, gates, fences,
everything that can possibly be made of slate, is made.No green or
other colour tempers the all-pervading shade of bluish-grey, for
vegetation in the immediate vicinity of the quarries is abolished,
the result of which would be rather dreary, save for the cheerful
atmosphere of wholesome labour, the noise of waggons, horses,
steam-engines--such a contrast to the silence of the deserted tin-mines.But, these Delabole quarries passed, silence and solitude come back
again.Even the yearly-increasing influx of tourists fails to make
the little village of Trevena anything but a village, where the
said tourists lounge about in the one street, if it can be called a
street, between the two inns and the often-painted, picturesque old
post-office.Everything looked so simple, so home-like, that we were
amused to find we had to get ready for a _table d'hote_ dinner, in
the only available eating room where the one indefatigable waitress,
a comely Cornish girl, who seemed Argus and Briareus rolled into one,
served us--a party small enough to make conversation general, and
pleasant and intelligent enough to make it very agreeable, which does
not always happen at an English hotel.Then we sallied out to find the lane which leads to Tintagel Castle,
or Castles--for one sits in the sea, the other on the opposite heights
in the mainland, with power of communicating by the narrow causeway
which now at least exists between the rock and the shore.This seems to
confirm the legend, how the luckless husband of Ygrayne shut up himself
and his wife in two castles, he being slain in the one, and she married
to the victorious King Uther Pendragon, in the other.Both looked so steep and dangerous in the fast-coming twilight that we
thought it best to attempt neither, so contented ourselves with a walk
on the cliffs and the smooth green field which led thither.Leaning
against a gate, we stood and watched one of the grandest out of the
many grand sunsets which had blessed us in Cornwall.The black rock of
Tintagel filled the foreground; beyond, the eye saw nothing but sea,
the sea which covers vanished Lyonesse, until it met the sky, a clear
amber with long bars like waves, so that you could hardly tell where
sea ended and sky began.Then into it there swam slowly a long low
cloud, shaped like a boat, with a raised prow, and two or three figures
sitting at the stern."King Arthur and the three queens," we declared, and really a very
moderate imagination could have fancied it this."But what is that long
black thing at the bow?""Oh," observed drily the most practical of the three, "it's King
Arthur's luggage."We fell into fits of laughter, and
went home to tea and bed.DAYS FOURTEENTH, FIFTEENTH, AND SIXTEENTH--


And all Arthurian days, so I will condense them into one chapter, and
not spin out the hours that were flying so fast.Yet we hardly wished
to stop them; for pleasant as travelling is, the best delight of all
is--the coming home.Walking, to one more of those exquisite autumn days, warm as summer,
yet with a tender brightness that hot summer never has, like the love
between two old people, out of whom all passion has died--we remembered
that we were at Tintagel, the home of Ygrayne and Arthur, of King Mark
and Tristram and Iseult.I had to tell that story to my girls in the
briefest form, how King Mark sent his nephew, Sir Tristram, to fetch
home Iseult of Ireland for his queen, and on the voyage Bragswaine,
her handmaiden, gave each a love-potion, which caused the usual fatal
result; how at last Tristram fled from Tintagel into Brittany, where
he married another Iseult "of the white hands," and lived peacefully,
till, stricken by death, his fancy went back to his old love, whom he
implored to come to him.A tale--of which
the only redeeming point is the innocence, simplicity, and dignity of
the second Iseult, the unloved Breton wife, to whom none of our modern
poets who have sung or travestied the wild, passionate, miserable, ugly
story, have ever done full justice.These sinful lovers, the much-wronged but brutal King Mark, the
scarcely less brutal Uther Pendragon, and hapless Ygrayne--what a
curious condition of morals and manners the Arthurian legends unfold!A time when might was right; when every one seized what he wanted just
because he wanted it, and kept it, if he could, till a stronger hand
wrenched it from him.That in such a state of society there should
ever have arisen the dimmest dream of a man like Arthur--not perhaps
Tennyson's Arthur, the "blameless king," but even Sir Thomas Malory's,
founded on mere tradition--is a remarkable thing.Clear through all
the mists of ages shines that ideal of knighthood, enjoining courage,
honour, faith, chastity, the worship of God and the service of men.Also, in the very highest degree, inculcating that chivalrous love of
woman--not women--which barbaric nations never knew.As we looked at
that hoar ruin sitting solitary in the sunny sea, and thought of the
days when it was a complete fortress, inclosing a mass of human beings,
all with human joys, sorrows, passions, crimes--things that must have
existed in essence, however legend has exaggerated or altered them--we
could not but feel that the mere possibility of a King Arthur shining
down the dim vista of long-past centuries, is something to prove that
goodness, like light, has an existence as indestructible as Him from
whom it comes.We looked at Tintagel with its risky rock-path."It will be a hot
climb, and our bathing days are numbered.Let us go in the opposite
direction to Bossinney Cove."Practicality when weighed against Poetry is poor--Poetry always kicks
the beam.While waiting for
the tide to cover the little strip of sand, we re-mounted the winding
path, and settled ourselves like seabirds on the furthermost point of
rock, whence, just by extending a hand, we could have dropped anything,
ourselves even, into a sheer abyss of boiling waves, dizzy to look down
into, and yet delicious.So was the bath, though a little gloomy, for the sun could barely reach
the shut-in cove; and we were interfered with considerably by--not
tourists--but a line of donkeys!They were seen solemnly descending the
narrow cliff-path one by one--eleven in all--each with an empty sack
over his shoulder.Lastly came a very old man, who, without taking the
least notice of us, disposed himself to fill these sacks with sand.One after the other the eleven meek animals came forward and submitted
each to his load, which proceeding occupied a good hour and a half.I hardly know which was the most patient, the old man or his donkeys.[Illustration: CRESWICK'S MILL IN THE ROCKY VALLEY.]We began some of us to talk to his beasts, and others to himself."Yes,
it was hard work," he said, "but he managed to come down to the cove
three times a day.They all had their
names; Lucy, Cherry, Sammy, Tom, Jack, Ned;" each animal pricked up its
long ears and turned round its quiet eyes when called.Some were young
and some old, but all were very sure-footed, which was necessary here."The weight some of 'em would carry was wonderful."The old man seemed proud of the creatures, and kind to them too in a
sort of way.He had been a fisherman, he said, but now was too old for
that; so got his living by collecting sand."It makes capital garden-paths, this sand.I'd be glad to bring you
some, ladies," said he, evidently with an eye to business.When we
explained that this was impracticable, unless he would come all the way
to London, he merely said, "Oh," and accepted the disappointment.Then
bidding us a civil "Good day," he disappeared with his laden train.Nothing of the past knightly days, nothing of the
busy existing modern present affected him, or ever would do so.He
might have been own brother, or cousin, to Wordsworth's "Leech-gatherer
on the lonely moor."Whenever we think of Bossinney Cove, we shall
certainly think of that mild old man and his eleven donkeys.The day was hot, and it had been a steep climb; we decided to drive in
the afternoon, "for a rest," to Boscastle.Artists and tourists haunt this picturesque nook.A village built at
the end of a deep narrow creek, which runs far inland, and is a safe
shelter for vessels of considerable size.On either side is a high
footpath, leading to two headlands, from both of which the views of
sea and coast are very fine.And there are relics of antiquity and
legends thereto belonging--a green mound, all that remains of Bottrieux
Castle; and Ferrabury Church, with its silent tower.A peal of bells
had been brought, and the ship which carried them had nearly reached
the cove, when the pilot, bidding the captain "thank God for his safe
voyage," was answered that he "thanked only himself and a fair wind."Immediately a storm arose; and the ship went down with every soul on
board--except the pilot.So the church tower is mute--but on winter
nights the lost bells are still heard, sounding mournfully from the
depths of the sea.As we sat, watching with a vague fascination the spouting, minute by
minute, of a "blow-hole," almost as fine as the Kynance post-office--we
moralised on the story of the bells, and on the strange notions people
have, even in these days, of Divine punishments; imputing to the
Almighty Father all their own narrow jealousies and petty revenges,
dragging down God into the likeness of men, such an one as themselves,
instead of striving to lift man into the image of God.Meantime the young folks rambled and scrambled--watched with anxious
and even envious eyes--for it takes one years to get entirely
reconciled to the quiescence of the down-hill journey.And then we
drove slowly back--just in time for another grand sunset, with Tintagel
black in the foreground, until it and all else melted into darkness,
and there was nothing left but to

  "Watch the twilight stars come out
    Above the lonely sea."Next morning we must climb Tintagel, for it would be our last day.How softly the waves crept in upon the
beach--just as they might have done when they laid at Merlin's feet
"the little naked child," disowned of man but dear to Heaven, who was
to grow up into the "stainless king."He and his knights--the "shadowy people of the realm of dream,"--were
all about us, as, guided by a rheumatic old woman, who climbed feebly
up the stair, where generations of ghostly feet must have ascended and
descended, we reached a bastion and gateway, quite pre-historic.Other
ruins apparently belong to the eleventh or twelfth centuries.It may have been the very landing-place of King
Uther or King Mark, or other Cornish heroes, who held this wonderful
natural-artificial fortress in the dim days of old romance."Here are King Arthur's cups and saucers," said the old woman, pausing
in the midst of a long lament over her own ailments, to point out some
holes in the slate rock."And up there you'll find the chapel.It's an
easy climb--if you mind the path--just where it passes the spring."That spring, trickling down from the very top of the rock, and making
a verdant space all round it--what a treasure it must have been to the
unknown inhabitants who, centuries ago, entrenched themselves here--for
offence or defence--against the main-land.Peacefully it flowed on
still, with the little ferns growing, and the sheep nibbling beside
it.We idle tourists alone occupied that solitary height where those
long-past warlike races--one succeeding the other--lived and loved,
fought and died.The chapel--where the high altar and a little burial-ground beside it
can still be traced--is clearly much later than Arthur's time.However,
there are so few data to go upon, and the action of sea-storms destroys
so much every year, that even to the learned archaeologist, Tintagel is
a great mystery, out of which the imaginative mind may evolve almost
anything it likes.We sat a long time on the top of the rock--realising only the one
obvious fact that our eyes were gazing on precisely the same scene,
seawards and coastwards, that all these long-dead eyes were accustomed
to behold.Beaten by winds and waves till the grey of its slate
formation is nearly black; worn into holes by the constant action of
the tide which widens yearly the space between it and the main-land,
and gnaws the rock below into dangerous hollows that in time become
sea-caves, Tintagel still remains--and one marvels that so much of it
does still remain--a landmark of the cloudy time between legend and
actual history.Whether the ruin on the opposite height was once a portion of
Tintagel Castle, before the sea divided it, making a promontory into
an island--or whether it was the Castle Terrabil, in which Gorlois,
Ygrayne's husband, was slain--no one now can say.That both the twin
fortresses were habitable till Elizabeth's time, there is evidence to
prove.But since then they have been left to decay, to the silent sheep
and the screeching ravens, including doubtless that ghostly chough, in
whose shape the soul of King Arthur is believed still to revisit the
familiar scene.We did not see that notable bird--though we watched with interest two
tame and pretty specimens of its almost extinct species walking about
in a flower-garden in the village, and superstitiously cherished there.We were told that to this day no Cornishman likes to shoot a chough
or a raven.So they live and breed in peace among the twin ruins, and
scream contentedly to the noisy stream which dances down the rocky
hollow from Trevena, and leaps into the sea at Porth Hern--the "iron
gate," over against Tintagel.We thought we had seen everything, and come to an end, but at the hotel
we found a party who had just returned from visiting some sea-caves
beyond Tintagel, which they declared were "the finest things they had
found in Cornwall."It was a lovely calm day, and it was our last day.And, I think, the looser grows one's grasp of life, the greater is
one's longing to make the most of it, to see all we can see of this
wonderful, beautiful world.So, after a hasty meal, we found ourselves
once more down at Porth Hern, seeking a boat and man--alas!not John
Curgenven--under whose guidance we might brave the stormy deep.No sooner had we rounded the rock, than the baby
waves of the tiny bay grew into hills and valleys, among which our boat
went dancing up and down like a sea-gull!"Ay, there's some sea on, there always is here, but we'll be through it
presently," indifferently said the elder of the two boatmen; and plied
his oars, as, I think, only these Cornish boatmen can do, talking all
the while.He pointed out a slate quarry, only accessible from the sea,
unless the workmen liked to be let down by ropes, which sometimes had
to be done.We saw them moving about like black emmets among the clefts
of the rocks, and heard plainly above the sound of the sea the click
of their hammers.Strange, lonely, perilous work it must be, even in
summer.In winter--

"Oh, they're used to it; we're all used to it," said our man, who was
intelligent enough, though nothing equal to John Curgenven."Many a
time I've got sea-fowls' eggs on those rocks there," pointing to a
cliff which did not seem to hold footing for a fly.The
gentry buy them, and we're glad of the money.Dangerous?--yes, rather;
but one must earn one's bread, and it's not so bad when you take to it
young."Nevertheless, I think I shall never look at a collection of sea-birds'
eggs without a slight shudder, remembering those awful cliffs."Here you are, ladies, and the sea's down a bit, as I said.Hold on,
mate, the boat will go right into the cave."And before we knew what was happening, we found ourselves floated out
of daylight into darkness--very dark it seemed at first--and rocking
on a mass of heaving waters, shut in between two high walls, so narrow
that it seemed as if every heave would dash us in pieces against them;
while beyond was a dense blackness, from which one heard the beat of
the everlasting waves against a sort of tunnel, a stormy sea-grave from
which no one could ever hope to come out alive."I don't like this at all," said a small voice."Hadn't we better get out again?"But no sooner was this done than the third of the party longed to
return; and begged for "only five minutes" in that wonderful place,
compared to which Dolor Ugo, and the other Lizard caves, became as
nothing.Yet with its
terror was mingled an awful delight."Give me but five, nay, two
minutes more!""Very well, just as you choose," was the response of meek despair.The boatmen were told to row on into
daylight and sunshine--at least as much sunshine as the gigantic
overhanging cliffs permitted.And never, never, never in this world
shall I again behold that wonderful, mysterious sea-cave.But like all things incomplete, resigned, or lost, it has fixed itself
on my memory with an almost painful vividness.However, I promised not
to regret--not to say another word about it; and I will not.I did see
it, for just a glimpse; and that will serve.Two more pictures remain, the last gorgeous sunset, which I watched in
quiet solitude, sitting on a tombstone by Tintagel church--a building
dating from Saxon times, perched on the very edge of a lofty cliff,
and with a sea-view that reaches from Trevose Head on one side to Bude
Haven on the other.Also, our last long dreamy drive; in the mild
September sunshine, across the twenty-one miles of sparsely inhabited
country which lie between Tintagel and Launceston.In the midst of
it, on the top of a high flat of moorland, our driver turned round
and pointed with his whip to a long low mound, faintly visible about
half-a-mile off."There, ladies, that's King Arthur's grave."The third, at least, that we had either seen or heard of.These varied
records of the hero's last resting-place remind one of the three heads,
said to be still extant, of Oliver Cromwell, one when he was a little
boy, one as a young man, and the third as an old man.But after all my last and vividest recollection of King Arthur's
country is that wild sail--so wild that I wished I had taken it
alone--in the solitary boat, up and down the tossing waves in face of
Tintagel rock; the dark, iron-bound coast with its awful caves, the
bright sunshiny land, and ever-threatening sea.Just the region, in
short, which was likely to create a race like that which Arthurian
legend describes, full of passionate love and deadly hate, capable of
barbaric virtues, and equally barbaric crimes.An age in which the mere
idea of such a hero as that ideal knight

  "Who reverenced his conscience as his God:
  Whose glory was redressing human wrong:
  Who spake no slander, no, nor listened to it:
  Who loved one only, and who clave to her--"

rises over the blackness of darkness like a morning star.If Arthur could "come again"--perhaps in the person of one of the
descendants of a prince who was not unlike him, who lived and died
among us in this very nineteenth century--

  "Wearing the white flower of a blameless life--"

if this could be--what a blessing for Arthur's beloved England![Illustration: THE OLD POST-OFFICE, TREVENA.]L'ENVOI


Written more than a year after.The "old hen" and her chickens have
long been safe at home.A dense December fog creeps in everywhere,
choking and blinding, as I finish the history of those fifteen innocent
days, calm as autumn, and bright as spring, when we three took our
Unsentimental Journey together through Cornwall.Many a clever critic,
like Sir Charles Coldstream when he looked into the crater of Vesuvius,
may see "nothing in it"--a few kindly readers looking a little further,
may see a little more: probably the writer only sees the whole.But such as it is, let it stay--simple memorial of what Americans would
call "a good time," the sunshine of which may cast its brightness far
forward, even into that quiet time "when travelling days are done."LONDON:
  R. CLAY, SONS, AND TAYLOR,
  BREAD STREET HILL, E.C.It was just such a crowd as this that initiated a "nouveau" once in one
of the ateliers.They stripped the new-comer, and, as is often the
custom on similar festive occasions, painted him all over with
sketches, done in the powdered water-colors that come in glass jars.They are cheap and cover a lot of surface, so that the gentleman in
question looked like a human picture-gallery.After the ceremony, he was
put in a hamper and deposited, in the morning, in the middle of the Pont
des Arts, where he was subsequently found by the police, who carted him
off in a cab.[Illustration: THE FONTAINE DE MEDICIS]

But you must see more of this vast garden of the Luxembourg to
appreciate truly its beauty and its charm.Filled with beautiful
sculpture in bronze and marble, with its musee of famous modern pictures
bought by the Government, with flower-beds brilliant in geraniums and
fragrant in roses, with the big basin spouting a jet of water in its
center, where the children sail their boats, and with that superb
"Fontaine de Medicis" at the end of a long, rectangular basin of
water--dark as some pool in a forest brook, the green vines trailing
about its sides, shaded by the rich foliage of the trees overhead.On the other side of the Luxembourg you will find a garden of roses,
with a rich bronze group of Greek runners in the center, and near it,
back of the long marble balustrade, a croquet ground--a favorite spot
for several veteran enthusiasts who play here regularly, surrounded for
hours by an interested crowd who applaud and cheer the participants in
this passe sport.This is another way of spending an afternoon at the sole cost of one's
leisure.Often at the Punch and Judy show near-by, you will see two old
gentlemen,--who may have watched this same Punch and Judy show when they
were youngsters,--and who have been sitting for half an hour, waiting
for the curtain of the miniature theater to rise.It is popular--this
small "Theatre Guignol," and the benches in front are filled with the
children of rich and poor, who scream with delight and kick their
little, fat bare legs at the first shrill squeak of Mr.The three
who compose the staff of this tiny attraction have been long in its
service--the old harpist, and the good wife of the showman who knows
every child in the neighborhood, and her husband who is Mr.Punch, the
hangman, and the gendarme, and half a dozen other equally historical
personages.A thin, sad-looking man, this husband, gray-haired, with a
careworn look in his deep-sunken eyes, who works harder hourly, daily,
yearly, to amuse the heart of a child than almost any one I know.The little box of a theater is stifling hot in summer, and yet he must
laugh and scream and sing within it, while his good wife collects the
sous, talking all the while to this and to that child whom she has known
since its babyhood; chatting with the nurses decked out in their
gay-colored, Alsatian bows, the ribbons reaching nearly to the ground.A French nurse is a gorgeous spectacle of neatness and cleanliness, and
many of the younger ones, fresh from country homes in Normandy and
Brittany, with their rosy cheeks, are pictures of health.Wherever you
see a nurse, you will see a "piou-piou" not far away, which is a very
belittling word for the red-trousered infantryman of the Republique
Francaise.Surrounding the Palais du Luxembourg, these "piou-pious," less fortunate
for the hour, stand guard in the small striped sentry-boxes, musket at
side, or pace stolidly up and down the flagged walk.Marie, at the
moment, is no doubt with the children of the rich Count, in a shady spot
near the music.How cruel is the fate of many a gallant "piou-piou"!Farther down the gravel-walk strolls a young Frenchman and his
fiancee--the mother of his betrothed inevitably at her side!It is under
this system of rigid chaperonage that the young girl of France is given
in marriage.It is not to be wondered at that many of them marry to be
free, and that many of the happier marriages have begun with an
elopement![Illustration: THE PALACE OF THE LUXEMBOURG]

The music is over, and the band is filing out, followed by the crowd.A
few linger about the walks around the band-stand to chat.The old lady
who rents the chairs is stacking them up about the tree-trunks, and long
shadows across the walks tell of the approaching twilight.Overhead,
among the leaves, the pigeons coo.For a few moments the sun bathes
the great garden in a pinkish glow, then drops slowly, a blood-red disk,
behind the trees.The air grows chilly; it is again the hour to
dine--the hour when Paris wakes.In the smaller restaurants of the Quarter one often sees some strange
contrasts among these true bohemians, for the Latin Quarter draws its
habitues from every part of the globe.They are not all French--these
happy-go-lucky fellows, who live for the day and let the morrow slide.You will see many Japanese--some of them painters--many of them taking
courses in political economy, or in law; many of them titled men of high
rank in their own country, studying in the schools, and learning, too,
with that thoroughness and rapidity which are ever characteristic of
their race.You will find, too, Brazilians; gentlemen from Haiti of
darker hue; Russians, Poles, and Spaniards--men and women from every
clime and every station in life.They adapt themselves to the Quarter
and become a part of this big family of Bohemia easily and naturally.In this daily atmosphere only the girl-student from our own shores seems
out of place.She will hunt for some small restaurant, sacred in its
exclusiveness and known only to a dozen bon camarades of the Quarter.Perhaps this girl-student, it may be, from the West and her cousin from
the East will discover some such cosy little boite on their way back
from their atelier.To two other equally adventurous female minds they
will impart this newest find; after that you will see the four dining
there nightly together, as safe, I assure you, within these walls of
Bohemia as they would be at home rocking on their Aunt Mary's porch.There is, of course, considerable awkwardness between these bon
camarades, to whom the place really belongs, and these very innocent
new-comers, who seek a table by themselves in a corner under the few
trees in front of the small restaurant.And yet every one is exceedingly
polite to them.Madame the patronne hustles about to see that the dinner
is warm and nicely served; and Henriette, who is waiting on them, none
the less attentive, although she is late for her own dinner, which she
will sit down to presently with madame the patronne, the good cook, and
the other girls who serve the small tables.[Illustration: WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE THEATERS]

This later feast will be augmented perhaps by half the good boys and
girls who have been dining at the long table.Perhaps they will all come
in and help shell the peas for to-morrow's dinner.And yet this is a
public place, where the painters come, and where one pays only for what
one orders.It is all very interesting to the four American girls, who
are dining at the small table.But what must Mimi think of these silent and exclusive strangers, and
what, too, must the tall girl in the bicycle bloomers think, and the
little girl who has been ill and who at the moment is dining with
Renould, the artist, and whom every one--even to the cook, is so glad to
welcome back after her long illness?There is an unsurmountable barrier
between the Americans at the little table in the corner and that jolly
crowd of good and kindly people at the long one, for Mimi and Henriette
and the little girl who has been so ill, and the French painters and
sculptors with them, cannot understand either the language of these
strangers or their views of life.exclaims one of the strangers in a whisper, "do look at that
queer little 'type' at the long table--the tall girl in black actually
kissed him!"Why, my dear, I saw it plainly!"There is no law against kissing in the open air in Paris,
and besides, the tall girl in black has known the little "type" for a
Parisienne age--thirty days or less.The four innocents, who have coughed through their soup and whispered
through the rest of the dinner, have now finished and are leaving, but
if those at the long table notice their departure, they do not show it.In the Quarter it is considered the height of rudeness to stare.You
will find these Suzannes and Marcelles exceedingly well-bred in the
little refinements of life, and you will note a certain innate dignity
and kindliness in their bearing toward others, which often makes one
wish to uncover his head in their presence.CHAPTER IX

"THE RAGGED EDGE OF THE QUARTER"


There are many streets of the Quarter as quiet as those of a country
village.Some of them, like the rue Vaugirard, lead out past gloomy
slaughter-houses and stables, through desolate sections of vacant
lots, littered with the ruins of factory and foundry whose tall,
smoke-begrimed chimneys in the dark stand like giant sentries, as if
pointing a warning finger to the approaching pedestrian, for these
ragged edges of the Quarter often afford at night a lurking-ground for
footpads.In just such desolation there lived a dozen students, in a small nest of
studios that I need not say were rented to them at a price within their
ever-scanty means.It was marveled at among the boys in the Quarter that
any of these exiles lived to see the light of another day, after
wandering back at all hours of the night to their stronghold.Possibly their sole possessions consisted of the clothes they had on, a
few bad pictures, and their several immortal geniuses.That the
gentlemen with the sand-bags knew of this I am convinced, for the
students were never molested.Verily, Providence lends a strong and
ready arm to the drunken man and the fool!The farther out one goes on the rue Vaugirard, the more desolate
and forbidding becomes this long highway, until it terminates at
the fortifications, near which is a huge, open field, kept clear
of such permanent buildings as might shelter an enemy in time of
war.Scattered over this space are the hovels of squatters and
gipsies--fortune-telling, horse-trading vagabonds, whose living-vans
at certain times of the year form part of the smaller fairs within
the Quarter.[Illustration: (factory chimneys along empty street)]

And very small and unattractive little fairs they are, consisting of
half a dozen or more wagons, serving as a yearly abode for these
shiftless people; illumined at night by the glare of smoking oil
torches.There is, moreover, a dingy tent with a half-drawn red curtain
that hides the fortune-telling beauty; and a traveling shooting-gallery,
so short that the muzzle of one's rifle nearly rests upon the painted
lady with the sheet-iron breastbone, centered by a pinhead of a
bull's-eye which never rings.There is often a small carousel, too,
which is not only patronized by the children, but often by a crowd of
students--boys and girls, who literally turn the merry-go-round into a
circus, and who for the time are cheered to feats of bareback riding by
the enthusiastic bystanders.These little Quarter fetes are far different from the great fete de
Neuilly across the Seine, which begins at the Porte Maillot, and
continues in a long, glittering avenue of side-shows, with mammoth
carousels, bizarre in looking-glass panels and golden figures.Within
the circle of all this throne-like gorgeousness, a horse-power organ
shakes the very ground with its clarion blasts, while pink and white
wooden pigs, their tails tied up in bows of colored ribbons, heave and
swoop round and round, their backs loaded with screaming girls and
shouting men.It was near this very same Port Maillot, in a colossal theater, built
originally for the representation of one of the Kiralfy ballets, that a
fellow student and myself went over from the Quarter one night to "supe"
in a spectacular and melodramatic pantomime, entitled "Afrique a Paris."We were invited by the sole proprietor and manager of the show--an
old circus-man, and one of the shrewdest, most companionable, and
intelligent of men, who had traveled the world over.He spoke no
language but his own unadulterated American.This, with his dominant
personality, served him wherever fortune carried him!So, accepting his invitation to play alternately the dying soldier and
the pursuing cannibal under the scorching rays of a tropical limelight,
and with an old pair of trousers and a flannel shirt wrapped in a
newspaper, we presented ourselves at the appointed hour, at the edge of
the hostile country.[Illustration: (street scene)]

Here we found ourselves surrounded by a horde of savages who needed no
greasepaint to stain their ebony bodies, and many of whose grinning
countenances I had often recognized along our own Tenderloin.Besides,
there were cowboys and "greasers" and diving elks, and a company of
French Zouaves; the latter, in fact, seemed to be the only thing foreign
about the show.Our friend, the manager, informed us that he had thrown
the entire spectacle together in about ten days, and that he had
gathered with ease, in two, a hundred of those dusky warriors, who had
left their coat-room and barber-shop jobs in New York to find themselves
stranded in Paris.He was a hustler, this circus-man, and preceding the spectacle of the
African war, he had entertained the audience with a short variety-show,
to brace the spectacle.He insisted on bringing us around in front and
giving us a box, so we could see for ourselves how good it really was.During this forepart, and after some clever high trapeze work,
the sensation of the evening was announced--a Signore, with an
unpronounceable name, would train a den of ten forest-bred lions!When the orchestra had finished playing "The Awakening of the Lion," the
curtain rose, disclosing the nerveless Signore in purple tights and
high-topped boots.A long, portable cage had been put together on the
stage during the intermission, and within it the ten pacing beasts.There is something terrifying about the roar of a lion as it begins with
its high-keyed moan, and descends in scale to a hoarse roar that seems
to penetrate one's whole nervous system.But the Signore did not seem to mind it; he placed one foot on the sill
of the safety-door, tucked his short riding-whip under his arm, pulled
the latch with one hand, forced one knee in the slightly opened door,
and sprang into the cage.went the iron door as it found its
lock.went the Signore's revolver, as he drove the snarling,
roaring lot into the corner of the cage.The smoke from his revolver
drifted out through the bars; the house was silent.The trainer walked
slowly up to the fiercest lion, who reared against the bars as he
approached him, striking at the trainer with his heavy paws, while the
others slunk into the opposite corner.The man's head was but half a
foot now from the lion's; he menaced the beast with the little
riding-whip; he almost, but did not quite strike him on the tip of his
black nose that worked convulsively in rage.Then the lion dropped
awkwardly, with a short growl, to his forelegs, and slunk, with the
rest, into the corner.It was the little
riding-whip they feared, for they had never gauged its sting.Not the
heavy iron bar within reach of his hand, whose force they knew."An ugly lot," I said, turning to our friend the manager, who had taken
his seat beside me."Yes," he mused, peering at the stage with his keen gray eyes; "green
stock, but a swell act, eh?I've got a
girl here who comes on and does art poses among the lions; she's a
dream--French, too!"A girl of perhaps twenty, enveloped in a bath gown, now appeared at the
wings.The next instant the huge theater became dark, and she stood in
full fleshings, in the center of the cage, brilliant in the rays of a
powerful limelight, while the lions circled about her at the command of
the trainer."Yes," said I, "she is.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

"No, she never worked with the cats before," he said; "she's new to the
show business; she said her folks live in Nantes.She worked here in a
chocolate factory until she saw my 'ad' last week and joined my show.We
gave her a rehearsal Monday and we put her on the bill next night.She's
a good looker with plenty of grit, and is a winner with the bunch in
front.""How did you get her to take the job?""Well," he replied, "she balked at the act at first, but I showed her
two violet notes from a couple of swell fairies who wanted the job, and
after that she signed for six weeks."he exclaimed dryly, and he bit the corner of his stubby
mustache and smiled."This is the last act in the olio, so you will have
to excuse me.*     *     *     *     *

There are streets and boulevards in the Quarter, sections of which are
alive with the passing throng and the traffic of carts and omnibuses.Then one will come to a long stretch of massive buildings, public
institutions, silent as convents--their interminable walls flanking
garden or court.Germain is just such a highway until it crosses the
Boulevard St.Michel--the liveliest roadway of the Quarter.Then it
seems to become suddenly inoculated with its bustle and life, and from
there on is crowded with bourgeoise and animated with the commerce of
market and shop.An Englishman once was so fired with a desire to see the gay life of the
Latin Quarter that he rented a suite of rooms on this same Boulevard St.Germain at about the middle of this long, quiet stretch.Here he stayed
a fortnight, expecting daily to see from his "chambers" the gaiety of a
Bohemia of which he had so often heard.At the end of his disappointing
sojourn, he returned to London, firmly convinced that the gay life of
the Latin Quarter was a myth.[Illustration: (crowded street market)]

But the man from Denver, the "Steel King," and the two thinner
gentlemen with the louis-lined waistcoats who accompanied him and whom
Fortune had awakened in the far West one morning and had led them to
"The Great Red Star copper mine"--a find which had ever since been a
source of endless amusement to them--discovered the Quarter before they
had been in Paris a day, and found it, too, "the best ever," as they
expressed it.They did not remain long in Paris, this rare crowd of seasoned genials,
for it was their first trip abroad and they had to see Switzerland and
Vienna, and the Rhine; but while they stayed they had a good time Every
Minute.The man from Denver and the Steel King sat at one of the small tables,
leaning over the railing at the "Bal Bullier," gazing at the sea of
dancers."Billy," said the man from Denver to the Steel King, "if they had this
in Chicago they'd tear out the posts inside of fifteen minutes"--he
wiped the perspiration from his broad forehead and pushed his
twenty-dollar Panama on the back of his head.he mused, clinching the butt of his perfecto between
his teeth.it beats all I ever see," and he chuckled to
himself, his round, genial face, with its double chin, wreathed in
smiles.he called to one of the 'copper twins,' "did you get on
to that little one in black that just went by--well!Already the pile of saucers on their table reached a foot high--a record
of refreshments for every Yvonne and Marcelle that had stopped in
passing."Certainly, sit right down," cried the Steel King."Here, Jack,"--this
to the aged garcon, "smoke up!and ask the ladies what they'll
have"--all of which was unintelligible to the two little Parisiennes and
the garcon, but quite clear in meaning to all three.interrupted the taller of the two girls, "un cafe
glace pour moi.""Et moi," answered her companion gayly, "Je prends une limonade!"thundered good-humoredly the man from Denver; "git 'em
a good drink.yes, that's it--whiskey--I see you're on,
and two.he explains, holding up two fat fingers, "all straight,
friend--two whiskeys with seltzer on the side--see?Now go roll your
hoop and git back with 'em.""Oh, non, monsieur!"cried the two Parisiennes in one breath; "whiskey!ca pique et c'est trop fort."At this juncture the flower woman arrived with a basketful of red roses."Voulez-vous des fleurs, messieurs et mesdames?""Certainly," cried the Steel King; "here, Maud and Mamie, take the lot,"
and he handed the two girls the entire contents of the basket.The
taller buried her face for a moment in the red Jaqueminots and drank in
their fragrance.When she looked up, two big tears trickled down to the
corners of her pretty mouth.The
smaller girl gave a little cry of delight and shook her roses above her
head as three other girls passed.Ten minutes later the two possessed
but a single rose apiece--they had generously given all the rest away.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

The "copper twins" had been oblivious of all this.They had been hanging
over the low balustrade, engaged in a heart-to-heart talk with two
pretty Quartier brunettes.It seemed to be really a case of love at
first sight, carried on somewhat under difficulties, for the "copper
twins" could not speak a word of French, and the English of the two chic
brunettes was limited to "Oh, yes!""Good morning," "Good
evening," and "I love you."The four held hands over the low railing,
until the "copper twins" fairly steamed in talk; warmed by the sun of
gaiety and wet by several rounds of Highland dew, they grew sad and
earnest, and got up and stepped all over the Steel King and the man from
Denver, and the two Parisiennes' daintily slippered feet, in squeezing
out past the group of round tables back of the balustrade, and down on
to the polished floor--where they are speedily lost to view in the maze
of dancers, gliding into the whirl with the two brunettes.When the
waltz is over they stroll out with them into the garden, and order wine,
and talk of changing their steamer date.The good American, with his spotless collar and his well-cut clothes,
with his frankness and whole-souled generosity, is a study to the modern
grisette.He seems strangely attractive to her, in contrast with a
certain type of Frenchman, that is selfish, unfaithful, and mean--that
jealousy makes uncompanionable and sometimes cruel.She will tell you
that these pale, black-eyed, and black-bearded boulevardiers are all
alike--lazy and selfish; so unlike many of the sterling, good fellows of
the Quarter--Frenchmen of a different stamp, and there are many of
these--rare, good Bohemians, with hearts and natures as big as all
out-doors--"bons garcons," which is only another way of saying
"gentlemen."As you tramp along back to your quarters some rainy night you find many
of the streets leading from the boulevards silent and badly lighted,
except for some flickering lantern on the corner of a long block which
sends the shadows scurrying across your path.You pass a student perhaps
and a girl, hurrying home--a fiacre for a short distance is a luxury in
the Quarter.Now you hear the click-clock of an approaching cab, the
cocher half asleep on his box.The hood of the fiacre is up, sheltering
the two inside from the rain.As the voiture rumbles by near a
street-light, you catch a glimpse of a pink silk petticoat within and a
pair of dainty, white kid shoes--and the glint of an officer's sword.Farther on, you pass a silent gendarme muffled in his night cloak; a few
doors farther on in a small cafe, a bourgeois couple, who have arrived
on a late train no doubt to spend a month with relatives in Paris, are
having a warming tipple before proceeding farther in the drizzling rain.They have, of course, invited the cocher to drink with them.They have
brought all their pets and nearly all their household goods--two dogs,
three bird-cages, their tiny occupants protected from the damp air by
several folds of newspaper; a cat in a stout paper box with air holes,
and two trunks, well tied with rope.[Illustration: (street market)]

"Ah, yes, it has been a long journey!"Her husband
corroborates her, as they explain to the patronne of the cafe and to the
cocher that they left their village at midday.Anything over two hours
on the chemin-de-fer is considered a journey by these good French
people!As you continue on to your studio, you catch a glimpse of the lights of
the Boulevard Montparnasse.Next a cab with a green light rattles by;
then a ponderous two-wheeled cart lumbers along, piled high with red
carrots as neatly arranged as cigars in a box--the driver asleep on his
seat near his swinging lantern--and the big Normandy horses taking the
way.It is late, for these carts are on their route to the early morning
market--one of the great Halles.The tired waiters are putting up the
shutters of the smaller cafes and stacking up the chairs.Now a cock
crows lustily in some neighboring yard; the majority at least of the
Latin Quarter has turned in for the night.A moment later you reach your
gate, feel instinctively for your matches.In the darkness of the court
a friendly cat rubs her head contentedly against your leg.It is the
yellow one that sleeps in the furniture factory, and you pick her up and
carry her to your studio, where, a moment later, she is crunching
gratefully the remnant of the beau maquereau left from your
dejeuner--for charity begins at home.CHAPTER X

EXILED


Scores of men, celebrated in art and in literature, have, for a longer
or shorter period of their lives, been bohemians of the Latin Quarter.And yet these years spent in cafes and in studios have not turned them
out into the world a devil-me-care lot of dreamers.They have all
marched and sung along the "Boul' Miche"; danced at the "Bullier";
starved, struggled, and lived in the romance of its life.It has all
been a part of their education, and a very important part too, in the
development of their several geniuses, a development which in later life
has placed them at the head of their professions.These years of
camaraderie--of a life free from all conventionalities, in daily touch
with everything about them, and untrammeled by public censure or the
petty views of prudish or narrow minds, have left them free to cut a
straight swath merrily toward the goal of their ideals, surrounded all
the while by an atmosphere of art and good-fellowship that permeates the
very air they breathe.If a man can work at all, he can work here, for between the
working-hours he finds a life so charming, that once having lived
it he returns to it again and again, as to an old love.How many are the romances of this student Quarter!How many hearts have
been broken or made glad!How many brave spirits have suffered and
worked on and suffered again, and at last won fame!We who come with a fresh eye know nothing of all that has passed
within these quaint streets--only those who have lived in and through it
know its full story.[Illustration: THE MUSEE CLUNY]

Pochard has seen it; so has the little old woman who once danced at the
opera; so have old Bibi La Puree, and Alphonse, the gray-haired garcon,
and Mere Gaillard, the flower-woman.They have seen the gay boulevards
and the cafes and generations of grisettes, from the true grisette of
years gone by, in her dainty white cap and simple dress turned low at
the throat, to the tailor-made grisette of to-day.Yet the eyes of the little old woman still dance; they have not grown
tired of this ever-changing kaleidoscope of human nature, this paradise
of the free, where many would rather struggle on half starved than live
a life of luxury elsewhere.I knew one once who lived in an
air-castle of his own building--a tall, serious fellow, a sculptor, who
always went tramping about in a robe resembling a monk's cowl, with his
bare feet incased in coarse sandals; only his art redeemed these
eccentricities, for he produced in steel and ivory the most exquisite
statuettes.One at the Salon was the sensation of the day--a knight in
full armor, scarcely half a foot in height, holding in his arms a nymph
in flesh-tinted ivory, whose gentle face, upturned, gazed sweetly into
the stern features behind the uplifted vizor; and all so exquisitely
carved, so alive, so human, that one could almost feel the tender heart
of this fair lady beating against the cold steel breastplate.Another "bon garcon"--a painter whose enthusiasm for his art knew no
bounds--craved to produce a masterpiece.This dreamer could be seen
daily ferreting around the Quarter for a studio always bigger than the
one he had.At last he found one that exactly fitted the requirements of
his vivid imagination--a studio with a ceiling thirty feet high, with
windows like the scenic ones next to the stage entrances of the
theaters.Here at last he could give full play to his brush--no subject
seemed too big for him to tackle; he would move in a canvas as big as a
back flat to a third act, and commence on a "Fall of Babylon" or a
"Carnage of Rome" with a nerve that was sublime!The choking dust of the
arena--the insatiable fury of the tigers--the cowering of hundreds of
unfortunate captives--and the cruel multitude above, seated in the vast
circle of the hippodrome--all these did not daunt his zeal.Once he persuaded a venerable old abbe to pose for his portrait.The
old gentleman came patiently to his studio and posed for ten days, at
the end of which time the abbe gazed at the result and said things which
I dare not repeat--for our enthusiast had so far only painted his
clothes; the face was still in its primary drawing."The face I shall do in time," the enthusiast assured the reverend man
excitedly; "it is the effect of the rich color of your robe I wished to
get.And may I ask your holiness to be patient a day longer while I put
in your boots?""Does monsieur think I am not a
very busy man?"Then softening a little, he said, with a smile:

"I won't come any more, my friend.I'll send my boots around to-morrow
by my boy."But the longest red-letter day has its ending, and time and tide beckon
one with the brutality of an impatient jailer.On my studio table is a well-stuffed envelope containing the documents
relative to my impending exile--a stamped card of my identification,
bearing the number of my cell, a plan of the slave-ship, and six red
tags for my baggage.The three pretty daughters of old Pere Valois know of my approaching
departure, and say cheering things to me as I pass the concierge's
window.Pere Valois stands at the gate and stops me with: "Is it true, monsieur,
you are going Saturday?""Yes," I answer; "unfortunately, it is quite true."The old man sighs and replies: "I once had to leave Paris myself";
looking at me as if he were speaking to an old resident."My regiment
was ordered to the colonies.It was hard, monsieur, but I did my duty."The patron of the tobacco-shop,
and madame his good wife, and the wine merchant, and the baker along the
little street with its cobblestone-bed, have all wished me "bon voyage,"
accompanied with many handshakings.It is getting late and Pere Valois
has gone to hunt for a cab--a "galerie," as it is called, with a place
for trunks on top.Twenty minutes go by, but no "galerie" is in sight.The three daughters of Pere Valois run in different directions to find
one, while I throw the remaining odds and ends in the studio into my
valise.At last there is a sound of grating wheels below on the gravel
court.The "galerie" has arrived--with the smallest of the three
daughters inside, all out of breath from her run and terribly excited.There are the trunks and the valises and the bicycle in its crate to get
down.Two soldiers, who have been calling on two of the daughters, come
up to the studio and kindly offer their assistance.There is no time to
lose, and in single file the procession starts down the atelier stairs,
headed by Pere Valois, who has just returned from his fruitless search
considerably winded, and the three girls, the two red-trousered soldiers
and myself tugging away at the rest of the baggage.It is not often one departs with the assistance of three pretty femmes
de menage, a jolly old concierge, and a portion of the army of the
French Republic.With many suggestions from my good friends and an
assuring wave of the hand from the aged cocher, my luggage is roped and
chained to the top of the rickety, little old cab, which sways and
squeaks with the sudden weight, while the poor, small horse, upon whom
has been devolved the task of making the 11.35 train, Gare St.Lazare,
changes his position wearily from one leg to the other.He is evidently
thinking out the distance, and has decided upon his gait.cry the three girls and Pere Valois and the two soldiers,
as the last trunk is chained on.The dingy vehicle groans its way slowly out of the court.Just as it
reaches the last gate it stops.I ask, poking my head out of the window."Monsieur," says the aged cocher, "it is an impossibility!I regret very
much to say that your bicycle will not pass through the gate."A dozen heads in the windows above offer suggestions.I climb out and
take a look; there are at least four inches to spare on either side in
passing through the iron posts.cries my cocher enthusiastically, "monsieur is right, happily for
us!"He cracks his whip, the little horse gathers itself together--a moment
of careful driving and we are through and into the street and rumbling
away, amid cheers from the windows above.As I glance over my traps, I
see a small bunch of roses tucked in the corner of my roll of rugs with
an engraved card attached."From Mademoiselle Ernestine Valois," it
reads, and on the other side is written, in a small, fine hand, "Bon
voyage."I look back to bow my acknowledgment, but it is too late; we have turned
the corner and the rue Vaugirard is but a memory!*     *     *     *     *

But why go on telling you of what the little shops contain--how narrow
and picturesque are the small streets--how gay the boulevards--what they
do at the "Bullier"--or where they dine?It is Love that moves Paris--it
is the motive power of this big, beautiful, polished city--the love of
adventure, the love of intrigue, the love of being a bohemian if you
will--but it is Love all the same!"I work for love," hums the little couturiere."I work for love," cries the miller of Marcel Legay."I live for love," sings the poet."For the love of art I am a painter," sighs Edmond, in his atelier--"and
for her!""For the love of it I mold and model and create," chants the
sculptor--"and for her!"It is the Woman who dominates Paris--"Les petites femmes!"who have
inspired its art through the skill of these artisans.cries a poor old
woman outside of your train compartment, as you are leaving Havre for
Paris.screams a girl, running near the open window with a little
fishergirl doll uplifted.I see," cries the
pretty vendor; "but it is a boy doll--he will be sad if he goes to
Paris without a companion!"Take all the little fishergirls away from Paris--from the Quartier
Latin--and you would find chaos and a morgue!that is it--L'amour!--L'amour!--L'amour![Illustration: (burning candle)]

out there.I thought I'd get a little house somewhere and adopt a baby
maybe, or get something to do."That isn't a bad idea," he said, "that of adopting a baby.It
would be a lot of company for you.You know how to go about getting
one?""You just ask at one of these asylums, don't you?""I think there's something more than that," he replied
thoughtfully."There are some formalities--I don't know what they
are.They try to keep control of the child in some way.You had better
consult with Watson and get him to help you.Pick out your baby, and
then let him do the rest.Lester saw that she needed companionship badly."He's in Rochester, but he couldn't come.Bass said he was
married," she added."There isn't any other member of the family you could persuade to
come and live with you?""I might get William, but I don't know where he is.""Why not try that new section west of Jackson Park," he suggested,
"if you want a house here in Chicago?I see some nice cottages out
that way.Just rent until you see how well you're
satisfied."Jennie thought this good advice because it came from Lester.It was
good of him to take this much interest in her affairs.She wasn't
entirely separated from him after all.She asked
him how his wife was, whether he had had a pleasant trip, whether he
was going to stay in Chicago.All the while he was thinking that he
had treated her badly.He went to the window and looked down into
Dearborn Street, the world of traffic below holding his attention.The
great mass of trucks and vehicles, the counter streams of hurrying
pedestrians, seemed like a puzzle.It was
growing dusk, and lights were springing up here and there."I want to tell you something, Jennie," said Lester, finally
rousing himself from his fit of abstraction."I may seem peculiar to
you, after all that has happened, but I still care for you--in my
way.I've thought of you right along since I left.I thought it good
business to leave you--the way things were.I thought I liked
Letty well enough to marry her.From one point of view it still seems
best, but I'm not so much happier.I was just as happy with you as I
ever will be.It isn't myself that's important in this transaction
apparently; the individual doesn't count much in the situation.I
don't know whether you see what I'm driving at, but all of us are more
or less pawns.We're moved about like chessmen by circumstances over
which we have no control.""After all, life is more or less of a farce," he went on a little
bitterly.The best we can do is to hold our
personality intact.It doesn't appear that integrity has much to do
with it."Jennie did not quite grasp what he was talking about, but she knew
it meant that he was not entirely satisfied with himself and was sorry
for her."Don't worry over me, Lester," she consoled."I'm all right; I'll
get along.It did seem terrible to me for a while--getting used
to being alone."I want you to feel that my attitude hasn't changed," he continued
eagerly.Mrs.--Letty
understands that.When you get settled I'll
come in and see how you're fixed.I'll come around here again in a few
days.You understand how I feel, don't you?"He took her hand, turning it sympathetically in his own."Don't
worry," he said."I don't want you to do that.You're still Jennie to me, if you don't mind.I'm pretty bad, but I'm
not all bad."You probably are happy since--"

"Now, Jennie," he interrupted; then he pressed affectionately her
hand, her arm, her shoulder."Want to kiss me for old times' sake?"She put her hands over his shoulders, looked long into his eyes,
then kissed him.Jennie saw his agitation, and tried hard to speak."You'd better go now," she said firmly.He went away, and yet he knew that he wanted above all things to
remain; she was still the one woman in the world for him.And Jennie
felt comforted even though the separation still existed in all its
finality.She did not endeavor to explain or adjust the moral and
ethical entanglements of the situation.She was not, like so many,
endeavoring to put the ocean into a tea-cup, or to tie up the shifting
universe in a mess of strings called law.Lester still cared for her a
little.She had hoped once
that he might want her only.Since he did not, was his affection worth
nothing?She could not think, she could not feel that.CHAPTER LX


The drift of events for a period of five years carried Lester and
Jennie still farther apart; they settled naturally into their
respective spheres, without the renewal of the old time relationship
which their several meetings at the Tremont at first seemed to
foreshadow.Lester was in the thick of social and commercial affairs;
he walked in paths to which Jennie's retiring soul had never aspired.Jennie's own existence was quiet and uneventful.There was a simple
cottage in a very respectable but not showy neighborhood near Jackson
Park, on the South Side, where she lived in retirement with a little
foster-child--a chestnut-haired girl taken from the Western Home
for the Friendless--as her sole companion.J. G. Stover, for she had deemed it best to abandon the name of
Kane.Lester Kane when resident in Chicago were the
occupants of a handsome mansion on the Lake Shore Drive, where
parties, balls, receptions, dinners were given in rapid and at times
almost pyrotechnic succession.Lester, however, had become in his way a lover of a peaceful and
well-entertained existence.He had cut from his list of acquaintances
and associates a number of people who had been a little doubtful or
overfamiliar or indifferent or talkative during a certain period which
to him was a memory merely.He was a director, and in several cases
the chairman of a board of directors, in nine of the most important
financial and commercial organizations of the West--The United
Traction Company of Cincinnati, The Western Crucible Company, The
United Carriage Company, The Second National Bank of Chicago, the
First National Bank of Cincinnati, and several others of equal
importance.He was never a personal factor in the affairs of The
United Carriage Company, preferring to be represented by
counsel--Mr.Dwight L. Watson, but he took a keen interest in its
affairs.He had not seen his brother Robert to speak to him in seven
years.He had not seen Imogene, who lived in Chicago, in three.Louise, Amy, their husbands, and some of their closest acquaintances
were practically strangers.The firm of Knight, Keatley & O'Brien
had nothing whatever to do with his affairs.The truth was that Lester, in addition to becoming a little
phlegmatic, was becoming decidedly critical in his outlook on life.He
could not make out what it was all about.In distant ages a queer
thing had come to pass.There had started on its way in the form of
evolution a minute cellular organism which had apparently reproduced
itself by division, had early learned to combine itself with others,
to organize itself into bodies, strange forms of fish, animals, and
birds, and had finally learned to organize itself into man.Man, on
his part, composed as he was of self-organizing cells, was pushing
himself forward into comfort and different aspects of existence by
means of union and organization with other men.Here he was endowed with a peculiar brain and a certain amount of
talent, and he had inherited a certain amount of wealth which he now
scarcely believed he deserved, only luck had favored him.But he could
not see that any one else might be said to deserve this wealth any
more than himself, seeing that his use of it was as conservative and
constructive and practical as the next one's.He might have been born
poor, in which case he would have been as well satisfied as the next
one--not more so.Why should he complain, why worry, why
speculate?--the world was going steadily forward of its own
volition, whether he would or no.And was there any need
for him to disturb himself about it?He fancied at
times that it might as well never have been started at all."The one
divine, far-off event" of the poet did not appeal to him as having any
basis in fact.Lester Kane was of very much the same opinion.Jennie, living on the South Side with her adopted child, Rose
Perpetua, was of no fixed conclusion as to the meaning of life.She
had not the incisive reasoning capacity of either Mr.She had seen a great deal, suffered a great deal, and had read
some in a desultory way.Her mind had never grasped the nature and
character of specialized knowledge.History, physics, chemistry,
botany, geology, and sociology were not fixed departments in her brain
as they were in Lester's and Letty's.Instead there was the feeling
that the world moved in some strange, unstable way.Apparently no one
knew clearly what it was all about.Some
believed that the world had been made six thousand years before; some
that it was millions of years old.Was it all blind chance, or was
there some guiding intelligence--a God?Almost in spite of
herself she felt there must be something--a higher power which
produced all the beautiful things--the flowers, the stars, the
trees, the grass.If at times life seemed
cruel, yet this beauty still persisted.The thought comforted her; she
fed upon it in her hours of secret loneliness.It has been said that Jennie was naturally of an industrious turn.She liked to be employed, though she thought constantly as she worked.She was of matronly proportions in these days--not disagreeably
large, but full bodied, shapely, and smooth-faced in spite of her
cares.Her hair was still of a rich
brown, but there were traces of gray in it.Her neighbors spoke of her
as sweet-tempered, kindly, and hospitable.They knew nothing of her
history, except that she had formerly resided in Sandwood, and before
that in Cleveland.She was very reticent as to her past.Jennie had fancied, because of her natural aptitude for taking care
of sick people, that she might get to be a trained nurse.But she was
obliged to abandon that idea, for she found that only young people
were wanted.She also thought that some charitable organization might
employ her, but she did not understand the new theory of charity which
was then coming into general acceptance and practice--namely,
only to help others to help themselves.She believed in giving, and
was not inclined to look too closely into the credentials of those who
asked for help; consequently her timid inquiry at one relief agency
after another met with indifference, if not unqualified rebuke.She
finally decided to adopt another child for Rose Perpetua's sake; she
succeeded in securing a boy, four years old, who was known as
Henry--Henry Stover.Her support was assured, for her income was
paid to her through a trust company.She had no desire for speculation
or for the devious ways of trade.The care of flowers, the nature of
children, the ordering of a home were more in her province.One of the interesting things in connection with this separation
once it had been firmly established related to Robert and Lester, for
these two since the reading of the will a number of years before had
never met.He had followed
his success since he had left Jennie with interest.Gerald with pleasure; he had always considered her an
ideal companion for his brother.He knew by many signs and tokens that
his brother, since the unfortunate termination of their father's
attitude and his own peculiar movements to gain control of the Kane
Company, did not like him.Still they had never been so far apart
mentally--certainly not in commercial judgment.Lester was
prosperous now.And after all, he had done his best to aid his brother to
come to his senses--and with the best intentions.There were
mutual interests they could share financially if they were friends.He
wondered from time to time if Lester would not be friendly with
him.Time passed, and then once, when he was in Chicago, he made the
friends with whom he was driving purposely turn into the North Shore
in order to see the splendid mansion which the Kanes occupied.He knew
its location from hearsay and description.When he saw it a touch of the old Kane home atmosphere came back to
him.Lester in revising the property after purchase had had a
conservatory built on one side not unlike the one at home in
Cincinnati.That same night he sat down and wrote Lester asking if he
would not like to dine with him at the Union Club.He was only in town
for a day or two, and he would like to see him again.There was some
feeling he knew, but there was a proposition he would like to talk to
him about.On the receipt of this letter Lester frowned and fell into a brown
study.He had never really been healed of the wound that his father
had given him.He had never been comfortable in his mind since Robert
had deserted him so summarily.He realized now that the stakes his
brother had been playing for were big.But, after all, he had been his
brother, and if he had been in Robert's place at the time, he would
not have done as he had done; at least he hoped not.Then he thought he would
write and say no.But a curious desire to see Robert again, to hear
what he had to say, to listen to the proposition he had to offer, came
over him; he decided to write yes.They might agree to let by-gones be by-gones, but
the damage had been done.Could a broken bowl be mended and called
whole?It might be called whole, but what of it?He wrote and intimated that he would come.On the Thursday in question Robert called up from the Auditorium to
remind him of the engagement.Lester listened curiously to the sound
of his voice."All right," he said, "I'll be with you."At noon he
went down-town, and there, within the exclusive precincts of the Union
Club, the two brothers met and looked at each other again.Robert was
thinner than when Lester had seen him last, and a little grayer.His
eyes were bright and steely, but there were crow's-feet on either
side.Lester was noticeably of
another type--solid, brusque, and indifferent.Men spoke of
Lester these days as a little hard.Robert's keen blue eyes did not
disturb him in the least--did not affect him in any way.He saw
his brother just as he was, for he had the larger philosophic and
interpretative insight; but Robert could not place Lester exactly.He
could not fathom just what had happened to him in these years.Lester
was stouter, not gray, for some reason, but sandy and ruddy, looking
like a man who was fairly well satisfied to take life as he found it.Lester looked at his brother with a keen, steady eye.The latter
shifted a little, for he was restless.He could see that there was no
loss of that mental force and courage which had always been
predominant characteristics in Lester's make-up."I thought I'd like to see you again, Lester," Robert remarked,
after they had clasped hands in the customary grip."It's been a long
time now--nearly eight years, hasn't it?"I don't
often go to bed with anything."We don't see much of Ralph and Berenice since they married, but
the others are around more or less.I suppose your wife is all right,"
he said hesitatingly.Lester eyed him without a change of expression.They drifted mentally for a few moments, while Lester inquired
after the business, and Amy, Louise, and Imogene.He admitted frankly
that he neither saw nor heard from them nowadays."The thing that I was thinking of in connection with you, Lester,"
said Robert finally, "is this matter of the Western Crucible Steel
Company.You haven't been sitting there as a director in person I
notice, but your attorney, Watson, has been acting for you.The management isn't right--we all know that.We need
a practical steel man at the head of it, if the thing is ever going to
pay properly.I have voted my stock with yours right along because the
propositions made by Watson have been right.He agrees with me that
things ought to be changed.Now I have a chance to buy seventy shares
held by Rossiter's widow.That with yours and mine would give us
control of the company.I would like to have you take them, though it
doesn't make a bit of difference so long as it's in the family.You
can put any one you please in for president, and we'll make the thing
come out right."Watson had told him
that Robert's interests were co-operating with him.Lester had long
suspected that Robert would like to make up.This was the olive
branch--the control of a property worth in the neighborhood of a
million and a half."That's very nice of you," said Lester solemnly."It's a rather
liberal thing to do."Well, to tell you the honest truth, Lester," replied Robert, "I
never did feel right about that will business.I never did feel right
about that secretary-treasurership and some other things that have
happened.I don't want to rake up the past--you smile at
that--but I can't help telling you how I feel.I've been pretty
ambitious in the past.I was pretty ambitious just about the time that
father died to get this United Carriage scheme under way, and I was
afraid you might not like it.I have thought since that I ought not to
have done it, but I did.I suppose you're not anxious to hear any more
about that old affair.This other thing though--"

"Might be handed out as a sort of compensation," put in Lester
quietly."Not exactly that, Lester--though it may have something of
that in it.I know these things don't matter very much to you now.I
know that the time to do things was years ago--not now.Still I
thought sincerely that you might be interested in this proposition.Frankly, I thought it might patch up
matters between us."Yes," said Lester, "we're brothers."He was thinking as he said this of the irony of the situation.How
much had this sense of brotherhood been worth in the past?Robert had
practically forced him into his present relationship, and while Jennie
had been really the only one to suffer, he could not help feeling
angry.It was true that Robert had not cut him out of his one-fourth
of his father's estate, but certainly he had not helped him to get it,
and now Robert was thinking that this offer of his might mend things.It hurt him--Lester--a little."I can't see it, Robert," he said finally and determinedly."I can
appreciate the motive that prompts you to make this offer.But I can't
see the wisdom of my taking it.We can make all the changes you suggest if you take
the stock.I'm perfectly
willing to talk with you from time to time.This
other thing is simply a sop with which to plaster an old wound.You
want my friendship and so far as I'm concerned you have that.I don't
hold any grudge against you.He admired Lester in
spite of all that he had done to him--in spite of all that Lester
was doing to him now."I don't know but what you're right, Lester," he admitted finally."I didn't make this offer in any petty spirit though.I wanted to
patch up this matter of feeling between us.I won't say anything more
about it.You're not coming down to Cincinnati soon, are you?""I don't expect to," replied Lester."If you do I'd like to have you come and stay with us."I'll be glad to," he said, without emotion.But he remembered that
in the days of Jennie it was different.They would never have receded
from their position regarding her."Well," he thought, "perhaps I
can't blame them."I'll have to leave you soon," he said, looking at his
watch."I ought to go, too," said Robert."Well, anyhow," he
added, as they walked toward the cloakroom, "we won't be absolute
strangers in the future, will we?""I'll see you from time to time."There was a sense of
unsatisfied obligation and some remorse in Robert's mind as he saw his
brother walking briskly away.Why was it that
there was so much feeling between them--had been even before
Jennie had appeared?Then he remembered his old thoughts about "snaky
deeds."That was what his brother lacked, and that only.He was not
crafty; not darkly cruel, hence.On his part Lester went away feeling a slight sense of opposition
to, but also of sympathy for, his brother.He was not so terribly
bad--not different from other men.What would he
have done if he had been in Robert's place?He could see now how it all came about--why he had
been made the victim, why his brother had been made the keeper of the
great fortune."It's the way the world runs," he thought.CHAPTER LXI


The days of man under the old dispensation, or, rather, according
to that supposedly biblical formula, which persists, are threescore
years and ten.It is so ingrained in the race-consciousness by
mouth-to-mouth utterance that it seems the profoundest of truths.As a
matter of fact, man, even under his mortal illusion, is organically
built to live five times the period of his maturity, and would do so
if he but knew that it is spirit which endures, that age is an
illusion, and that there is no death.Yet the race-thought, gained
from what dream of materialism we know not, persists, and the death of
man under the mathematical formula so fearfully accepted is daily
registered.Lester was one of those who believed in this formula.He thought he had, say, twenty years more at the utmost
to live--perhaps not so long.No complaint or resistance would issue from
him.Life, in most of its aspects, was a silly show anyhow.He admitted that it was mostly illusion--easily proved to be
so.That it might all be one he sometimes suspected.It was very much
like a dream in its composition truly--sometimes like a very bad
dream.All he had to sustain him in his acceptance of its reality from
hour to hour and day to day was apparent contact with this material
proposition and that--people, meetings of boards of directors,
individuals and organizations planning to do this and that, his wife's
social functions Letty loved him as a fine, grizzled example of a
philosopher.She admired, as Jennie had, his solid, determined,
phlegmatic attitude in the face of troubled circumstance.All the
winds of fortune or misfortune could not apparently excite or disturb
Lester.He refused to budge from his
beliefs and feelings, and usually had to be pushed away from them,
still believing, if he were gotten away at all.He refused to do
anything save as he always said, "Look the facts in the face" and
fight.He could be made to fight easily enough if imposed upon, but
only in a stubborn, resisting way.His plan was to resist every effort
to coerce him to the last ditch.If he had to let go in the end he
would when compelled, but his views as to the value of not letting go
were quite the same even when he had let go under compulsion.His views of living were still decidedly material, grounded in
creature comforts, and he had always insisted upon having the best of
everything.If the furnishings of his home became the least dingy he
was for having them torn out and sold and the house done over.If he
traveled, money must go ahead of him and smooth the way.He did not
want argument, useless talk, or silly palaver as he called it.Every
one must discuss interesting topics with him or not talk at all.She would chuck him under the chin
mornings, or shake his solid head between her hands, telling him he
was a brute, but a nice kind of a brute."Yes, yes," he would growl.You're a seraphic suggestion of
attenuated thought.""No; you hush," she would reply, for at times he could cut like a
knife without really meaning to be unkind.Then he would pet her a
little, for, in spite of her vigorous conception of life, he realized
that she was more or less dependent upon him.It was always so plain
to her that he could get along without her.For reasons of kindliness
he was trying to conceal this, to pretend the necessity of her
presence, but it was so obvious that he really could dispense with her
easily enough.It was something, in
so shifty and uncertain a world, to be near so fixed and determined a
quantity as this bear-man.It was like being close to a warmly glowing
lamp in the dark or a bright burning fire in the cold.Lester was not
afraid of anything.He felt that he knew how to live and to die.It was natural that a temperament of this kind should have its
solid, material manifestation at every point.Having his financial
affairs well in hand, most of his holding being shares of big
companies, where boards of solemn directors merely approved the
strenuous efforts of ambitious executives to "make good," he had
leisure for living.He and Letty were fond of visiting the various
American and European watering-places.He gambled a little, for he
found that there was considerable diversion in risking interesting
sums on the spin of a wheel or the fortuitous roll of a ball; and he
took more and more to drinking, not in the sense that a drunkard takes
to it, but as a high liver, socially, and with all his friends.He was
inclined to drink the rich drinks when he did not take straight
whiskey--champagne, sparkling Burgundy, the expensive and
effervescent white wines.When he drank he could drink a great deal,
and he ate in proportion.Nothing must be served but the
best--soup, fish, entree, roast, game, dessert--everything
that made up a showy dinner and he had long since determined that only
a high-priced chef was worth while.They had found an old cordon
bleu, Louis Berdot, who had served in the house of one of the
great dry goods princes, and this man he engaged.He cost Lester a
hundred dollars a week, but his reply to any question was that he only
had one life to live.The trouble with this attitude was that it adjusted nothing,
improved nothing, left everything to drift on toward an indefinite
end.If Lester had married Jennie and accepted the comparatively
meager income of ten thousand a year he would have maintained the same
attitude to the end.It would have led him to a stolid indifference to
the social world of which now necessarily he was a part.He would have
drifted on with a few mentally compatible cronies who would have
accepted him for what he was--a good fellow--and Jennie in
the end would not have been so much better off than she was now.One of the changes which was interesting was that the Kanes
transferred their residence to New York.Kane had become very
intimate with a group of clever women in the Eastern four hundred, or
nine hundred, and had been advised and urged to transfer the scene of
her activities to New York.She finally did so, leasing a house in
Seventy-eighth Street, near Madison Avenue.She installed a novelty
for her, a complete staff of liveried servants, after the English
fashion, and had the rooms of her house done in correlative periods.Lester smiled at her vanity and love of show."You talk about your democracy," he grunted one day."You have as
much democracy as I have religion, and that's none at all."I'm merely accepting the logic of the situation."Do you call a butler and doorman in
red velvet a part of the necessity of the occasion?""Maybe not the necessity exactly,
but the spirit surely.You're the first one to
insist on perfection--to quarrel if there is any flaw in the
order of things.""Oh, I don't mean that literally.But you demand
perfection--the exact spirit of the occasion, and you know
it.""Maybe I do, but what has that to do with your democracy?"I'm as democratic in spirit as
any woman.Only I see things as they are, and conform as much as
possible for comfort's sake, and so do you.Don't you throw rocks at
my glass house, Mister Master.Yours is so transparent I can see every
move you make inside.""I'm democratic and you're not," he teased; but he approved
thoroughly of everything she did.She was, he sometimes fancied, a
better executive in her world than he was in his.Drifting in this fashion, wining, dining, drinking the waters of
this curative spring and that, traveling in luxurious ease and taking
no physical exercise, finally altered his body from a vigorous,
quick-moving, well-balanced organism into one where plethora of
substance was clogging every essential function.His liver, kidneys,
spleen, pancreas--every organ, in fact--had been overtaxed
for some time to keep up the process of digestion and elimination.In
the past seven years he had become uncomfortably heavy.His kidneys
were weak, and so were the arteries of his brain.By dieting, proper
exercise, the right mental attitude, he might have lived to be eighty
or ninety.As a matter of fact, he was allowing himself to drift into
a physical state in which even a slight malady might prove dangerous.It so happened that he and Letty had gone to the North Cape on a
cruise with a party of friends.Lester, in order to attend to some
important business, decided to return to Chicago late in November; he
arranged to have his wife meet him in New York just before the
Christmas holidays.He wrote Watson to expect him, and engaged rooms
at the Auditorium, for he had sold the Chicago residence some two
years before and was now living permanently in New York.One late November day, after having attended to a number of details
and cleared up his affairs very materially, Lester was seized with
what the doctor who was called to attend him described as a cold in
the intestines--a disturbance usually symptomatic of some other
weakness, either of the blood or of some organ.He suffered great
pain, and the usual remedies in that case were applied.There were
bandages of red flannel with a mustard dressing, and specifics were
also administered.He experienced some relief, but he was troubled
with a sense of impending disaster.He had Watson cable his
wife--there was nothing serious about it, but he was ill.A
trained nurse was in attendance and his valet stood guard at the door
to prevent annoyance of any kind.It was plain that Letty could not
reach Chicago under three weeks.He had the feeling that he would not
see her again.Curiously enough, not only because he was in Chicago, but because
he had never been spiritually separated from Jennie, he was thinking
about her constantly at this time.He had intended to go out and see
her just as soon as he was through with his business engagements and
before he left the city.He had asked Watson how she was getting
along, and had been informed that everything was well with her.She
was living quietly and looking in good health, so Watson said.Lester
wished he could see her.This thought grew as the days passed and he grew no better.He was
suffering from time to time with severe attacks of griping pains that
seemed to tie his viscera into knots, and left him very weak.Several
times the physician administered cocaine with a needle in order to
relieve him of useless pain.After one of the severe attacks he called Watson to his side, told
him to send the nurse away, and then said: "Watson, I'd like to have
you do me a favor.Stover if she won't come here to see me.Just send the nurse and Kozo (the valet)
away for the afternoon, or while she's here.If she comes at any other
time I'd like to have her admitted."He wondered what the world
would think if it could know of this bit of romance in connection with
so prominent a man.The latter was only too glad to serve him in any way.He called a carriage and rode out to Jennie's residence.He found
her watering some plants; her face expressed her surprise at his
unusual presence."I come on a rather troublesome errand, Mrs.Stover," he said,
using her assumed name.Kane is quite sick at
the Auditorium.His wife is in Europe, and he wanted to know if I
wouldn't come out here and ask you to come and see him.He wanted me
to bring you, if possible."Why yes," said Jennie, her face a study.An old Swedish housekeeper was in the kitchen.But there was coming back to her in detail a dream she
had had several nights before.It had seemed to her that she was out
on a dark, mystic body of water over which was hanging something like
a fog, or a pall of smoke.She heard the water ripple, or stir
faintly, and then out of the surrounding darkness a boat appeared.It
was a little boat, oarless, or not visibly propelled, and in it were
her mother, and Vesta, and some one whom she could not make out.Her
mother's face was pale and sad, very much as she had often seen it in
life.She looked at Jennie solemnly, sympathetically, and then
suddenly Jennie realized that the third occupant of the boat was
Lester.He looked at her gloomily--an expression she had never
seen on his face before--and then her mother remarked, "Well, we
must go now."The boat began to move, a great sense of loss came over
her, and she cried, "Oh, don't leave me, mamma!"But her mother only looked at her out of deep, sad, still eyes, and
the boat was gone.She woke with a start, half fancying that Lester was beside her.She stretched out her hand to touch his arm; then she drew herself up
in the dark and rubbed her eyes, realizing that she was alone.A great
sense of depression remained with her, and for two days it haunted
her.Then, when it seemed as if it were nothing, Mr.She went to dress, and reappeared, looking as troubled as were her
thoughts.She was very pleasing in her appearance yet, a sweet, kindly
woman, well dressed and shapely.She had never been separated mentally
from Lester, just as he had never grown entirely away from her.She
was always with him in thought, just as in the years when they were
together.Her fondest memories were of the days when he first courted
her in Cleveland--the days when he had carried her off, much as
the cave-man seized his mate--by force.Now she longed to do what
she could for him.For this call was as much a testimony as a shock.He loved her--he loved her, after all.The carriage rolled briskly through the long streets into the smoky
down-town district.It arrived at the Auditorium, and Jennie was
escorted to Lester's room.He had talked
little, leaving her to her thoughts.In this great hotel she felt
diffident after so long a period of complete retirement.As she
entered the room she looked at Lester with large, gray, sympathetic
eyes.He was lying propped up on two pillows, his solid head with its
growth of once dark brown hair slightly grayed.He looked at her
curiously out of his wise old eyes, a light of sympathy and affection
shining in them--weary as they were.His pale face, slightly drawn from suffering, cut her like
a knife.She took his hand, which was outside the coverlet, and
pressed it."I'm so sorry, Lester," she murmured.You're not
very sick though, are you?You must get well, Lester--and soon!""Yes, Jennie, but I'm pretty bad," he said."I don't feel right
about this business.I don't seem able to shake it off.But tell me,
how have you been?""Oh, just the same, dear," she replied.You mustn't
talk like that, though.You're going to be all right very soon
now."He shook his head, for he
thought differently."Sit down, dear," he went on, "I'm not worrying
about that.He
sighed and shut his eyes for a minute.She drew up a chair close beside the bed, her face toward his, and
took his hand.It seemed such a beautiful thing that he should send
for her.Her eyes showed the mingled sympathy, affection, and
gratitude of her heart.At the same time fear gripped her; how ill he
looked!"I can't tell what may happen," he went on.I've wanted to see you again for some time.We are living in New York, you know.You're a little stouter,
Jennie.""Yes, I'm getting old, Lester," she smiled."Oh, that doesn't make any difference," he replied, looking at her
fixedly.A slight twinge of pain
reminded him of the vigorous seizures he had been through.He couldn't
stand many more paroxysms like the last one."I couldn't go, Jennie, without seeing you again," he observed,
when the slight twinge ceased and he was free to think again."I've
always wanted to say to you, Jennie," he went on, "that I haven't been
satisfied with the way we parted.It wasn't the right thing, after
all.I wish now, for my own
peace of mind, that I hadn't done it.""Don't say that, Lester," she demurred, going over in her mind all
that had been between them.This was such a testimony to their real
union--their real spiritual compatibility.I wouldn't
have been satisfied to have you lose your fortune.I've been a lot better satisfied as it is.It's been hard, but,
dear, everything is hard at times."The thing wasn't worked out right
from the start; but that wasn't your fault.I'm glad I'm here to do it.""Don't talk that way, Lester--please don't," she pleaded.Why, when I think--" she
stopped, for it was hard for her to speak.She was choking with
affection and sympathy.She was recalling the
house he took for her family in Cleveland, his generous treatment of
Gerhardt, all the long ago tokens of love and kindness."Well, I've told you now, and I feel better.You're a good woman,
Jennie, and you're kind to come to me this way."It seems strange, but you're the
only woman I ever did love truly.It was the one thing she had waited for
all these years--this testimony.It was the one thing that could
make everything right--this confession of spiritual if not
material union."Oh, Lester,"
she exclaimed with a sob, and pressed his hand."Oh, they're lovely," she answered, entering upon a detailed
description of their diminutive personalities.He listened
comfortably, for her voice was soothing to him.When it came time for her to go he seemed
desirous of keeping her."I can stay just as well as not, Lester," she volunteered."You needn't do that," he said, but she could see that he wanted
her, that he did not want to be alone.From that time on until the hour of his death she was not out of
the hotel.CHAPTER LXII


The end came after four days during which Jennie was by his bedside
almost constantly.The nurse in charge welcomed her at first as a
relief and company, but the physician was inclined to object.Lester,
however, was stubborn."This is my death," he said, with a touch of
grim humor."If I'm dying I ought to be allowed to die in my own
way."Watson smiled at the man's unfaltering courage.He had never seen
anything like it before.There were cards of sympathy, calls of inquiry, notices in the
newspaper.Robert saw an item in the Inquirer and decided to go
to Chicago.Imogene called with her husband, and they were admitted to
Lester's room for a few minutes after Jennie had gone to hers.The nurse cautioned them that he was not to be
talked to much.When they were gone Lester said to Jennie, "Imogene
has changed a good deal."Kane was on the Atlantic three days out from New York the
afternoon Lester died.He had been meditating whether anything more
could be done for Jennie, but he could not make up his mind about it.Certainly it was useless to leave her more money.He had been wondering where Letty was and how near her actual arrival
might be when he was seized with a tremendous paroxysm of pain.Before
relief could be administered in the shape of an anesthetic he was
dead.It developed afterward that it was not the intestinal trouble
which killed him, but a lesion of a major blood-vessel in the
brain.Jennie, who had been strongly wrought up by watching and worrying,
was beside herself with grief.He had been a part of her thought and
feeling so long that it seemed now as though a part of herself had
died.She had loved him as she had fancied she could never love any
one, and he had always shown that he cared for her--at least in
some degree.She could not feel the emotion that expresses itself in
tears--only a dull ache, a numbness which seemed to make her
insensible to pain.He looked so strong--her Lester--lying
there still in death.His expression was unchanged--defiant,
determined, albeit peaceful.Kane that she
would arrive on the Wednesday following.Watson that it was to be transferred to
Cincinnati, where the Paces had a vault.Because of the arrival of
various members of the family, Jennie withdrew to her own home; she
could do nothing more.The final ceremonies presented a peculiar commentary on the
anomalies of existence.Kane by wire that
the body should be transferred to Imogene's residence, and the funeral
held from there.Robert, who arrived the night Lester died; Berry
Dodge, Imogene's husband; Mr.Midgely, and three other citizens of
prominence were selected as pall-bearers.Louise and her husband came
from Buffalo; Amy and her husband from Cincinnati.The house was full
to overflowing with citizens who either sincerely wished or felt it
expedient to call.Because of the fact that Lester and his family were
tentatively Catholic, a Catholic priest was called in and the ritual
of that Church was carried out.It was curious to see him lying in the
parlor of this alien residence, candles at his head and feet, burning
sepulchrally, a silver cross upon his breast, caressed by his waxen
fingers.He would have smiled if he could have seen himself, but the
Kane family was too conventional, too set in its convictions, to find
anything strange in this.She was greatly distraught, for her
love, like Jennie's, was sincere.She left her room that night when
all was silent and leaned over the coffin, studying by the light of
the burning candles Lester's beloved features.Tears trickled down her
cheeks, for she had been happy with him.She caressed his cold cheeks
and hands.No
one told her that he had sent for Jennie.Meanwhile in the house on South Park Avenue sat a woman who was
enduring alone the pain, the anguish of an irreparable loss.Through
all these years the subtle hope had persisted, in spite of every
circumstance, that somehow life might bring him back to her.He had
come, it is true--he really had in death--but he had gone
again.Whither her mother, whither Gerhardt, whither Vesta had
gone?She could not hope to see him again, for the papers had informed
her of his removal to Mrs.Midgely's residence, and of the fact that
he was to be taken from Chicago to Cincinnati for burial.The last
ceremonies in Chicago were to be held in one of the wealthy Roman
Catholic churches of the South Side, St.Michael's, of which the
Midgelys were members.She would have liked so much to have
had him buried in Chicago, where she could go to the grave
occasionally, but this was not to be.She was never a master of her
fate.She thought of him as being taken
from her finally by the removal of the body to Cincinnati, as though
distance made any difference.She decided at last to veil herself
heavily and attend the funeral at the church.The paper had explained
that the services would be at two in the afternoon.Then at four the
body would be taken to the depot, and transferred to the train; the
members of the family would accompany it to Cincinnati.A little before the time for the funeral cortege to arrive at the
church there appeared at one of its subsidiary entrances a woman in
black, heavily veiled, who took a seat in an inconspicuous corner.She
was a little nervous at first, for, seeing that the church was dark
and empty, she feared lest she had mistaken the time and place; but
after ten minutes of painful suspense a bell in the church tower began
to toll solemnly.Shortly thereafter an acolyte in black gown and
white surplice appeared and lighted groups of candles on either side
of the altar.A hushed stirring of feet in the choir-loft indicated
that the service was to be accompanied by music.Some loiterers,
attracted by the bell, some idle strangers, a few acquaintances and
citizens not directly invited appeared and took seats.Never in her life had
she been inside a Catholic church.The gloom, the beauty of the
windows, the whiteness of the altar, the golden flames of the candles
impressed her.She was suffused with a sense of sorrow, loss, beauty,
and mystery.Life in all its vagueness and uncertainty seemed typified
by this scene.As the bell tolled there came from the sacristy a procession of
altar-boys.The smallest, an angelic youth of eleven, came first,
bearing aloft a magnificent silver cross.In the hands of each
subsequent pair of servitors was held a tall, lighted candle.The
priest, in black cloth and lace, attended by an acolyte on either
hand, followed.The procession passed out the entrance into the
vestibule of the church, and was not seen again until the choir began
a mournful, responsive chant, the Latin supplication for mercy and
peace.Then, at this sound the solemn procession made its reappearance.There came the silver cross, the candles, the dark-faced priest,
reading dramatically to himself as he walked, and the body of Lester
in a great black coffin, with silver handles, carried by the
pall-bearers, who kept an even pace.Jennie stiffened perceptibly, her
nerves responding as though to a shock from an electric current.She
did not know any of these men.Of the long company of notables who followed two by
two she recognized only three, whom Lester had pointed out to her in
times past.Kane she saw, of course, for she was directly behind
the coffin, leaning on the arm of a stranger; behind her walked Mr.He gave a quick glance to either side,
evidently expecting to see her somewhere; but not finding her, he
turned his eyes gravely forward and walked on.Jennie looked with all
her eyes, her heart gripped by pain.She seemed so much a part of this
solemn ritual, and yet infinitely removed from it all.The procession reached the altar rail, and the coffin was put down.A white shroud bearing the insignia of suffering, a black cross, was
put over it, and the great candles were set beside it.There were the
chanted invocations and responses, the sprinkling of the coffin with
holy water, the lighting and swinging of the censer and then the
mumbled responses of the auditors to the Lord's Prayer and to its
Catholic addition, the invocation to the Blessed Virgin.Jennie was
overawed and amazed, but no show of form colorful, impression
imperial, could take away the sting of death, the sense of infinite
loss.To Jennie the candles, the incense, the holy song were
beautiful.They touched the deep chord of melancholy in her, and made
it vibrate through the depths of her being.She was as a house filled
with mournful melody and the presence of death.Kane was sobbing convulsively
also.When it was all over the carriages were entered and the body was
borne to the station.All the guests and strangers departed, and
finally, when all was silent, she arose.Now she would go to the depot
also, for she was hopeful of seeing his body put on the train.They
would have to bring it out on the platform, just as they did in
Vesta's case.She took a car, and a little later she entered the
waiting-room of the depot.She lingered about, first in the concourse,
where the great iron fence separated the passengers from the tracks,
and then in the waiting-room, hoping to discover the order of
proceedings.She finally observed the group of immediate relatives
waiting--Mrs.Midgely, Louise, Amy, Imogene,
and the others.She actually succeeded in identifying most of them,
though it was not knowledge in this case, but pure instinct and
intuition.No one had noticed it in the stress of excitement, but it was
Thanksgiving Eve.Throughout the great railroad station there was a
hum of anticipation, that curious ebullition of fancy which springs
from the thought of pleasures to come.Announcers were
calling in stentorian voices the destination of each new train as the
time of its departure drew near.Jennie heard with a desperate ache
the description of a route which she and Lester had taken more than
once, slowly and melodiously emphasized."Detroit, Toledo, Cleveland,
Buffalo, and New York."There were cries of trains for "Fort Wayne,
Columbus, Pittsburg, Philadelphia, and points East," and then finally
for "Indianapolis, Louisville, Columbus, Cincinnati, and points
South."Several times Jennie had gone to the concourse between the
waiting-room and the tracks to see if through the iron grating which
separated her from her beloved she could get one last look at the
coffin, or the great wooden box which held it, before it was put on
the train.There was a baggage porter pushing a
truck into position near the place where the baggage car would stop.On it was Lester, that last shadow of his substance, incased in the
honors of wood, and cloth, and silver.There was no thought on the
part of the porter of the agony of loss which was represented here.He
could not see how wealth and position in this hour were typified to
her mind as a great fence, a wall, which divided her eternally from
her beloved.Was not her life a patchwork
of conditions made and affected by these things which she
saw--wealth and force--which had found her unfit?She had
evidently been born to yield, not seek.This panoply of power had been
paraded before her since childhood.What could she do now but stare
vaguely after it as it marched triumphantly by?She looked through the
grating, and once more there came the cry of "Indianapolis,
Louisville, Columbus, Cincinnati, and points South."A long red train,
brilliantly lighted, composed of baggage cars, day coaches, a
dining-car, set with white linen and silver, and a half dozen
comfortable Pullmans, rolled in and stopped.A great black engine,
puffing and glowing, had it all safely in tow.As the baggage car drew near the waiting truck a train-hand in
blue, looking out of the car, called to some one within.All she could see was the great box that was so soon to disappear.All she could feel was that this train would start presently, and then
it would all be over.There were Robert, and Amy, and Louise, and Midgely--all making
for the Pullman cars in the rear.They had said their farewells to
their friends.A trio of assistants "gave a
hand" at getting the great wooden case into the car.Jennie saw it
disappear with an acute physical wrench at her heart.There were many trunks to be put aboard, and then the door of the
baggage car half closed, but not before the warning bell of the engine
sounded.There was the insistent calling of "all aboard" from this
quarter and that; then slowly the great locomotive began to move.Its
bell was ringing, its steam hissing, its smoke-stack throwing aloft a
great black plume of smoke that fell back over the cars like a pall.The fireman, conscious of the heavy load behind, flung open a flaming
furnace door to throw in coal.Jennie stood rigid, staring into the wonder of this picture, her
face white, her eyes wide, her hands unconsciously clasped, but one
thought in her mind--they were taking his body away.A leaden
November sky was ahead, almost dark.She looked, and looked until the
last glimmer of the red lamp on the receding sleeper disappeared in
the maze of smoke and haze overhanging the tracks of the
far-stretching yard."Yes," said the voice of a passing stranger, gay with the
anticipation of coming pleasures."We're going to have a great time
down there.Uncle Jim is coming and Aunt Ella."Jennie did not hear that or anything else of the chatter and bustle
around her.Before her was stretching a vista of lonely years down
which she was steadily gazing.There
were those two orphan children to raise.They would marry and leave
after a while, and then what?Days and days in endless reiteration,
and then--?It is an excellent book with which to begin
the study of the ordinary forms of poetry, of plot structure, and the
simpler problems of description.For this reason in the exercises that
follow the emphasis has been placed on these topics._The Lady of the Lake_ is an excellent example of the minor epic.Corresponding to the "Arms and the man I sing," of the AEneid, and the
invocation to the Muse, are the statement of the theme, "Knighthood's
dauntless deed and Beauty's matchless eye," and the invocation to the
Harp of the North, in the opening stanzas.For the heroes, descendants
of the gods, of the great epic, we have a king, the chieftain of a
great clan, an outlaw earl and his daughter, characters less elevated
than those of the great epic, but still important.The element of the
supernatural brought in by the gods and goddesses of the epic is here
supplied by the minstrel, Brian the priest, and the harp.The interest
of the poem lies in the incidents as with the epic.The romantic story
of Ellen and Malcolm, however, lies quite outside the realm of the
great epic, which is concerned with the fate of a state or body of
people rather than with that of an individual.There are two threads to the story, one concerned with the love story
of Ellen and Malcolm, the main plot; and one with Roderick and his clan
against the King, the minor plot.The connection between them is very
slight, the story of Ellen could have been told almost without the
other, but the struggle of the Clan makes a fine background for the
love story of Ellen and Malcolm.The plot is an excellent one for the
beginner to study as the structure is so evident.The following is a
simple outline of the main incidents of the story.The coming of the stranger, later supposed by Roderick to
      be a spy of the King.The return of Douglas, guided by Malcolm, an act which
      brings Malcolm under the displeasure of the King.Roderick's proposal for Ellen's hand in order to avert the
      danger threatening Ellen and Douglas because of the recognition
      of the latter by the King's men.The rejection of the proposal, leading to the withdrawal of
      Ellen and her father to Coir-Uriskin and the departure of
      Douglas to the court to save Roderick and Malcolm.The preparations for war made by Roderick, including the
      sending of the Fiery Cross, and the Taghairm.Ellen and Allan-Bane at Coir-Uriskin.Douglas on his way to give himself up.The triumph of Fitz-James over Roderick.The interest reawakened in the King by Douglas's prowess
      and generosity.The battle of Beal 'an Duine.All of Scott's works afford excellent models of description for the
beginner in this very difficult form of composition.He deals with
the problems of description in a simple and evident manner.In most
cases he begins his description with the point of view, and chooses
the details in accordance with that point of view.The principle of
order used in the arrangement of the details is usually easy to find
and follow, and the beauty of his contrasts, the vanity and vividness
of his diction can be in a measure appreciated even by boys and girls
in the first year of the high school.If properly taught a pupil must
leave the study of the poem with a new sense of the power of words.In his description of character Scott deals with the most simple and
elemental emotions and is therefore fairly easy to imitate.In the
special topics under each canto special emphasis has been laid upon
description because of the adaptability of _his_ description to the needs
of the student.SPECIAL STUDIES IN THE CANTOS.CANTO I.

TEACHERS' OUTLINES FOR STUDIES IN ENGLISH

Based on the Requirements for Admission to College

By GILBERT SYKES BLAKELY, A.M., Instructor in English in the Morris
High School, New York City.This little book is intended to present to teachers plans for the study
of the English texts required for admission to college.These Outlines
are full of inspiration and suggestion, and will be welcomed by every
live teacher who hitherto, in order to avoid ruts, has been obliged to
compare notes with other teachers, visit classes, and note methods.The volume aims not at a discussion of the principles of teaching, but
at an application of certain principles to the teaching of some of the
books most generally read in schools.¶ The references by page and line to the book under discussion are to
the texts of the Gateway Series; but the Outlines can be used with any
series of English classics.¶ Certain brief plans of study are developed for the general teaching
of the novel, narrative poetry, lyric poetry, the drama, and the
essay.The suggestions are those of a practical teacher, and follow a
definite scheme in each work to be studied.There are discussions of
methods, topics for compositions, and questions for review.The lists
of questions are by no means exhaustive, but those that are given are
suggestive and typical.¶ The appendix contains twenty examinations in English, for admission
to college, recently set by different colleges in both the East and the
West.AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY

HALLECK'S NEW ENGLISH LITERATURE

By REUBEN POST HALLECK, M. A., LL.D. author of History of English
Literature, and History of American Literature.This New English Literature preserves the qualities which have caused
the author's former History of English Literature to be so widely used;
namely, suggestiveness, clearness, organic unity, interest, and power
to awaken thought and to stimulate the student to further reading.¶ Here are presented the new facts which have recently been brought
to light, and the new points of view which have been adopted.More
attention is paid to recent writers.The present critical point of
view concerning authors, which has been brought about by the new
social spirit, is reflected.Many new and important facts concerning
the Elizabethan theater and the drama of Shakespeare's time are
incorporated.¶ Other special features are the unusually detailed Suggested Readings
that follow each chapter, suggestions and references for a literary
trip to England, historical introductions to the chapters, careful
treatment of the modern drama, and a new and up-to-date bibliography.¶ Over 200 pictures selected for their pedagogical value and their
unusual character appear in their appropriate places in connection with
the text.The frontispiece, in colors, shows the performance of an
Elizabethan play in the Fortune Theater.AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY

A HISTORY OF AMERICAN LITERATURE

By REUBEN POST HALLECK, M.A., Principal, Male High School, Louisville,
Ky.A companion volume to the author's History of English Literature.It describes the greatest achievements in American literature from
colonial times to the present, placing emphasis not only upon men,
but also upon literary movements, the causes of which are thoroughly
investigated.Further, the relation of each period of American
literature to the corresponding epoch of English literature has been
carefully brought out--and each period is illuminated by a brief survey
of its history.¶ The seven chapters of the book treat in succession of Colonial
Literature, The Emergence of a Nation (1754-1809), the New York Group,
The New England Group, Southern Literature, Western Literature, and
the Eastern Realists.To these are added a supplementary list of less
important authors and their chief works, as well as A Glance Backward,
which emphasizes in brief compass the most important truths taught by
American literature.¶ At the end of each chapter is a summary which helps to fix the
period in mind by briefly reviewing the most significant achievements.This is followed by extensive historical and literary references for
further study, by a very helpful list of suggested readings, and by
questions and suggestions, designed to stimulate the student's interest
and enthusiasm, and to lead him to study and investigate further for
himself the remarkable literary record of American aspiration and
accomplishment.AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY

NONE SO DEAF AS THOSE WHO WON'T HEAR.SCENE.--_A parlor handsomely furnished, looking out on a garden;
    console in each corner; on one a lamp, a flower-vase on the other;
    door in flat, and doors right and left; window at right; gun
    standing in corner at left; table in front, left, with magazines,
    paper, pens, and ink; at right, front, an easy-chair, and small
    work-table, on which is a work-basket and hand-bell._

EGLANTINE (_sits at table, reading_).(_Throws
magazine down._) Ah, me!I can take no interest even in Trollope.(_Comes forward._) Did ever any girl suffer as I do?Nothing to do, nobody to see,--only father to talk to, and he deaf as
a post!(_Sits and looks at vase of flowers._) Well, I'll not stand
_this_.Enter JANE with a letter, in flat._) Jane, how
_can_ you be so neglectful?Throw them
away, and get me fresh at once.EGLANTINE (_jumps up_).Never any visitors; nothing but
letters now, and none of them for me.(_Sits._)

JANE.Yes, miss: your pa is a very sot man, and won't never see no
company, since he grew hard of hearing, three years ago.(_Takes the
flowers from vase._)

EGLANTINE.(_Sobs._)

JANE (_wiping lamp-glass_).And think of me, miss: took into
service for my voice, and obligated to holler at your pa all day long.Yes; yell and scream, I calls it.Has nothing been heard from that aurist papa wrote to a
month ago!I shall be a dummy in six
months, I'm sure.I hain't no more voice now than a frog.Don't laugh at the misfortunate, Miss Eglantine: 'tain't lucky.Forgive me, Jane: I didn't mean to.I believe I'm
hysterical; and no wonder,--shut up by myself like this, at nineteen.No wonder you finds it a bit dull, miss.I don't wonder at
it,--not a mite.And papa seems resolved to keep me unmarried.He says regular, "Not the son-in-law for
me."And it's got so bad that nobody now has
the courage to offer, a refusal is so certain.(_Sobs._) Or else I'm
sure that gentleman who danced the whole evening with me a month ago at
Lady Thornton's--

JANE.Yes, miss: I've heard you mention him often.He was dying to offer himself, I'm sure, from the way he
looked at me.(_Weeps._) O
Jane, how tedious, how tedious life is!(_Enter SINGLETON CODDLE, door R._)

CODDLE (_book in hand, from which he reads._) "Deafness is one of the
most distressing afflictions which can attack mankind."JANE (_shouts in his ear_).(_Holds it before
his eyes._)

CODDLE.(_Takes letter._) You
needn't stick letters into my eye, Jane: you only need tell me you have
them.(_Sits._)

EGLANTINE.If I could only manage to
peep over his shoulder!He can't never hear his
own voice, and don't know but he's reading to himself.He thinks out
loud too; and I knows every thing he has on his mind.It's quite a
blessing, really.(_Puts on glasses; catches sight of EGLANTINE._) Tut, tut,
Eglantine!Ten to one it's
confidential too!(_Crosses left, and reads aloud._) "My dear Coddle,
I flatter myself I have found a son-in-law to your taste at last,--a
nephew of mine, young, well educated, brilliant, and rich.Didn't I tell you so, miss?all very well, all very well, friend Pottle; but not the
man for _me_.There, miss, just what I told ye.I shall be in despair; I shall go crazy.For mercy's sake,
calm yourself.When life is the same dull round day after day!(_Exit R., furious._)

JANE (_carrying out the vase_).Her pa ain't got no
sense.--Ugh!(_Exit L._)

CODDLE.deafness is indeed a distressing affliction.A pause._) Still every cloud has its silver side.Without
my deafness I never could have survived the conversation--God
forgive me!--of my poor dear wife.It killed her; for, finding me
providentially beyond her reach, her loquacity struck in, and--there
she was.But now an inscrutable Providence has taken her from me,
(_Sighs deeply_) it would console me to hear a little.I wrote to a fellow who
advertises to cure deafness instantaneously by electro-acoustico
magnetism, and the impudent impostor hasn't taken the trouble to
answer.(_Takes
book again, and reads._) "In treating deafness, it should first be
ascertained whether the tympanum be thickened or perforated, and
whether also the minute bones of the auricular organ are yet intact."(_Sticks little finger in his ear._) I _think_ they're all right.(_Reads._) "And, further, be certain that the Eustachian tube is free
from obstruction."I wonder whether my Eustachian tube is obstructed.Enter JANE
L.; drops flower-pot._) Jane!It's quite a pleasure to smash things when
he's round.(_Throws pieces out of window._) Heads there!(_Rises._) I must go for her.(_Sees her at window;
shouts in her ear._) Jane!JANE (_puts hands to ears_).This is the fifteenth time I've called you.Yes, old wretch,--deaf when I want to be.(_Both
come down._)

CODDLE.I'd like to wring your bothersome neck.Look into my ear, Jane, and tell me
whether my Eustachian tube is obstructed.(_Shouts._) I can't see _nothing_.Jane, I hope you're not losing your voice.You don't speak half
so loudly as usual.Perhaps I'd better have it swabbed out, then.Luncheon's ready, do you say?Jane, I
like you, do you know, because you're such an intelligent creature.Yes: a very faithful, good, affectionate servant, Jane.I
haven't forgotten you in my will, Jane.You'll find I've got you
down there.I won't say how much, but something handsome, depend on
it,--something handsome.(_Sits down, and takes up book again._)

JANE.I've heard him say so
a score of times.He calls that handsome for busting my voice in his
service.(_Cries outside._)

VOICES.(_Gun fired under window._)

CODDLE.Yes, Jane, you'll be satisfied, I promise you.(_Another gun
heard._) Heaven will reward you for your care of me, my faithful girl.(_Looks up._) Why, where the devil has the woman gone to?CODDLE (_goes to window_).JANE (_shouts in his ear_).Man with a gun in your garden, smashing the
melon-frames, treading on the flower-beds!--Hey, you feller!(_Noise of breaking glass._)

CODDLE (_looks out_).The villain is smashing every thing I have in
the world!(_Seizes gun, JANE takes up a broom._) Follow me, Jane; follow
me.(_Both exeunt door in flat._)

    (_Enter WASHINGTON WHITWELL, left, gun in hand.Slams door behind
    him, advances on tiptoe, finger on trigger--glances around._)

WHITWELL.(_Sets gun down._) He certainly ran into this house!whose
house is it, by the way?Never saw a finer hare in my life.In all
my experience I never saw a finer hare!I couldn't have bought him
in the market under thirty cents.(_Rises._) He's cost me a pretty
penny, though.Dog starts a hare in ten
minutes.Off _I_ go, however,
hot foot after him.A dollar if you'll start out that hare."A dollar for a
hare worth thirty cents!This time gun goes off, dog don't.Hare gives me a
run of five miles.Wake up, and see hare not
ten yards away, munching a cabbage.He jumps
over a fence; _I_ jump over a fence.He comes down on his fore-paws;
_I_ come down on my fore-paws.He recovers his equilibrium; I recover
mine (on the flat of my back).Suddenly I observe myself to be hunted
by an army of rustics, my dollar friend among them,--well-meaning
people, no doubt,--armed with flails, forks, harrows, and ploughs, and
greedy for my life.And here I am, after smashing
fifty dollars' worth of glass and things!Total, including dog,
ninety-one dollars, not to mention fine for breaking melon-frames by
some miserable justice's court, say twenty dollars more!Grand total,
let me see: yes, a hundred and twenty dollars, more or less, for a
hare worth thirty-five cents!(_Picks up gun, rushes for door in flat--met
by CODDLE; runs to door at left--met by JANE._) Caught, by Jupiter!(_Falls into a chair._)

CODDLE.Surrender, young man, in the name of the Continental Congress.(_Collars him, and takes away his gun._)

WHITWELL.How dare you, sir, violate my privacy?fire your abominable gun under my window, sir?Oh, you
assassinating wretch!The police will have a few words to say to you before you're an
hour older, you burglar!This is a hanging matter, I'd
have you to know.WHITWELL (_stammering_).er--er--Whit--no--er--mat.JANE (_shouts in CODDLE'S ear_).Didn't you hear me call to you, you man-slaughterer?He don't say nothink, sir.(_Makes
signs of writing._)

CODDLE.I'll paper him, and ink him too!(_Sees paper on table._) Ah!(_Sits._)

JANE.He'll vanish in a flame of
fire, I warrant ye!WHITWELL (_gives paper to JANE_).JANE (_to CODDLE_).Grant, as you
say, of course.A Heaven-sent son-in-law!I must have a little confidential talk
with him, Jane.must I have a pair on 'em on
my hands!(_WHITWELL takes no
notice._) Delicious!Never again disbelieve in
special providences.(_Signs to WHITWELL to sit down._)

WHITWELL (_points to easy-chair_).(_Both sit._)

JANE.A pair of posts, like, and nary a trumpet
between 'em, except me.CODDLE (_looks at WHITWELL_).Young man, you look surprised at the
interest I take in you.(_Jumps up._) Jane, who knows but he's
already married!(_Sits, shouts._) Have you a wife?he's single, and marries Eglantine for sartain.(_Shouts._) Are you a bachelor?(_Projects his ear._)

WHITWELL.By Jove, _he's_ deaf, and no mistake.(_Roars._) Will you dine with us?I'll
take no refusal.--Jane, dinner at five.(_Courtesies._) Yah, old crosspatch!with your
providential son-in-laws, and your bachelors, and your dine-at-fives.No, thank you, Jane; not fish-balls.with your fish-balls and your curries.Oh, if it wasn't for
that trumpery legacy!(_Exit L., snarling._)

CODDLE.WHITWELL (_loudly_).My dear sir, is it possible you suffer such
insolence?Yes, a perfect treasure, my
young friend.Well, after that, deaf isn't the word for it.CODDLE (_rises, shuts doors and window, sets gun in corner, then sits
near WHITWELL.Shouts._) Now, my _dear_ friend, let us have a little
talk; a confidential talk, eh!Confidential, in a bellow like that!I asked you to dinner,
not that you might eat.What for, then, I'd like to know?Had you been a married man, I would have sent you
to jail with pleasure; but you're a bachelor.Now, I'm a father, with
a dear daughter as happy as the day is long.Possibly in every respect
you may not suit her.WHITWELL (_picks up hat_).Does the old dolt mean to insult me!But you suit _me_, my friend, to a T; and I offer
you her hand, plump, no more words about it.Sir; (_Aside._) She's humpbacked, I'll stake my life, a
dromedary!Between ourselves, sir,--in the strictest
confidence, mind,--she will bring you a nest-egg of fifty thousand
dollars.A double hump, then, beyond all doubt.Not a
dromedary,--a camel!(_Bows._) (_Shouts._) Sir, I
appreciate the honor, but I--(_Going._)

CODDLE.Not so fast; you can't go to her yet.If you could have heard a
word she said, you shouldn't have my daughter.Perhaps you may not have noticed that I'm a trifle
deaf.(_Shouts._) I think I
did notice it.A little hard of hearing, so to speak.You
see, young man, I live here entirely alone with my daughter.She talks
with nobody but _me_, and is as happy as a bird the livelong day.She must have a sweet old time of it.Now, suppose I were to take for a son-in-law one of the dozen
who have already teased my life out for her,--a fellow with his ears
entirely normal: of course they'd talk together in their natural
voice, and force me to be incessantly calling out, "What's that you're
saying?""I can't hear; say that again."The thing's preposterous, of course.Now, with
a son-in-law like yourself,--deaf as a door-post,--this annoyance
couldn't happen.You'd shout at your wife, she'd shout back, of course,
and I'd hear the whole conversation.(_Aside._) The old
scoundrel looks out for number one, don't he?(_Enter JANE, door in F., with visiting-card._)

CODDLE (_shouts_).I
get an audible son-in-law, you, a charming wife.she with a double hump on her
back, and he has the face to say she's charming.we're in for another deefy in the family.(_Shouts._) A
gentleman to see you, sir.(_Shouts._) Now, my
boy, before you see your future bride, you'll want to fix up a little,
eh?(_Points to door, R._) Step in there, my dear friend, and arrange
your dress.WHITWELL (_shakes his head_).(_Aside._) This scrape I'm in begins to look
alarming.(_Pushes him out._) Be
off, lad, be off.(_Motions to brush his
hair, &c._) Brushes, combs, collars, and a razor.(_Exit WHITWELL, R._)
I felt certain a merciful Providence would send me the right husband
for Eglantine at last.Dear, faithful, affectionate
Jane, wish me joy!1 E._)

            (_EGLANTINE enters R. as her father runs out._)

EGLANTINE.Jane, is any thing the matter with papa?He's found that son-in-law of
his'n,--that angel!In that there room, a-cleaning hisself.You've heared of the sacrifice of Abraham, Miss
Eglantine?Well, 'tain't a circumstance to the sacrifice of
Coddle!Maybe you know, miss, that, in the matter of hearing, your pa is
deficient?Alongside of the feller he's picked out for your beau,
your pa can hear the grass grow on the mounting-top, easy!Not deef, miss; deef ain't a touch to it.A hundred thousand times I refuse such a husband.Your pa can't marry
you without your consent: don't give it.(_Weeps._)

JANE.So it be, Miss Eglantine; so it be.Better give him the mitten out of hand, miss.I say!--He's
furrin, miss.--Mr.(_Knocks furiously._)

           (_WHITWELL comes out of chamber; sees EGLANTINE._)

WHITWELL (_aside_).Why, this is the gentleman I danced with at Sir
Edward's!Jane, this
gentleman hears as well as I do myself.How annoying I can't give a hint to Miss Coddle!If
that troublesome minx were only out of the way, now!Coddle, and I
des'say you does, but you don't suit _here_.Miss Eglantine, he can't hear nary a sound._You_ couldn't, if my finger and thumb were to meet
on your ear, you vixen!(_To EGLANTINE._) Miss Coddle is excessively
kind to receive me with such condescending politeness.I told you so, Miss Eglantine.He thinks I paid him a
compliment, sartain as yeast.When I met this poor gentleman at Lady
Thornton's, he was not afflicted in this way.Well, he's paying for all his sins now.It's
providential, I've no doubt.A dreadful misfortune has
befallen me since I had the pleasure of meeting you at the Thorntons'.My horse fell with me, and in falling I struck on my head.I have been
totally deaf ever since.Ordinary conversation I am incapable of hearing; but you,
Miss Coddle, whose loveliness has never been absent from my memory
since that happy day, you I am certain I could understand with ease.My
eyes will help me to interpret the movements of your lips.Speak to me,
and the poor sufferer whose sorrows awake your healing pity will surely
hear.(_Aside._) I hope old
Coddle won't never get that 'ere accomplishment.(_Exit slowly, I. U., much distressed._)

WHITWELL (_follows to door_).Stay, oh, stay, Miss Coddle!She's not for
you, jolterhead!WHITWELL (_shakes JANE violently_).I'm a jolterhead, am I?Lord forgive me, I do believe he can hear!(_Drops into chair._)

WHITWELL (_pulls her up_).For
your master, it suits me to be deaf.And, if you dare to betray me,
I'll let him know your treachery.I heard your impudent speeches, every
one of them.My hair
would turn snow in a single night!Silence for silence, then, you wretched woman.Besides, now you ain't deaf
no longer, I like you first-rate.If he
finds you out, all the fat'll be in the fire.To win Eglantine I'll be a horse-post, a
tomb-stone.Fire a thousand-pounder at my ear, and I'll not wink.Whittermat; and when I ring the
dinner-bell, don't you take no notice.But ain't I hungry, though, by Jove!JANE (_pushing him out C._).(_Exeunt L._)

                          (_Enter CODDLE, R._)

CODDLE.Wonderful electro-acoustico-
galvanism!(_Enter EGLANTINE._)

EGLANTINE (_screams_).CODDLE (_claps hands to his ears_).I have a surprise for you, sweet one.(_Sadly._)

CODDLE.Yes, cured miraculously by that wonderful aurist, with his
electro-magnetico--no, no; electro-galvanico--no, no; pshaw!CODDLE (_covering his ears_).My hearing is now abnormal;
actually abnormal, it is so acute.Perhaps _he_ can be cured, then.(_Shouts._)
Dearest papa, you cannot conceive how delighted I am.Whisper, Eglantine, for Heaven's sake!Forgive me, papa, it's habit.O papa, I've seen
him!(_Aside._) I really am
cured!Darling, you mustn't cry any more.No, papa, I won't, for I like him extremely now.He's so
handsome, and so amiable!Why, papa, you _asked_ him to marry me, Jane says.marry my darling to a
deaf man?O papa, you are cured: perhaps he can be cured in the same
way.Not another word, my love, about that horrible deaf fellow!I
asked him to dine here to-day, like an old ass; but I'll pack him off
immediately after.Papa, you will kill
me with your cruelty.(_Weeps._)

CODDLE.Pooh, darling, I've another, much better offer on hand.I got a letter this morning from my friend Pottle.His favorite
nephew--charming fellow.EGLANTINE (_sobbing_).Eglantine, a capital offer, I tell you.(_Stamps._)

CODDLE.But, Eglantine--

EGLANTINE.No, no, no, no, no!I'll kill
myself if I can't marry the man I love.(_Exit, weeping._)

CODDLE.(_Solus._) The image of her mother!And to think I've asked him to dinner!A scamp I don't know, and
never heard of, and who came into my house like a murderer, smashing
all my hot-houses!Confound him, I'll insult him till he can't see
out of his eyes!And I'll hand him
over to the police afterwards for malicious mischief--the horrid deaf
ruffian!The audacity of daring to demand my daughter's hand!Stop, stop, stop that
devilish tocsin!(_Looks down into garden._) There sits the miscreant,
reading a paper, and hearing nothing of a bell loud enough to wake the
dead.I long to witness the joy which irradiates her face, dear soul, when I
tell her I can hear.(_Calls._) Jane!--A
servant of an extinct species.(_Enter JANE with soup-tureen._) I've news for you, my faithful Jane.(_Looks round in bewilderment._)

JANE (_sets table, puts soup, &c., on it_).There's your soup, old
Coddle.Mollycoddle, I calls you!If it war'n't for that tuppenny legacy, old Cod, I'd do my best
to pop you into an asylum for idiots.(_Exit, C., meets WHITWELL._)

CODDLE.So this is her boasted fidelity, her undying
affection!Why, the faithless, abominable, ungrateful, treacherous
vixen!But her face is enough to show the vile blackness of her heart!And
the money I've bequeathed her.She sha'n't stay another twenty-four
hours in my house.(_Sees WHITWELL._) Nor you either, you swindling
vagabond.Hallo, the wind's shifted with a vengeance!(_Shouts._) Thank
you, you're very kind.(_Bows._) Very sorry I invited you,
you scamp!Hope you'll find my dinner uneatable.(_Shouts._) Very
true; a lovely prospect indeed.A man as deaf as this fellow (_bows, and points
to table_) should be hanged as a warning.(_Politely._) This is your
last visit here, I assure you.If it were only lawful to kick one's father-in-law, I'd do it
on the spot.(_Shouts._) Your unvarying kindness to a mere stranger,
sir, is an honor to human nature.(_Pulls away best chair, and goes
for another._) No, no: shot if he shall have the best chair in the
house!If he don't like it, he can lump it.CODDLE (_returns with a stool_).Here's the proper seat for you, you
pig!(_Shouts._) I offer you this with the greatest pleasure.(_Drops voice._) You intolerable
old brute!WHITWELL (_bowing politely_).If you're ever my father-in-law, I'll
show you how to treat a gentleman.I'll give Eglantine to a coal-heaver
first,--the animal!(_Shouts._) Pray be seated, (_drops voice_) and
choke yourself.One gets a very fine appetite after a hard day's
sport.(_Drops voice._) Atrocious old ruffian!(_They sit._)

WHITWELL (_shouts_).Will not Miss Coddle dine with us to-day?(_Shouts._) She's not well.This
soup is cold, I fear.(_Offers some._)

WHITWELL.(_Bows courteously a refusal._)

CODDLE.(_Shouts._) Nay, I insist.(_Drops voice._)
It's smoked,--just fit for you.(_Drops voice._) Old
savage, lucky for you I adore your lovely daughter!Shall I pitch this tureen at his head?--Jane!(_Enter JANE with
a dish._) Take off the soup, Jane.(_Puts dish on table._)

WHITWELL (_shouts_).(_Puts partridge on his own plate._) Jane can't
boil spinach.(_Helps WHITWELL to the spinach._)

WHITWELL (_rises_).(_Drops voice._) Get rid of you
all the sooner.--Jane, cigars.(_Crosses to R._)

WHITWELL (_aside, furious_).JANE (_aside to WHITWELL_).Don't
upset your fish-kittle.We'll have a little fun with the old
sheep.JANE (_takes box from console, and offers it; shouts_).I hope they'll turn your
stomick.CODDLE (_seizes her ear_).(_Pulls her round._) I'm a sheep, am I?I'm a
mollycoddle, am I?You'll have a little fun out of the old sheep, will you?You
tell me to shut up, eh?Clap me into an asylum, will you?(_Lets go her
ear._)

JANE.(_Crosses to L., screaming._)

                          (_Enter EGLANTINE._)

EGLANTINE.For heaven's sake, what _is_ the matter?WHITWELL (_stupefied_).Perfectly well, sir; and so it seems can you.I
will repeat, if you wish it, every one of those delectable compliments
you paid me five minutes since.WHITWELL (_to EGLANTINE_).Miss Coddle, has he
been shamming deafness, then, all this time?A doctor cured his deafness only half
an hour ago.Dear old master, was it kind to deceive me in this fashion?now ye can hear, I love you tenderer than
ever.Tell you, you pig, you minx!I tell you to walk out of my house.CODDLE (_loud to WHITWELL_).You are an impostor,
sir.EGLANTINE (_shrieks_).(_Hides her
face in her hands._)

WHITWELL.or I should have lost the rapture of
that sweet avowal.Coddle, I love--I adore your daughter.You heard
a moment since the confession that escaped her innocent lips.Surely
you cannot turn a deaf ear to the voice of nature, and see us both
miserable for life.Remember, sir, you have now no deaf ear to turn.Give you my daughter after all your frightful
insults?Remember how you treated me, sir; and reflect, too, that you
began it.Insults are not insults unless intended to be heard.For
every thing I said, I apologize from the bottom of my heart.CODDLE (_after a pause_)._Eglantine._ Papa, of course he does.Whittermat, I can't give my daughter to
a man I never heard of in my life,--and with such a preposterous name
too!My name is Whitwell, my dear sir,--not Whittermat: nephew of
your old friend Benjamin Pottle.What did you tell me your name was Whittermat for?Some singular mistake, sir: I never did.Can't imagine how
the mistake could have occurred.Well, since you heard
all _I_ said--Ha, ha, ha!For every Roland of mine you
gave me two Olivers at least.Diamond cut diamond,--ha, ha, ha!All laugh heartily._)

JANE.I never thought I'd live to see this happy day,
master.Hold your tongue, you impudent cat!Mollycoddle,
indeed!Coddle, you won't go for to turn off a faithful servant in
this way.(_Aside to WHITWELL._) That legacy's lost.(_To CODDLE._) Ah,
master dear!you won't find nobody else as'll work their fingers to the
bone, and their voice to a thread-paper, as I have: up early and down
late, and yelling and screeching from morning till night.Well, the
house will go to rack and ruin when I'm gone,--that's one comfort.WHITWELL (_aside to JANE_).The money's yours, cash down, the day of my
wedding.Well, well, Jane, I'll forgive you, for luck.But I wish you knew how to boil spinach.Harrold for a week
from to-day, and invite all our friends (_to the audience_) to witness
the wedding.All who mean to come will please signify it by clapping their hands,
and the harder the better.(_Curtain falls._)

BAKER, Hamilton Place, Boston, Mass.Transcriber's Note:

    Every effort has been made to replicate this text as faithfully as
    possible.Italic text has been marked with _underscores_."You'll take me away, won't
you, Dan?"So that's your game, my young chicken, is it?"demanded Donovan,
seizing our hero roughly by the shoulder.Then pulling off Dan's hat, he
added: "You're no more Italian than I am."Dan saw that it would be useless to keep up the deceit any longer.He
looked Donovan full in the face, and said, firmly:

"You are right, Mr.Donovan, I have come here for my sister."Donovan's red face turned fairly purple with rage.Why, I could crush you with my little
finger.""I have not insulted you," said Dan."I don't know anything about your sister."That little girl is my adopted sister," said Dan, pointing to Althea."Ask her if she doesn't know me.""That is my daughter, Katy Donovan," said the saloon keeper."No, I am not," said Althea, beginning to cry."I want to go away with
my brother Dan."Donovan," (by
this time she was on her feet, looking on in a dazed sort of way), "is
not this our little Katy?""You see, young man, you're mistaken.You can leave," and Donovan waved
his hand triumphantly.I can bring plenty of proof that Althea was until a week since
living with my mother."said Donovan, contemptuously snapping his
fingers."I know who stole her, and who brought her to this house," continued
Dan."The same man has been here to-day," added Dan.How much does he pay you for taking
care of the girl?""I can't waste my time
talkin' wid you."No, I won't, unless Althea goes with me," said Dan, firmly.We'll see about that," and Donovan, making a rush,
seized Dan in his arms, and carried him down stairs, despite our hero's
resistance."I'll tache you to come here insultin' your betters!"Dan struggled to get away, but though a strong boy, he was not a match
for a powerful man, and could not effect his deliverance.The Irishman
already referred to was still upon the settee.he asked, as the saloon-keeper appeared with his
burden."What's the lad been doin'?""What's he been doin', is it?He's been insultin' me to my face--that's
what the Donovans won't stand."Don't trouble me wid your questions, but do as I tell you.Not quite willingly, but reluctant to offend Donovan, who gave him
credit for the drinks, Barney raised a trap-door leading to the cellar
below.There was a ladder for the convenience of those wishing to ascend and
descend, but Donovan was not disposed to use much ceremony with the boy
who had offended him.He dropped him through the opening, Dan by good
luck falling on his feet."That's the best place for you, you young meddler!""You'll
find it mighty comfortable, and I wish you much joy.I won't charge you
no rint, and that's an object in these hard times--eh, Barney?""To be sure it is," said Barney; "but all the same, Donovan, I'd rather
pay rint up stairs, if I had my choice!""He hasn't the choice," said Donovan triumphantly."What's it all about now, Donovan?""He wanted to shtale my Katy," said Donovan.asked Donovan, not caring to go
into particulars.Barney indicated his choice with alacrity, and, after drinking, was
hardly in a condition to pursue his inquiries.DAN DISCOMFITS THE DONOVANS.Dan found himself at first bewildered and confused by his sudden descent
into the cellar.As his eyes became accustomed to the darkness, he was
able to get an idea of his surroundings.It was a common cellar with an
earthen floor.Ranged along one side was a row of kegs, some containing
whisky, others empty.Besides, there were a few boxes and odds and ends
which had been placed here to get them out of the way."Not a very cheerful-looking place," thought Dan, "though I do get it
rent free."He sat down on a box, and began to consider his position.The walls were solid, and although there was a narrow
window, consisting of a row of single panes, it was at the top of the
cellar, and not easily accessible.He might indeed reach it by the
ladder, but he would have to break the glass and crawl through, a mode
of escape likely to be attended by personal risk."No, that won't do," thought Dan."At any rate, I won't try it till
other things fail."Meanwhile Donovan, in the bar-room above, was in high good humor.He
felt that he had done a sharp thing, and more than once chuckled as he
thought of his prisoner below.Indeed he could not forbear, after about
half an hour, lifting the trap and calling down stairs:

"Hallo, there!""You're an impudent jackanapes!""You'll
get enough of it before you're through.""So will you," answered Dan, boldly."I'll take the risk," chuckled Donovan."Do you know what you remind me
of?""You're like a rat in a trap.""Not exactly," answered Dan, as a bright thought dawned upon him."Because a rat can do no harm, and I can."It occurred to Donovan that Dan might have some matches in his pocket,
and was momentarily alarmed at the thought that our hero might set the
house on fire."If you had," said the saloon-keeper, relieved, "it would do you no good
to set a fire."I don't mean to set the house on fire," said Dan, composedly.returned Dan, rising from his seat on the box.asked Donovan, following with his glance the
boy's motion."I'm going to take the spigot out of them
whisky-kegs, and let the whisky run out on the floor."exclaimed the saloon-keeper, now thoroughly
frightened.As he spoke Dan dextrously pulled the spigot from a keg, and Donovan, to
his dismay, heard the precious liquid--precious in his eyes--pouring out
upon the floor.With an exertion he raised the trap-door, hastily descended the ladder,
and rushed to the keg to replace the spigot.Meanwhile Dan ran up the ladder, pulled it after him, and made his late
jailer a captive."Put down the ladder, you young rascal!"roared Donovan, when, turning
from his work, he saw how the tables had been turned."It wouldn't be convenient just yet," answered Dan, coolly.He shut the trap-door, hastily lugged the ladder to the rear of the
house (unobserved, for there were no customers present), then dashed up
stairs and beckoned to Althea to follow him.Donovan was stupefied by liquor.Putting on her things, the little girl hastily and gladly obeyed.As they passed through the saloon, Donovan's execrations and shouts were
heard proceeding from the cellar."Never you mind, Althea," said Dan.The two children hurried to the nearest horse-car, which luckily came up
at the moment, and jumped on board.Dan looked back with a smile at the saloon, saying to himself:

"I rather think, Mr.Donovan, you've found your match this time.I hope
you'll enjoy the cellar as much as I did."In about an hour and a half Dan, holding Althea by the hand,
triumphantly led her into his mother's presence."I've brought her back, mother," he said."Oh, my dear, dear little girl!""I
thought I should never, never see you again.But we will not wait to hear a twice-told tale.Rather let us return to
Donovan, where the unhappy proprietor is still a captive in his own
cellar.Here he remained till his cries attracted the attention of a
wondering customer, who finally lifted the trap-door."What are you doin' down there?""Put down the ladder and let me up first of all."It was a considerable time before the ladder was found.Then the
saloon-keeper emerged from his prison in a very bad humor."I wish I had left you there," said the customer, with justifiable
indignation."This is your gratitude for my trouble, is it?""Excuse me, but I'm so mad with that cursed boy."Come, that's talking," said the placated customer."Wait a minute," said Donovan, a sudden fear possessing him.He rushed up stairs and looked for Althea.His wife was lying on the floor, breathing heavily, but the little girl
was gone.exclaimed Donovan,
sinking into a chair.Then, in a blind fury with the wife who didn't prevent the little girl's
recapture, he seized a pail of water and emptied it over the face of the
prostrate woman.Donovan came to, and berated her husband furiously."Serves you right, you jade!"It was certainly an unlucky day for the Donovans.After calling at Donovan's, on the day when Dan recovered Althea, John
Hartley crossed the Courtlandt street ferry, and took a train to
Philadelphia with Blake, his accomplice in the forged certificates.The
two confederates had raised some Pennsylvania railway certificates,
which they proposed to put on the Philadelphia market.They spent several days in the Quaker City, and thus Hartley heard
nothing of the child's escape.Donovan did not see fit to inform him, as this would stop the weekly
remittance for the child's board, and, moreover, draw Hartley's
indignation down upon his head.One day, in a copy of the _New York Herald_, which he purchased at the
news-stand in the Continental Hotel, Hartley observed the arrival of
Harriet Vernon at the Fifth Avenue Hotel."I thought she would come," he said to himself, with a smile."I have
her in my power at last.She must submit to my terms, or lose sight of
the child altogether.""Blake," he said, aloud, "I must take the first train to New York.""On the contrary, I see a chance of making a good haul."Vernon sat in her room at the Fifth
Avenue Hotel.A servant brought up a card bearing the name of John
Hartley."He is prompt," she said to herself, with a smile."Probably he has not
heard of Althea's escape from the den to which he carried her.I will
humor him, in that case, and draw him out.""I will see the gentleman in the parlor," she said.Five minutes later she entered the ladies' parlor.Hartley rose to
receive her with a smile of conscious power, which told Harriet Vernon
that he was ignorant of the miscarriage of his plans."I heard of your _unexpected_ arrival, Mrs.Vernon," he commenced, "and
have called to pay my respects.""Your motive is appreciated, John Hartley," she said, coldly."That's pleasant," he said, mockingly."May I beg to apologize for
constraining you to cross the Atlantic?""Don't apologize; you have merely acted out your nature.""Probably that is not meant to be complimentary.However, it can't be
helped.""I suppose you have something to say to me, John Hartley," said Mrs.I wrote you that I had ferreted out your cunningly
devised place of concealment for my daughter."She seemed very cool and composed,
whereas he expected she would be angry and disturbed."We may as well come to business at once," he said."If you wish to
recover the charge of your ward, you must accede to my terms.""They are expressed in my letter to you.You must agree to pay me a
thousand dollars each quarter.""It strikes me you are exorbitant in your demands."At any rate, the money won't come out of you.It will
come from my daughter's income.""So you would rob your daughter, John Hartley?"Is
she to live in luxury, and with thousands to spare, while I, her only
living parent, wander penniless and homeless about the world.""I might sympathize with you, if I did not know how you have misused the
gifts of fortune, and embittered the existence of my poor sister.As it
is, it only disgusts me.""I don't want you sympathy, Harriet Vernon," he said, roughly."I want
four thousand dollars a year.""Suppose I decline to let you have it?""Then you must take the consequences," he said, quickly."That you and Althea will be forever separated.He looked at her intently to see the effect of his threat.Harriet Vernon was as cool and imperturbable as ever."Have you been in New York for a week past?"she asked, as he thought,
irrelevantly."Because you don't appear to know what has happened."As for me, I bid you good-evening.""I mean, John Hartley, that you are not as shrewd as you imagine.I mean
that a boy has foiled you; and while you were doubtless laughing at his
simplicity, he has proved more than a match for you.You have no claim
upon me, and I must decline your disinterested proposal."She left the room, leaving him crest-fallen and stupefied.He started for Brooklyn immediately, and toward eleven o'clock entered
the saloon at Donovan's."She's gone," he cried, "but I couldn't help it, Mr.On my
honor, I couldn't."The story was told, Donovan ending by invoking curses upon the boy who
had played such a trick upon him."I am ashamed of you, for
allowing a boy to get the best of you.""That boy's a fox," said Donovan."He's a match for the old one, he is.I'd like to break his neck for him."I may get hold of the girl again," mused Hartley, as
he rose to go."If I do, I won't put her in charge of such a
dunderhead."He left Donovan's and returned to New York, but he had hardly left the
Fulton ferry-boat when he was tapped on the shoulder by an officer."A little financial irregularity, as they call it in Wall street.You
may know something about some raised railroad certificates!"The morning papers contained an account of John Hartley's arrest, and
the crime with which he was charged.Harriet Vernon read it at the breakfast-table with an interest which may
be imagined."I don't like to rejoice in any man's misfortune," she said to herself,
"but now I can have a few years of peace.My precious brother-in-law
will doubtless pass the next few years in enforced seclusion, and I can
have a settled home."Directly after breakfast, she set out for the humble home of her niece.She found all at home, for Dan was not to go back to business till
Monday."Well, my good friend," she said, "I have news for you.""Good news, I hope," said Dan.Henceforth I can have Althea with me.The obstacle that
separated us is removed."Mordaunt's countenance fell, and Dan looked sober.It was plain
that Althea was to be taken from them, and they had learned to love her."I am very glad," faltered Mrs."You don't look glad," returned Mrs."You see we don't like to part with Althea," explained Dan, who
understood his mother's feelings."Who said you were to part with the child?""I thought you meant to take her from us."Your mistake is a natural one, for I have not told you my
plans.I mean to take a house up town, install Mrs.Mordaunt as my
housekeeper and friend, and adopt this young man (indicating Dan),
provided he has no objection."I have plenty of money, and no one to care for, or to
care for me.I have taken a fancy to you all, and I am quite sure that
we can all live happily together.Althea is my niece, and you, Dan, may
call me aunt, too, if you like.Dan offered her his hand in a frank, cordial way, which she liked."So it is settled, then," she said, in a pleased voice."I ought to warn
you," she added, "that I have the reputation of being ill-tempered.You
may get tired of living with me.""We'll take the risk," said Dan, smiling.Vernon, whose habit it was to act promptly, engaged a house on
Madison avenue, furnished it without regard to expense, and in less than
a fortnight, installed her friends in it.Then she had a talk with Dan
about his plans."Do you wish to remain in your place," she asked, "or would you like to
obtain a better education first?""To obtain an education," said Dan, promptly."Then give notice to your employer of your intention."Vernon in a second interview informed him that besides defraying
his school expenses, she should give him an allowance of fifty dollars a
month for his own personal needs."May I give a part of it to my mother?""You don't ask why I refuse," she said."I suppose you have a good reason," said Dan, dubiously."My reason is that I shall pay your mother double this sum.Unless she
is very extravagant it ought to be enough to defray her expenses."exclaimed Dan, in fresh
astonishment.All these important changes in the position of the Mordaunts were
unknown to their old friends, who, since their loss of property, had
given them the cold shoulder.One day Tom Carver, in passing the house, saw Dan coming down the steps
quite as handsomely dressed as himself."I didn't know what else could carry you to such a house.""Oh, that's easily explained," said Dan."You don't mean to say she boards there?"asked Tom, in a more deferential tone.At any rate she gives me a handsome allowance.""And you don't have anything to do?""Why, my father only
allows me three dollars a week."I don't need as much as my aunt allows me.""I say, Dan," said Tom, in the most friendly terms, "I'm awfully hard
up."Yes," said Dan, secretly amused with the change in Tom's manner.said Tom, linking his arm in Dan's."I'm very glad you're rich again."Thank you," said Dan, smiling, "but I'm afraid you have forgotten
something.""You know I used to be a newsboy in front of the Astor House.""And you might not care to associate with a newsboy.""Well, you are all right now," said Tom, magnanimously."You didn't always think so, Tom.""I always thought you were a gentleman, Dan."I suppose it's the way of the world," thought Dan."It is lucky that
there are some true friends who stick by us through thick and thin."Mordaunt had an experience similar to Dan's.Her old acquaintances,
who, during her poverty never seemed to recognize her when they met,
gradually awoke to the consciousness of her continued existence, and
left cards.She received them politely, but rated their professions of
friendship at their true value.They had not been "friends in need," and
she could not count them "friends indeed."Six years rolled by, bringing with them many changes.The little family
on Madison avenue kept together.She had a hearty love for young people, and enjoyed the growth and
development of her niece Althea, and Dan, whom she called her nephew and
loved no less.He completed his preparation for college, and
graduated with high honors.He is no less frank, handsome, and
self-reliant than when as a boy he sold papers in front of the Astor
House for his mother's support.He looks forward to a business life, and
has accepted an invitation to go abroad to buy goods in London and Paris
for his old firm.He was, in fact, preparing to go when a mysterious
letter was put in his hands.It ran thus:


     "MR.DANIEL MORDAUNT:--I shall take it as a great favor if you will
     come to the St.Nicholas Hotel this evening, and inquire for me.I
     am sick, or I would not trouble you.I have to speak
     to you on a matter of great importance."I don't know of any one of that name."I cannot think of any one," said Mrs."I hope you won't go,
Dan," she added, anxiously; "it may be a trap laid by a wicked and
designing man.""You forget that I am not a boy any longer, mother," said Dan, smiling."I think I can defend myself, even if Mr.Davis is a wicked and
designing person."To her he was
still a boy, though in the eyes of others an athletic young man.Davis at the hotel, Dan was ushered into a room on
the third floor.Seated in an arm-chair was an elderly man, weak and
wasted, apparently in the last stages of consumption."It would have been well if he had not known me, for I did him a great
wrong."said Dan, trying to connect the name with his
father.You see before you Robert Hunting, once your
father's book-keeper."Dan's handsome face darkened, and he said, bitterly:

"You killed my father!""Heaven help me, I fear I did!"sighed Davis--to call him by his later
name."The money of which you robbed him caused him to fail, and failure led
to his death.""I have accused myself of this crime oftentimes," moaned Davis."Don't
think that the money brought happiness, for it did not."From Europe I went to
Brazil, and engaged in business in Rio Janeiro.A year since I found my
health failing, and have come back to New York to die.But before I die
I want to make what reparation I can.""You cannot call my father back to me," said Dan, sadly."No; but I can restore the money that I stole.That is the right
word--stole.I hope you and your mother have not suffered?""We saw some hard times, but for years we have lived in comfort."Will you bring a lawyer to me to-morrow evening?"You might keep every dollar if you would bring my father back."The next evening Davis transferred to Dan and his mother property
amounting to fifty thousand dollars, in payment of what he had taken,
with interest, and in less than a month later he died, Dan taking upon
himself the charge of the funeral.His trip to Europe was deferred, and
having now capital to contribute, he was taken as junior partner into
the firm where he had once filled the position of office-boy.His father had failed disastrously, and
Tom is glad to accept a minor clerkship from the boy at whom he once
sneered.Julia Rogers has never lost her preference for Dan.It is whispered that
they are engaged, or likely soon to be, and Dan's assiduous attentions
to the young lady make the report a plausible one.John Hartley was sentenced to a term of years in prison.Harriet Vernon
dreaded the day of his release, being well convinced that he would seize
the earliest opportunity to renew his persecutions.She had about made
up her mind to buy him off, when she received intelligence that he was
carried off by fever, barely a month before the end of his term.It was
a sad end of a bad life, but she could not regret him.Althea was saved
the knowledge of her father's worthlessness.She was led to believe that
he had died when she was a little girl.Dan, the young detective, has entered
upon a career of influence and prosperity.The hardships of his earlier
years contributed to strengthen his character, and give him that
self-reliance of which the sons of rich men so often stand in need.A
similar experience might have benefited Tom Carver, whose lofty
anticipations have been succeeded by a very humble reality.Let those
boys who are now passing through the discipline of poverty and
privation, take courage and emulate the example of "Dan, the Detective."A. L. BURT'S PUBLICATIONS

For Young People

BY POPULAR WRITERS,

97-99-101 Reade Street, New York.+Bonnie Prince Charlie+: A Tale of Fontenoy and Culloden.By G. A.
     HENTY.With 12 full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.The adventures of the son of a Scotch officer in French service.The
boy, brought up by a Glasgow bailie, is arrested for aiding a Jacobite
agent, escapes, is wrecked on the French coast, reaches Paris, and
serves with the French army at Dettingen.He kills his father's foe in a
duel, and escaping to the coast, shares the adventures of Prince
Charlie, but finally settles happily in Scotland."Ronald, the hero, is very like the hero of 'Quentin Durward.'The
     lad's journey across France, and his hairbreadth escapes, make up
     as good a narrative of the kind as we have ever read.For freshness
     of treatment and variety of incident Mr.Henty has surpassed
     himself."--_Spectator._


     +With Clive in India+; or, the Beginnings of an Empire.By G. A.
     HENTY.With 12 full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.The period between the landing of Clive as a young writer in India and
the close of his career was critical and eventful in the extreme.At its
commencement the English were traders existing on sufferance of the
native princes.At its close they were masters of Bengal and of the
greater part of Southern India.The author has given a full and accurate
account of the events of that stirring time, and battles and sieges
follow each other in rapid succession, while he combines with his
narrative a tale of daring and adventure, which gives a lifelike
interest to the volume."He has taken a period of Indian history of the most vital
     importance, and he has embroidered on the historical facts a story
     which of itself is deeply interesting.Young people assuredly will
     be delighted with the volume."--_Scotsman._


     +The Lion of the North+: A Tale of Gustavus Adolphus and the Wars of
     Religion.With full-page Illustrations by JOHN
     SCHÖNBERG.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Henty gives the history of the first part of the
Thirty Years' War.The issue had its importance, which has extended to
the present day, as it established religious freedom in Germany.The
army of the chivalrous king of Sweden was largely composed of Scotchmen,
and among these was the hero of the story."The tale is a clever and instructive piece of history, and as boys
     may be trusted to read it conscientiously, they can hardly fail to
     be profited."--_Times._


     +The Dragon and the Raven+; or, The Days of King Alfred.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND, R.I.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.In this story the author gives an account of the fierce struggle between
Saxon and Dane for supremacy in England, and presents a vivid picture of
the misery and ruin to which the country was reduced by the ravages of
the sea-wolves.The hero, a young Saxon thane, takes part in all the
battles fought by King Alfred.He is driven from his home, takes to the
sea and resists the Danes on their own element, and being pursued by
them up the Seine, is present at the long and desperate siege of Paris."Treated in a manner most attractive to the boyish
     reader."--_Athenæum._


     +The Young Carthaginian+: A Story of the Times of Hannibal.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND, R.I.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.Boys reading the history of the Punic Wars have seldom a keen
appreciation of the merits of the contest.That it was at first a
struggle for empire, and afterward for existence on the part of
Carthage, that Hannibal was a great and skillful general, that he
defeated the Romans at Trebia, Lake Trasimenus, and Cannæ, and all but
took Rome, represents pretty nearly the sum total of their knowledge.To
let them know more about this momentous struggle for the empire of the
world Mr.Henty has written this story, which not only gives in graphic
style a brilliant description of a most interesting period of history,
but is a tale of exciting adventure sure to secure the interest of the
reader.From first to last nothing
     stays the interest of the narrative.It bears us along as on a
     stream whose current varies in direction, but never loses its
     force."--_Saturday Review._


     +In Freedom's Cause+: A Story of Wallace and Bruce.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.In this story the author relates the stirring tale of the Scottish War
of Independence.The extraordinary valor and personal prowess of Wallace
and Bruce rival the deeds of the mythical heroes of chivalry, and indeed
at one time Wallace was ranked with these legendary personages.The
researches of modern historians have shown, however, that he was a
living, breathing man--and a valiant champion.The hero of the tale
fought under both Wallace and Bruce, and while the strictest historical
accuracy has been maintained with respect to public events, the work is
full of "hairbreadth'scapes" and wild adventure."It is written in the author's best style.Full of the wildest and
     most remarkable achievements, it is a tale of great interest, which
     a boy, once he has begun it, will not willingly put on one
     side."--_The Schoolmaster._


     +With Lee in Virginia+: A Story of the American Civil War.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.The story of a young Virginian planter, who, after bravely proving his
sympathy with the slaves of brutal masters, serves with no less courage
and enthusiasm under Lee and Jackson through the most exciting events of
the struggle.He has many hairbreadth escapes, is several times wounded
and twice taken prisoner; but his courage and readiness and, in two
cases, the devotion of a black servant and of a runaway slave whom he
had assisted, bring him safely through all difficulties."One of the best stories for lads which Mr.The picture is full of life and color, and the stirring and
     romantic incidents are skillfully blended with the personal
     interest and charm of the story."--_Standard._


     +By England's Aid+; or, The Freeing of the Netherlands (1585-1604).With full-page Illustrations by ALFRED PEARSE, and
     Maps.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.The story of two English lads who go to Holland as pages in the service
of one of "the fighting Veres."After many adventures by sea and land,
one of the lads finds himself on board a Spanish ship at the time of the
defeat of the Armada, and escapes only to fall into the hands of the
Corsairs.He is successful in getting back to Spain under the protection
of a wealthy merchant, and regains his native country after the capture
of Cadiz.It overflows with stirring
     incident and exciting adventure, and the color of the era and of
     the scene are finely reproduced.The illustrations add to its
     attractiveness."--_Boston Gazette._


     +By Right of Conquest+; or, With Cortez in Mexico.With full-page Illustrations by W. S. STACEY, and Two Maps.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.50.The conquest of Mexico by a small band of resolute men under the
magnificent leadership of Cortez is always rightly ranked among the most
romantic and daring exploits in history.With this as the groundwork of
his story Mr.Henty has interwoven the adventures of an English youth,
Roger Hawkshaw, the sole survivor of the good ship Swan, which had
sailed from a Devon port to challenge the mercantile supremacy of the
Spaniards in the New World.He is beset by many perils among the
natives, but is saved by his own judgment and strength, and by the
devotion of an Aztec princess.At last by a ruse he obtains the
protection of the Spaniards, and after the fall of Mexico he succeeds in
regaining his native shore, with a fortune and a charming Aztec bride."'By Right of Conquest' is the nearest approach to a perfectly
     successful historical tale that Mr.Henty has yet
     published."--_Academy._


     +In the Reign of Terror+: The Adventures of a Westminster Boy.By G.
     A. HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by J. SCHÖNBERG.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.Harry Sandwith, a Westminster boy, becomes a resident at the chateau of
a French marquis, and after various adventures accompanies the family to
Paris at the crisis of the Revolution.Imprisonment and death reduce
their number, and the hero finds himself beset by perils with the three
young daughters of the house in his charge.After hairbreadth escapes
they reach Nantes.There the girls are condemned to death in the
coffin-ships, but are saved by the unfailing courage of their boy
protector."Harry Sandwith, the Westminster boy, may fairly be said to beat
     Mr.His adventures will delight boys by the
     audacity and peril they depict.... The story is one of Mr.Henty's
     best."--_Saturday Review._


     +With Wolfe in Canada+; or, The Winning of a Continent.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.Henty gives an account of the struggle between
Britain and France for supremacy in the North American continent.On the
issue of this war depended not only the destinies of North America, but
to a large extent those of the mother countries themselves.The fall of
Quebec decided that the Anglo-Saxon race should predominate in the New
World; that Britain, and not France, should take the lead among the
nations of Europe; and that English and American commerce, the English
language, and English literature, should spread right round the globe."It is not only a lesson in history as instructively as it is
     graphically told, but also a deeply interesting and often thrilling
     tale of adventure and peril by flood and field."--_Illustrated
     London News._


     +True to the Old Flag+: A Tale of the American War of Independence.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.In this story the author has gone to the accounts of officers who took
part in the conflict, and lads will find that in no war in which
American and British soldiers have been engaged did they behave with
greater courage and good conduct.The historical portion of the book
being accompanied with numerous thrilling adventures with the redskins
on the shores of Lake Huron, a story of exciting interest is interwoven
with the general narrative and carried through the book."Does justice to the pluck and determination of the British
     soldiers during the unfortunate struggle against American
     emancipation.The son of an American loyalist, who remains true to
     our flag, falls among the hostile redskins in that very Huron
     country which has been endeared to us by the exploits of Hawkeye
     and Chingachgook."--_The Times._


     +The Lion of St.Mark+: A Tale of Venice in the Fourteenth Century.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.A story of Venice at a period when her strength and splendor were put to
the severest tests.The hero displays a fine sense and manliness which
carry him safely through an atmosphere of intrigue, crime, and
bloodshed.He contributes largely to the victories of the Venetians at
Porto d'Anzo and Chioggia, and finally wins the hand of the daughter of
one of the chief men of Venice."Every boy should read 'The Lion of St.Henty has never
     produced a story more delightful, more wholesome, or more
     vivacious."--_Saturday Review._


     +A Final Reckoning+: A Tale of Bush Life in Australia.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by W. B. WOLLEN.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.The hero, a young English lad, after rather a stormy boyhood, emigrates
to Australia, and gets employment as an officer in the mounted police.A
few years of active work on the frontier, where he has many a brush with
both natives and bushrangers, gain him promotion to a captaincy, and he
eventually settles down to the peaceful life of a squatter.Henty has never published a more readable, a more carefully
     constructed, or a better written story than this."--_Spectator._


     +Under Drake's Flag+: A Tale of the Spanish Main.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.A story of the days when England and Spain struggled for the supremacy
of the sea.The heroes sail as lads with Drake in the Pacific
expedition, and in his great voyage of circumnavigation.The historical
portion of the story is absolutely to be relied upon, but this will
perhaps be less attractive than the great variety of exciting adventure
through which the young heroes pass in the course of their voyages."A book of adventure, where the hero meets with experience enough,
     one would think, to turn his hair gray."--_Harper's Monthly
     Magazine._


     +By Sheer Pluck+: A Tale of the Ashanti War.With
     full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.The author has woven, in a tale of thrilling interest, all the details
of the Ashanti campaign, of which he was himself a witness.His hero,
after many exciting adventures in the interior, is detained a prisoner
by the king just before the outbreak of the war, but escapes, and
accompanies the English expedition on their march to Coomassie.Henty keeps up his reputation as a writer of boys' stories.'By Sheer Pluck' will be eagerly read."--_Athenæum._


     +By Pike and <DW18>+: A Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic.By G.
     A. HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by MAYNARD BROWN, and 4
     Maps.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Henty traces the adventures and brave deeds of an
English boy in the household of the ablest man of his age--William the
Silent.Edward Martin, the son of an English sea-captain, enters the
service of the Prince as a volunteer, and is employed by him in many
dangerous and responsible missions, in the discharge of which he passes
through the great sieges of the time.He ultimately settles down as Sir
Edward Martin."Boys with a turn for historical research will be enchanted with
     the book, while the rest who only care for adventure will be
     students in spite of themselves."--_St.James' Gazette._


     +St.George for England+: A Tale of Cressy and Poitiers.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.No portion of English history is more crowded with great events than
that of the reign of Edward III.Cressy and Poitiers; the destruction of
the Spanish fleet; the plague of the Black Death; the Jacquerie rising;
these are treated by the author in "St.The hero of
the story, although of good family, begins life as a London apprentice,
but after countless adventures and perils becomes by valor and good
conduct the squire, and at last the trusted friend of the Black Prince.Henty has developed for himself a type of historical novel for
     boys which bids fair to supplement, on their behalf, the historical
     labors of Sir Walter Scott in the land of fiction."--_The
     Standard._


     +Captain Kidd's Gold+: The True Story of an Adventurous Sailor Boy.By JAMES FRANKLIN FITTS.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.There is something fascinating to the average youth in the very idea of
buried treasure.A vision arises before his eyes of swarthy Portuguese
and Spanish rascals, with black beards and gleaming
eyes--sinister-looking fellows who once on a time haunted the Spanish
Main, sneaking out from some hidden creek in their long, low schooner,
of picaroonish rake and sheer, to attack an unsuspecting trading craft.There were many famous sea rovers in their day, but none more celebrated
than Capt.Perhaps the most fascinating tale of all is Mr.Fitts'
true story of an adventurous American boy, who receives from his dying
father an ancient bit of vellum, which the latter obtained in a curious
way.The document bears obscure directions purporting to locate a
certain island in the Bahama group, and a considerable treasure buried
there by two of Kidd's crew.The hero of this book, Paul Jones Garry, is
an ambitious, persevering lad, of salt-water New England ancestry, and
his efforts to reach the island and secure the money form one of the
most absorbing tales for our youth that has come from the press.+Captain Bayley's Heir+: A Tale of the Gold Fields of California.By
     G. A. HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by H. M. PAGET.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.A frank, manly lad and his cousin are rivals in the heirship of a
considerable property.The former falls into a trap laid by the latter,
and while under a false accusation of theft foolishly leaves England for
America.He works his passage before the mast, joins a small band of
hunters, crosses a tract of country infested with Indians to the
Californian gold diggings, and is successful both as digger and trader.Henty is careful to mingle instruction with entertainment; and
     the humorous touches, especially in the sketch of John Holl, the
     Westminster dustman, Dickens himself could hardly have
     excelled."--_Christian Leader._


     +For Name and Fame+; or, Through Afghan Passes.With
     full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.An interesting story of the last war in Afghanistan.The hero, after
being wrecked and going through many stirring adventures among the
Malays, finds his way to Calcutta and enlists in a regiment proceeding
to join the army at the Afghan passes.He accompanies the force under
General Roberts to the Peiwar Kotal, is wounded, taken prisoner, carried
to Cabul, whence he is transferred to Candahar, and takes part in the
final defeat of the army of Ayoub Khan."The best feature of the book--apart from the interest of its
     scenes of adventure--is its honest effort to do justice to the
     patriotism of the Afghan people."--_Daily News._


     +Captured by Apes+: The Wonderful Adventures of a Young Animal
     Trainer.12mo, cloth, $1.00.The scene of this tale is laid on an island in the Malay Archipelago.Philip Garland, a young animal collector and trainer, of New York, sets
sail for Eastern seas in quest of a new stock of living curiosities.The
vessel is wrecked off the coast of Borneo and young Garland, the sole
survivor of the disaster, is cast ashore on a small island, and captured
by the apes that overrun the place.The lad discovers that the ruling
spirit of the monkey tribe is a gigantic and vicious baboon, whom he
identifies as Goliah, an animal at one time in his possession and with
whose instruction he had been especially diligent.The brute recognizes
him, and with a kind of malignant satisfaction puts his former master
through the same course of training he had himself experienced with a
faithfulness of detail which shows how astonishing is monkey
recollection.Very novel indeed is the way by which the young man
escapes death.Prentice has certainly worked a new vein on juvenile
fiction, and the ability with which he handles a difficult subject
stamps him as a writer of undoubted skill.+The Bravest of the Brave+; or, With Peterborough in Spain.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by H. M. PAGET.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.There are few great leaders whose lives and actions have so completely
fallen into oblivion as those of the Earl of Peterborough.This is
largely due to the fact that they were overshadowed by the glory and
successes of Marlborough.His career as general extended over little
more than a year, and yet, in that time, he showed a genius for warfare
which has never been surpassed.Henty never loses sight of the moral purpose of his work--to
     enforce the doctrine of courage and truth.Lads will read 'The
     Bravest of the Brave' with pleasure and profit; of that we are
     quite sure."--_Daily Telegraph._


     +The Cat of Bubastes+: A Story of Ancient Egypt.With
     full-page Illustrations.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.A story which will give young readers an unsurpassed insight into the
customs of the Egyptian people.Amuba, a prince of the Rebu nation, is
carried with his charioteer Jethro into slavery.They become inmates of
the house of Ameres, the Egyptian high-priest, and are happy in his
service until the priest's son accidentally kills the sacred cat of
Bubastes.In an outburst of popular fury Ameres is killed, and it rests
with Jethro and Amuba to secure the escape of the high-priest's son and
daughter."The story, from the critical moment of the killing of the sacred
     cat to the perilous exodus into Asia with which it closes, is very
     skillfully constructed and full of exciting adventures.It is
     admirably illustrated."--_Saturday Review._


     +With Washington at Monmouth+: A Story of Three Philadelphia Boys.By
     JAMES OTIS.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Three Philadelphia boys, Seth Graydon "whose mother conducted a
boarding-house which was patronized by the British officers;" Enoch
Ball, "son of that Mrs.Ball whose dancing school was situated on
Letitia Street," and little Jacob, son of "Chris, the Baker," serve as
the principal characters.The story is laid during the winter when Lord
Howe held possession of the city, and the lads aid the cause by
assisting the American spies who make regular and frequent visits from
Valley Forge.One reads here of home-life in the captive city when bread
was scarce among the people of the lower classes, and a reckless
prodigality shown by the British officers, who passed the winter in
feasting and merry-making while the members of the patriot army but a
few miles away were suffering from both cold and hunger.The story

     necessity deal with the supernatural, without running into a mere
     riot of fantastic absurdity; but genius Miss Ingelow has and the
     story of 'Jack' is as careless and joyous, but as delicate, as a
     picture of childhood."--_Eclectic._

Within that mew, which for my sake the name
Of famine bears, where others yet must pine,
Already through its opening sev'ral moons
Had shown me, when I slept the evil sleep,
That from the future tore the curtain off.This one, methought, as master of the sport,
Rode forth to chase the gaunt wolf and his whelps
Unto the mountain, which forbids the sight
Of Lucca to the Pisan.With lean brachs
Inquisitive and keen, before him rang'd
Lanfranchi with Sismondi and Gualandi.After short course the father and the sons
Seem'd tir'd and lagging, and methought I saw
The sharp tusks gore their sides.When I awoke
Before the dawn, amid their sleep I heard
My sons (for they were with me) weep and ask
For bread.Right cruel art thou, if no pang
Thou feel at thinking what my heart foretold;
And if not now, why use thy tears to flow?Now had they waken'd; and the hour drew near
When they were wont to bring us food; the mind
Of each misgave him through his dream, and I
Heard, at its outlet underneath lock'd up
The' horrible tower: whence uttering not a word
I look'd upon the visage of my sons.I wept not: so all stone I felt within.They wept: and one, my little Anslem, cried:
"Thou lookest so!Yet
I shed no tear, nor answer'd all that day
Nor the next night, until another sun
Came out upon the world.When a faint beam
Had to our doleful prison made its way,
And in four countenances I descry'd
The image of my own, on either hand
Through agony I bit, and they who thought
I did it through desire of feeding, rose
O' th' sudden, and cried, 'Father, we should grieve
Far less, if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gav'st
These weeds of miserable flesh we wear,

'And do thou strip them off from us again.'Then, not to make them sadder, I kept down
My spirit in stillness.That day and the next
We all were silent.When we came
To the fourth day, then Geddo at my feet
Outstretch'd did fling him, crying, 'Hast no help
For me, my father!'There he died, and e'en
Plainly as thou seest me, saw I the three
Fall one by one 'twixt the fifth day and sixth:

"Whence I betook me now grown blind to grope

Call'd on them who were dead.Thus having spoke,

Once more upon the wretched skull his teeth

Firm and unyielding.shame
Of all the people, who their dwelling make
In that fair region, where th' Italian voice
Is heard, since that thy neighbours are so slack
To punish, from their deep foundations rise
Capraia and Gorgona, and dam up
The mouth of Arno, that each soul in thee
May perish in the waters!What if fame
Reported that thy castles were betray'd
By Ugolino, yet no right hadst thou
To stretch his children on the rack.For them,
Brigata, Ugaccione, and the pair
Of gentle ones, of whom my song hath told,
Their tender years, thou modern Thebes!Onward we pass'd,
Where others skarf'd in rugged folds of ice
Not on their feet were turn'd, but each revers'd.There very weeping suffers not to weep;
For at their eyes grief seeking passage finds
Impediment, and rolling inward turns
For increase of sharp anguish: the first tears
Hang cluster'd, and like crystal vizors show,
Under the socket brimming all the cup.Now though the cold had from my face dislodg'd
Each feeling, as 't were callous, yet me seem'd

Said I, "my master?Is not here below

He answer'd, "where thine eye shall tell thee whence
The cause descrying of this airy shower."Then cried out one in the chill crust who mourn'd:
"O souls so cruel!that the farthest post
Hath been assign'd you, from this face remove
The harden'd veil, that I may vent the grief
Impregnate at my heart, some little space
Ere it congeal again!"I thus replied:
"Say who thou wast, if thou wouldst have mine aid;
And if I extricate thee not, far down
As to the lowest ice may I descend!""The friar Alberigo," answered he,
"Am I, who from the evil garden pluck'd
Its fruitage, and am here repaid, the date
More luscious for my fig."--"Hah!"I exclaim'd,
"Art thou too dead!"--"How in the world aloft
It fareth with my body," answer'd he,
"I am right ignorant.Such privilege
Hath Ptolomea, that ofttimes the soul
Drops hither, ere by Atropos divorc'd.And that thou mayst wipe out more willingly

Doth yet appear the body of a ghost,
Who here behind me winters.Him thou know'st,
If thou but newly art arriv'd below.The years are many that have pass'd away,
Since to this fastness Branca Doria came.""Now," answer'd I, "methinks thou mockest me,
For Branca Doria never yet hath died,
But doth all natural functions of a man,
Eats, drinks, and sleeps, and putteth raiment on."He thus: "Not yet unto that upper foss

"THE banners of Hell's Monarch do come forth
Towards us; therefore look," so spake my guide,
"If thou discern him."As, when breathes a cloud
Heavy and dense, or when the shades of night
Fall on our hemisphere, seems view'd from far
A windmill, which the blast stirs briskly round,
Such was the fabric then methought I saw,

To shield me from the wind, forthwith I drew
Behind my guide: no covert else was there.Now came I (and with fear I bid my strain
Record the marvel) where the souls were all
Whelm'd underneath, transparent, as through glass
Pellucid the frail stem.Some prone were laid,
Others stood upright, this upon the soles,
That on his head, a third with face to feet
Arch'd like a bow.When to the point we came,
Whereat my guide was pleas'd that I should see
The creature eminent in beauty once,
He from before me stepp'd and made me pause.and lo the place,
Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength."How frozen and how faint I then became,
Ask me not, reader!for I write it not,
Since words would fail to tell thee of my state.Think thyself
If quick conception work in thee at all,
How I did feel.That emperor, who sways
The realm of sorrow, at mid breast from th' ice
Stood forth; and I in stature am more like
A giant, than the giants are in his arms.Mark now how great that whole must be, which suits
With such a part.If he were beautiful
As he is hideous now, and yet did dare
To scowl upon his Maker, well from him
May all our mis'ry flow.How passing strange it seem'd, when I did spy
Upon his head three faces: one in front
Of hue vermilion, th' other two with this
Midway each shoulder join'd and at the crest;
The right 'twixt wan and yellow seem'd: the left
To look on, such as come from whence old Nile
Stoops to the lowlands.Under each shot forth
Two mighty wings, enormous as became
A bird so vast.Sails never such I saw
Outstretch'd on the wide sea.No plumes had they,
But were in texture like a bat, and these
He flapp'd i' th' air, that from him issued still
Three winds, wherewith Cocytus to its depth
Was frozen.At six eyes he wept: the tears
Adown three chins distill'd with bloody foam.At every mouth his teeth a sinner champ'd
Bruis'd as with pond'rous engine, so that three
Were in this guise tormented.But far more
Than from that gnawing, was the foremost pang'd
By the fierce rending, whence ofttimes the back
Was stript of all its skin."That upper spirit,
Who hath worse punishment," so spake my guide,
"Is Judas, he that hath his head within
And plies the feet without.Of th' other two,
Whose heads are under, from the murky jaw
Who hangs, is Brutus: lo!how he doth writhe
And speaks not!Th' other Cassius, that appears
So large of limb.But night now re-ascends,
And it is time for parting.I clipp'd him round the neck, for so he bade;
And noting time and place, he, when the wings
Enough were op'd, caught fast the shaggy sides,
And down from pile to pile descending stepp'd
Between the thick fell and the jagged ice.Soon as he reach'd the point, whereat the thigh
Upon the swelling of the haunches turns,
My leader there with pain and struggling hard
Turn'd round his head, where his feet stood before,
And grappled at the fell, as one who mounts,
That into hell methought we turn'd again."Expect that by such stairs as these," thus spake
The teacher, panting like a man forespent,
"We must depart from evil so extreme."Then at a rocky opening issued forth,
And plac'd me on a brink to sit, next join'd
With wary step my side.I rais'd mine eyes,
Believing that I Lucifer should see
Where he was lately left, but saw him now
With legs held upward.Let the grosser sort,
Who see not what the point was I had pass'd,
Bethink them if sore toil oppress'd me then."Arise," my master cried, "upon thy feet.The way is long, and much uncouth the road;
And now within one hour and half of noon
The sun returns."It was no palace-hall
Lofty and luminous wherein we stood,
But natural dungeon where ill footing was
And scant supply of light."Ere from th' abyss
I sep'rate," thus when risen I began,
"My guide!vouchsafe few words to set me free
From error's thralldom.How standeth he in posture thus revers'd?And how from eve to morn in space so brief
Hath the sun made his transit?"He in few
Thus answering spake: "Thou deemest thou art still
On th' other side the centre, where I grasp'd
Th' abhorred worm, that boreth through the world.Thou wast on th' other side, so long as I
Descended; when I turn'd, thou didst o'erpass
That point, to which from ev'ry part is dragg'd
All heavy substance.Thou art now arriv'd
Under the hemisphere opposed to that,
Which the great continent doth overspread,
And underneath whose canopy expir'd
The Man, that was born sinless, and so liv'd.Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere,
Whose other aspect is Judecca.Morn
Here rises, when there evening sets: and he,
Whose shaggy pile was scal'd, yet standeth fix'd,
As at the first.On this part he fell down
From heav'n; and th' earth, here prominent before,
Through fear of him did veil her with the sea,
And to our hemisphere retir'd.Perchance
To shun him was the vacant space left here
By what of firm land on this side appears,
That sprang aloof."There is a place beneath,
From Belzebub as distant, as extends
The vaulted tomb, discover'd not by sight,
But by the sound of brooklet, that descends
This way along the hollow of a rock,
Which, as it winds with no precipitous course,
The wave hath eaten.By that hidden way
My guide and I did enter, to return
To the fair world: and heedless of repose
We climbed, he first, I following his steps,
Till on our view the beautiful lights of heav'n
Dawn'd through a circular opening in the cave:
Thus issuing we again beheld the stars.Among all the noble men of those heroic times, I, for my part, like to
think of old John Pierpont, the minister poet, who broke bread at my
mother’s table.Whether this predilection is due to prenatal causes,
some Oliver Wendell Holmes may decide.Certain it is that I was born in
September, 1868, and in the preceding April my mother wrote:

          O dear anemone, and violet fair,
            Beloved hepatica, arbutus sweet!Two years ago I twined your graces rare,
            And laid the garland at the poet’s feet.The grand old poet on whose brow the snow
            Of eighty winters lay in purest white,
          But in whose heart was held the added glow
            Of eighty summers full of warmth and light.Like some fair tree within the tropic clime
            In whose green boughs the spring and autumn meet,
          Where wreaths of bloom around the ripe fruits twine,
            And promise with fulfilment stands complete,

          So twined around the ripeness of his thought
            An ever-springing verdure and perfume,
          All his rich fullness from October caught
            And all her freshness from the heart of June.But last year when the sweet wild flowers awoke
            And opened their dear petals to the sun,
          He was not here, but every flow’ret spoke
            An odorous breath of him the missing one.Of this effusion John Greenleaf Whittier—to whom the verses were
addressed—graciously wrote:

    The first four verses of thy poem are not only very beautiful from
    an artistic point of view, but are wonderfully true of the man they
    describe.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                              CHAPTER XIV.––––––
                          THE GAY STREET HOME.In November, 1867, the Halls bought the Captain Peters’ place, No.18
Gay Street, Georgetown, and for twenty-five years, that is, for the rest
of Angeline Hall’s life, this was her home.The two-story brick house,
covered with white stucco, and having a shingled roof, stood in the
centre of a generous yard, looking southward.Wooden steps led up to a
square front porch, the roof of which was supported by large wooden
pillars.The front door opened into a hall, with parlor on the right
hand and sitting room on the left.Back of the sitting room was the
dining room, and back of that the kitchen.In the year of the
Centennial, 1876, the house was enlarged to three stories, with a flat
tin roof, and three bay-windows were added, one in the dining room and
two in front of the house, and the front porch was lengthened so as to
extend from one bay window to the other.The new house was heated
chiefly by a furnace and a large kitchen range, but in the dining room
and sitting room grates were put in for open coal fires.The two rooms
were thrown together by sliding doors, and became the centre of home
comfort; though the room over the sitting room, where, in a low
cane-seated rocking chair of oak, Mrs.Hall sat and did the family
sewing, was of almost equal importance.In the sitting room hung the
old-fashioned German looking-glass with its carved and gilded frame, the
gift of Dr.Over the fire-place was an engraving of Lincoln,
and in one corner of the room was the round mahogany table where
Professor Hall played whist with his boys.Over the dining room mantle
hung a winter scene painted by some relative of the family, and in the
bay window stood Mrs.[Illustration: THE GAY STREET HOME]


In the front yard was a large black-heart cherry tree, where house-wrens
built their nests, a crab-apple tree that blossomed prodigiously, a
damson plum, peach trees, box-trees and evergreens.The walks were
bordered with flower beds, where roses and petunias, verbenas and
geraniums, portulacas and mignonnette blossomed in profusion.In the
back yard was a large English walnut tree, from the branches of which
the little Halls used to shoot the ripe nuts with their bows and arrows.In another part of the back yard was Mrs.Hall’s hot-bed, with its seven
long sashes, under which tender garden plants were protected during the
winter, and sweet English violets bloomed.Along the sidewalk in front
of the premises was a row of rather stunted rock-maples; for the
Southern soil seemed but grudgingly to nourish the Northern trees.Such, in bare outline, was the Gay Street home.Here on September 16,
1868, the third child, Angelo, was born.Among the boys of the
neighborhood 18 Gay Street became known as the residence of “Asaph, Sam,
and Angelico.” This euphonious and rhythmical combination of names held
good for four years exactly, when, on September 16, 1872, the fourth and
last child, Percival, was born.One of my earliest recollections is the
sight of a red, new-born infant held in my father’s hands.It has been
humorously maintained that it was my parents’ design to spell out the
name “Asaph” with the initials of his children.I am inclined to
discredit the idea, though the pleasantry was current in my boyhood, and
the fifth letter,—which might, of course, be said to stand for Hall,—was
supplied by Henry S. Pritchett, who as a young man became a member of
the family, as much attached to Mrs.In fact, when
Asaph was away at college, little Percival used to say there were five
boys in the family _counting Asaph_.As a curious commentary upon this
letter game, I will add that my own little boy Llewellyn used to
pronounce his grandfather’s name “Apas.” Blood is thicker than water,
and though the letters here are slightly mixed, the proper four, and
four only, are employed.So it came to pass that Angeline Hall reared her four sons in the
unheard-of and insignificant little city of Georgetown, whose sole claim
to distinction is that it was once the home of Francis Scott Key.What a
pity the Hall boys were not brought up in Massachusetts!And yet how
glad I am that we were not!In Georgetown Angeline Hall trained her sons
with entire freedom from New England educational fads; and for her sake
Georgetown is to them profoundly sacred.Here it was that this woman of
gentle voice, iron will, and utmost purity of character instilled in her
growing boys moral principles that should outlast a lifetime.One day
when about six years old I set out to annihilate my brother Sam.I had a
chunk of wood as big as my head with which I purposed to kill him.He
happened to be too nimble for me, so that the fury of my rage was
ungratified.She told me in heartfelt words the inevitable consequences of such
actions—and from that day dated my absolute submission to her authority.In this connection it will not be amiss to quote the words of Mrs.John
R. Eastman, for thirteen years our next-door neighbor:

    During the long days of our long summers, when windows and doors
    were open, and the little ones at play out of doors often claimed a
    word from her, I lived literally within sound of her voice from day
    to day.Never once did I hear it raised in anger, and its sweetness,
    and steady, even tones, were one of her chief and abiding charms.The fact is, Angeline Hall rather over-did the inculcation of Christian
principles.Like Tolstoi she taught the absolute wickedness of fighting,
instead of the manly duty of self-defense.And yet, I think my brothers
suffered no evil consequences.Perhaps the secret of her
great influence over us was that she demanded the absolute truth.Dishonesty in word or act was out of the question.In two instances, I
remember, I lied to her; for in moral strength I was not the equal of
George Washington.But those lies weighed heavily on my conscience, till
at last, after many years, I confessed to her.If she demanded truth and obedience from her sons, she gave to them her
absolute devotion.Miracles of healing were performed in her household.By sheer force of character, by continual watchings and utmost care in
dieting, she rescued me from a hopeless case of dysentery in the fifth
year of my age.The old Navy doctor called it a miracle, and so it was.Serious sickness was uncommon in
our family, as is illustrated by the fact that, for periods of three
years each, not one of her four boys was ever late to school, though the
distance thither was a mile or two.When Percival, coasting down one of
the steep hills of Georgetown, ran into a street car and was brought
home half stunned, with one front tooth knocked out and gone and another
badly loosened, Angeline Hall repaired to the scene of the accident
early the next morning, found the missing tooth, and had the family
dentist restore it to its place.There it has done good service for
twenty years.Is it any wonder that such a woman should have insisted
upon her husband’s discovering the satellites of Mars?Perhaps the secret of success in the moral training of her sons lay in
her generalship.In house and yard there was
work to do, and she marshaled her boys to do it.Like a good general she
was far more efficient than any of her soldiers, but under her
leadership they did wonders.Sweeping, dusting, making beds, washing
dishes, sifting ashes, going to market, running errands, weeding the
garden, chopping wood, beating carpets, mending fences, cleaning
house—there was hardly a piece of work indoors or out with which they
were unfamiliar.There was abundance
of leisure for all sorts of diversions, including swimming and skating,
two forms of exercise which struck terror to the mother heart, but in
which, through her self-sacrifice, they indulged quite freely.Their leisure was purchased by her labor; for until they were of
academic age she was their school teacher.In an hour or two a day they
mastered the three R’s and many things besides.Nor did they suffer from
too little teaching, for at the preparatory school each of them in turn
led his class, and at Harvard College all four sons graduated with
distinction.How few mothers have so
proud a record, and how impossible would such an achievement have seemed
to any observer who had seen the collapse of this frail woman at
McGrawville!But as each successive son completed his college course it
was as if she herself had done it—her moral training had supplied the
incentive, her teaching and encouragement had started the lad in his
studies, when he went to school her motherly care had provided
nourishing food and warm clothing, when he went to college her frugality
had saved up the necessary money.She used to say, “Somebody has got to
make a sacrifice,” and she sacrificed herself.It is good to know that
on Christmas Day, 1891, half a year before she died, she broke bread
with husband and all four sons at the old Georgetown home.Let it not be supposed that Angeline Hall reached the perfection of
motherhood.The Gay Street home was the embodiment
of her spirit; and as she was a Puritan, her sons suffered sometimes
from her excess of Puritanism.They neither drank nor used tobacco; but
fortunately their father taught them to play cards.Their mother brought
them up to believe in woman suffrage; but fortunately Cupid provided
them wives regardless of such creed.She taught them to eschew pride,
sending them to gather leaves in the streets, covering their garments
with patches, discouraging the use of razors on incipient beards; but
fortunately a boy’s companions take such nonsense out of him.She even
left a case of chills and fever to the misdirected mercies of a woman
doctor, a homœopathist.I myself was the victim, and for twenty-five
years I have abhorred women homœopathic physicians.But such trivial faults are not to be compared with the depths of a
mother’s love.To all that is intrinsically noble and beautiful she was
keenly sensitive.How good it was to see her exult in the glories of a
Maryland sunset—viewed from the housetop with her boys about her.And
how strange that this timid woman could allow them to risk their
precious necks on the roof of a three-story house!Perhaps her passion for the beautiful was most strikingly displayed in
the cultivation of her garden.To each son she dedicated a rose-bush.There was one for her husband and another for his mother.In a shady
part of the yard grew lilies of the valley; and gladiolas, Easter lilies
and other varieties of lilies were scattered here and there.In the
early spring there were crocuses and hyacinths and daffodils.Vines
trailed along the fences and climbed the sides of the house.She was
especially fond of her English ivy.Honeysuckles flourished, hollyhocks
ran riot even in the front yard, morning-glories blossomed west of the
house, by the front porch grew a sweet-briar rose with its fragrant
leaves, and by the bay windows bloomed blue and white wisterias.A
magnolia bush stood near the parlor window, a forsythia by the front
fence, and by the side alley a beautiful flowering bush with a dome of
white blossoms.The flower beds were literally crowded, so that humming
birds, in their gorgeous plumage, were frequent visitors.Hall had loved the wild flowers of her native woods and fields; and
in the woods back of Georgetown she sought out her old friends and
brought them home to take root in her yard, coaxing their growth with
rich wood’s earth, found in the decayed stump of some old tree.Thus the following poem, like all her poems, was but the expression of
herself:

                              ASPIRATION.The violet dreams forever of the sky,
            Until at last she wakens wondrous fair,
          With heaven’s own azure in her dewy eye,
            And heaven’s own fragrance in her earthly air.The lily folds close in her heart the beams
            That the pure stars reach to her deeps below,
          Till o’er the waves her answering brightness gleams—
            A star hath flowered within her breast of snow.The rose that watches at the gates of morn,
            While pours through heaven the splendor of the sun,
          Needs none to tell us whence her strength is born,
            Nor where her crown of glory she hath won.And every flower that blooms on hill or plain
            In the dull soil hath most divinely wrought
          To haunting perfume or to heavenly stain
            The sweetness born of her aspiring thought.With what expectancy we wait the hour
          When all the hopes to which thou dost aspire
            Shall in the holiness of beauty flower.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                              CHAPTER XV.––––––
                           AN AMERICAN WOMAN.The desire of knowledge is a powerful instinct of the soul, as
    inherent in woman as in man.... It was designed to be gratified, all
    the avenues of her soul are open for its gratification.Her every
    sense is as perfect as man’s: her hand is as delicate in its touch,
    her ear as acute in hearing, her eye the same in its wonderful
    mechanism, her brain sends out the same two-fold telegraphic
    network.She is endowed with the same consciousness, the same power
    of perception.From her
    very organization she is manifestly formed for the pursuit of the
    same knowledge, for the attainment of the same virtue, for the
    unfolding of the same truth.Whatever aids man in the pursuit of any
    one of these objects must aid her also.Let woman then reject the
    philosophy of a narrow prejudice or of false custom, and trust
    implicitly to God’s glorious handwriting on every folded tissue of
    her body, on every tablet of her soul.Let her seek for the highest
    culture of brain and heart.Let her apply her talent to the highest
    use.In so doing will the harmony of her being be perfect.Brain and
    heart according well will make one music.All the bright
    intellections of the mind, all the beautiful affections of the heart
    will together form one perfect crystal around the pole of Truth.From these words of hers it appears that Angeline Hall believed in a
well-rounded life for women as well as for men; and to the best of her
ability she lived up to her creed.Physically deficient herself, she
heralded the advent of the American woman—the peer of Spartan mother,
Roman matron or modern European dame.Her ideal could hardly be called
“the new woman,” for she fulfilled the duties of wife and mother with
the utmost devotion.Among college women she was a pioneer; and perhaps
the best type of college woman corresponds to her ideal.[Illustration: PHOTOGRAPH OF 1878]


In person she was not remarkable—height about five feet three inches,
weight with clothing about one hundred and twenty-three pounds.In
middle life she was considerably bent over, more from years of toil than
from physical weakness.Nervous strength was lacking; and early in life
she lost her teeth.But her frame was well developed, her waist being as
large as a Greek goddess’s, for she scorned the use of corsets.Her
smooth skin was of fine stout texture.Her well-shaped head was adorned
by thin curls of wonderfully fine, dark hair, which even at the time of
death showed hardly a trace of white.Straight mouth, high forehead,
strong brow, large straight nose, and beautiful brown eyes indicated a
woman of great spiritual force.She cared little for adornment, believing that the person is attractive
if the soul is good.Timid in the face of physical danger, she was
endowed with great moral courage and invincible resolution.She used to
speak of “going along and doing something,” and of “doing a little every
day.” Friends and relatives found in her a wise counsellor and fearless
leader.She was gifted with intellect of a high order—an unquenchable
thirst for knowledge, a good memory, excellent mathematical ability, and
the capacity for mental labor.But her sense of duty controlled, and she
devoted her talents to the service of others.Unlike Lady Macbeth in other respects, she was suited to bear
men-children.And, thanks to her true womanhood, she nursed them at the
breast.There were no bottle babies in the Hall family.Tradition has it
that she endured the pains of childbirth with unusual fortitude, hardly
needing a physician.But this seeming strength was due in part to an
unwise modesty.With hardly enough strength for the duties of each day, she did work
enough for two women through sheer force of will.It is not surprising
then that she died, in the sixty-second year of her age, from a stroke
of apoplexy.She was by no means apoplectic in appearance, being rather
a pale person; but the blood-vessels of the brain were worn out and
could no longer withstand the pressure.In the fall of 1881, after the
death of her sister Mary and of Nellie Woodward, daughter of her sister
Ruth, she was the victim of a serious sickness, which continued for six
months or more.Friends thought she would die; but her sister Ruth came
and took care of her, and saved her for ten more years of usefulness.She lived to see her youngest son through college, attended his Class
Day, and died a few days after his graduation.The motive power of her life was religious faith—a faith that outgrew
all forms of superstition.Brought up to accept the narrow theology of
her mother’s church, she became a Unitarian.The eldest son was sent
regularly to the Unitarian Sunday School in Washington; but a quarrel
arising in the church, she quietly withdrew, and thereafter assumed the
whole responsibility of training her sons in Christian morals.Subsequently she took a keen interest in the Concord School of
Philosophy; and, adopting her husband’s view, she looked to science for
the regeneration of mankind.In this she was not altogether wise, for
her own experience had proven that the advancement of knowledge depends
upon a divine enthusiasm, which must be fed by a religion of some sort.Fortunately, she was possessed of a poetic soul, and she never lost
religious feeling.The following poem illustrates very well the faith of her later life:

                              TO SCIENCE.I.

         Friend of our race, O Science, strong and wise!Though thou wast scorned and wronged and sorely tried,
         Bound and imprisoned, racked and crucified,
         Thou dost in life invulnerable rise
         The glorious leader ’gainst our enemies.Thou art Truth’s champion for the domain wide
         Ye twain shall conquer fighting side by side.Thus thou art strong, and able thou to cope
         With all thy enemies that yet remain.They fly already from the open plain,
         And climb, hard-pressed, far up the rugged <DW72>.We hear thy bugle sound o’er land and sea
         And know that victory abides with thee.Because thou’st conquered all _one_ little world
           Thou never like the ancient king dost weep,
           But like the brave Ulysses, on the deep
           Dost launch thy bark, and, all its sails unfurled,
           Dost search for new worlds which may lie impearled
           By happy islands where the billows sleep;
           Or into sunless seas dost fearless sweep,
           Braving the tempest which is round thee hurled;
           Or, bolder still, mounting where far stars shine,
           From conquest unto conquest thou dost rise
           And hold’st dominion over realms divine,
           Where, clear defined unto thy piercing eyes,
           And fairer than Faith’s yearnful heart did ween
           Stretches the vastness of the great Unseen.E’en where thy sight doth fail thou givest not o’er,
          But still “beyond the red” thy spectraphone
          The ray invisible transforms to tone,
          Thus winning from the silence more and more;
          Wherein thou buildest new worlds from shore to shore
          With hills perpetual and with mountains lone;
          To music moving pond’rous stone on stone
          As unto Orpheus’ lyre they moved of yore.Beyond the farthest sweep of farthest sun,
          Beyond the music of the sounding spheres
          Which chant the measures of the months and years,
          Toward realms that e’en to daring Thought are new
          Still let thy flying feet unwearied run.let her not deem thee foe,
           Though thou dost drive her from the Paradise
           To which she clings with backward turning eyes,
           Thou art her angel still, and biddest her go
           To wider lands where the great rivers flow,
           And broad and green many a valley lies,
           Where high and grand th’ eternal mountains rise,
           And oceans fathomless surge to and fro.Thus thou dost teach her that God’s true and real,
           Fairer and grander than her dreams _must_ be;
           Till she shall leave the realm of the Ideal
           To follow Truth throughout the world with thee,
           Through earth and sea and up beyond the sun
           Until the mystery of God is won.Whatever the literary defects, these are noble sonnets.But I had rather
take my chances in a good Unitarian church than try to nourish the soul
with such Platonic love of God.She disliked the Unitarian habit of
clinging to church traditions and ancient forms of worship; but better
these than the materialism of a scientific age.She was absolutely loyal to truth, not
guilty of that shuffling attitude of modern theologians who have
outgrown the superstition of Old Testament only to cling more
tenaciously to the superstition of the New.In the Concord School of
Philosophy, and later in her studies as a member of the Ladies’
Historical Society of Washington, she was searching for the new faith
that should fulfil the old.It might be of interest here to introduce
selections from some of her Historical Society essays, into the
composition of which she entered with great earnestness.Written toward
the close of life, they still retain the freshness and unspoiled
enthusiasm of youth.One specimen must suffice:

    In thinking of Galileo, and the office of the telescope, which is to
    give us increase of light, and of the increasing power of the larger
    and larger lenses, which widens our horizon to infinity, this
    constantly recurring thought comes to me: how shall we grow into the
    immensity that is opening before us?The principle of light pervades
    all space—it travels from star to star and makes known to us all
    objects on earth and in heaven.The great ether throbs and thrills
    with its burden to the remotest star as with a joy.But there is
    also an all-pervading force, so subtle that we know not yet how it
    passes through the illimitable space.But before it all worlds fall
    into divine order and harmony.It imparts the
    power of one to all, and gathers from all for the one.What in the
    soul answers to these two principles is, first, also light or
    knowledge, by which all things are unveiled; the other which answers
    to gravitation, and before which all shall come into proper
    relations, and into the heavenly harmony, and by which we shall fill
    the heavens with ourselves, and ourselves with heaven, is love.But after all, Angeline Hall gave
herself to duty and not to philosophy—to the plain, monotonous work of
home and neighborhood.Like the virtuous woman of Scripture, she
supplied with her own hands the various family wants—cooked with great
skill, canned abundance of fruit for winter, and supplied the table from
day to day with plain, wholesome food.Would that she might have taught
Bostonians to bake beans!If they would try her method, they would
discover that a mutton bone is an excellent substitute for pork.Pork
and lard she banished from her kitchen.Beef suet is, indeed, much
cleaner.The chief article of diet was meat, for Mrs.Hall was no
vegetarian, and the Georgetown markets supplied the best of Virginia
beef and mutton.Like the virtuous woman of Scripture, she provided the
family with warm clothing, and kept it in repair.A large part of her
life was literally spent in mending clothes.She never relaxed the rigid
economy of Cambridge days.She commonly needed but one servant, for she
worked with her own hands and taught her sons to help her.The house was
always substantially clean from roof to cellar.Nowhere on the whole premises was a bad smell tolerated.While family wants were scrupulously attended to, she stretched forth a
hand to the poor.The Civil War filled Washington with <DW64>s, and for
several winters Mrs.In
1872 she was “Directress” of the tenth, eleventh and twelfth wards; and
for a long time she was a member of a benevolent society in Georgetown,
having charge of a section of the city near her residence.For the last
fourteen years of her life, she visited the Home for Destitute <DW52>
Women and Children in north Washington.Her poor <DW52> neighbors
regarded her with much esteem.She listened to their stories of
distress, comforted them, advised them.The aged she admitted to her
warm kitchen; and they went away, victuals in their baskets or coins in
their hands, with the sense of having a friend in Mrs.Uncle
Louis, said to be one hundred and fourteen years old, rewarded her with
a grape-vine, which was planted by the dining room window.And “the
Uncle Louis grape” was the best in the garden.At the close of the Civil War she even undertook to redeem two fallen
Irish women by taking them into her house to work.But their appetite
for whiskey was too strong, and they would steal butter, barter it for
liquor, and come home drunk.On one occasion one of these women took
little Asaph along to visit the saloon; and there his mother found him,
with the servant standing by joking with rough men, her dress in shreds.Hall had no time or strength for such charitable enterprises, and
soon abandoned them.She was saved from most of the follies of
philanthropy by the good sense of her husband, whom she rewarded with
the devotion of a faithful wife.His studies and researches, almost from
the first, were much too deep for her entire comprehension, but she was
always enthusiastic about his work.In the introduction to his
“_Observations and Orbits of the Satellites of Mars_,” Professor Hall
chivalrously says:

    In the spring of 1877, the approaching favorable opposition of the
    planet Mars attracted my attention, and the idea occurred to me of
    making a careful search with our large Clark refractor for a
    satellite of this planet.An examination of the literature of the
    planet showed, however, such a mass of observations of various
    kinds, made by the most experienced and skillful astronomers that
    the chance of finding a satellite appeared to be very slight, so
    that I might have abandoned the search had it not been for the
    encouragement of my wife.Each night she sent her
husband to the observatory supplied with a nourishing lunch, and each
night she awaited developments with eager interest.I can well remember
the excitement at home.There was a great secret in the house, and all
the members of the family were drawn more closely together by mutual
confidence.The moral and intellectual training of her sons has already been
referred to.Summer vacations were often spent with her sisters in
Rodman, N.Y.Her mother, who reached the age of eighty years, died in
the summer of 1878, when Mrs.Hall became the head of the Stickney
family.Her sisters Mary and Elmina were childless.Ruth had six
children, in whose welfare their Aunt Angeline took a lively interest.The three girls each spent a winter with her in Washington, and when, in
the summer of 1881, Nellie was seized with a fatal illness, Aunt
Angeline was present to care for her.Now and then Charlotte Ingalls,
who had prospered in Wisconsin, would come on from the West, and the
Stickney sisters would all be together.The last reunion occurred in the
summer of 1891, a year previous to Angeline’s death.It was a goodly
sight to see the sisters in one wagon, near the old home place; and
when, at Elmina’s house, Angeline was bustling about attending to the
needs of the united family, it was good to hear Charlotte exclaim, “Take
care, old lady!” She was thirteen years older than Angeline, and seemed
almost to belong to an earlier generation.She remembered her father
well, and had no doubt acquired from him some of the ancient New
Hampshire customs lost to her younger sisters.Certainly her
exclamations of “Fiddlesticks,” and “Witch-cats,” were quaint and
picturesque.But it was Angeline who was really best versed in the family history.She had made a study of it, in all its branches, and could trace her
descent from at least eleven worthy Englishmen, most of whom arrived in
New England before 1650.She made excursions to various points in New
England in search of relatives.At Belchertown, Mass., in 1884, she
found her grandfather Cook’s first cousin, Mr.He was then
one hundred years old, and remembered how in boyhood he used to go
skating with Elisha Cook.How brief the history of America in the presence of such a man!I
remember seeing an old New Englander, as late as 1900, who as a boy of
eleven years had seen General Lafayette.It was a treat to hear him
describe the courteous Frenchman, slight of stature, bent with age, but
active and polite enough to alight from the stage-coach to shake hands
with the people assembled to welcome him in the little village of
Charlton, Mass.At the close of life she longed to
visit Europe, but death intervened, and her days were spent in her
native country.She passed two summers in the mountains of Virginia.In
1878, with her little son Percival, she accompanied her husband to
Colorado, to observe the total eclipse of the sun.Three years before
they had taken the whole family to visit her sister Charlotte’s people
in Wisconsin.It was through her family loyalty that she acquired the Adirondack
habit.In the summer of 1882, after the severe sickness of the preceding
winter, she was staying with a cousin’s son, a country doctor, in
Washington County, N.Y.He proposed an outing in the invigorating air of
the Adirondacks.And so, with her three youngest sons and the doctor’s
family, she drove to Indian Lake, and camped there about a week.Her
improvement was so marked that the next summer, accompanied by three
sons and her sister Ruth, she drove into the wilderness from the West,
camping a few days in a log cabin by the side of Piseco Lake.In 1885,
setting out from Rodman again, she drove four hundred miles, passing
north of the mountains to Paul Smith’s, and thence to Saranac Lake
village, John Brown’s farm, Keene Valley, and Lake George, and returning
by way of the Mohawk Valley.In 1888 she camped with the three youngest
sons on Lower Saranac, and in 1890 she spent July and August at the
summer school of Thomas Davidson, on the side of Mt.One day
I escorted her and her friend Miss Sarah Waitt to the top of the
mountain, four or five miles distant, and we spent the night on the
summit before a blazing camp-fire.Two years later she was planning
another Adirondack trip when death overtook her—at the house of her
friend Mrs.Berrien, at North Andover, Mass., July 3, 1892.Her poem “Heracles,” written towards the close of her career, fittingly
describes her own herculean labors:

                               HERACLES.I.

           Genius of labor, mighty Heracles!Though bound by fate to do another’s will,
           Not basely, as a slave, dost thou fulfil
           The appointed task.The eye of God to please
           Thou seekest, and man to bless, and not thy ease.So to thy wearying toil thou addest still
           New labors, to redeem some soul from ill,
           Performing all thy generous mind conceives.From the sea-monster’s jaws thy arm did free,
           And from her chains, the fair Hesione.And when Alcestis, who her lord to save,
           Her life instead a sacrifice she gave,
           Then wast thou near with heart that never quailed,
           And o’er Death’s fearful form thy might prevailed.Because thou chosest virtue, when for thee
            Vice her alluring charms around thee spread,
            The gods, approving, smiled from overhead,
            And gave to thee thy shining panoply.Nature obedient to thy will was led,
            Out rushed the rivers from their ancient bed
            And washed the filth of earth into the sea.When ’gainst thy foes thy arrows all were spent,
            Zeus stones instead, in whirling snow-cloud sent.When with sore heat oppressed, O wearied one!Thou thought’st to aim thy arrows at the sun,
            Then Helios sent his golden boat to thee
            To bear thee safely through the trackless sea.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                              CHAPTER XVI.––––––
                          A BUNDLE OF LETTERS.The letters of Angeline Hall are genuine letters—not meant for
publication, but for the eyes of the persons addressed.The style, even
the spelling and punctuation, are faulty; and the subject-matter in most
cases can have no general interest.However, I have selected a few of
her letters, which I trust will be readable, and which may help to give
a truer conception of the astronomer’s wife:

                                                   RODMAN, July 26, ’66.DEAREST ASAPH: I am at Mother’s this morning.Staid over to help see
    to Ruth, and now cannot get back over to Elminas, all so busy at
    their work, have no time to carry me, then Franklin is sick half the
    time.I shall probably get over there in a day or two.I have had no
    letters from you since a week ago last night, have had no
    opportunity to send to the Office.Franklin has finished his haying but
    has a little hoing to do yet—Constant is trying to get his work
    along so that he will be ready to take you around when you come.He
    wishes you to write when you will come so that he can arrange his
    work accordingly.I hope you will come by the middle of August.He thinks you
    have forsaken him.When I ask him now where is papa, he says “no
    papa.” I have weaned him.He stayed with Aunt Mary three nights
    while I was taking care of Ruth.He eats his bread and milk very
    well now.Little “A” has been a very good boy indeed, a real little
    man.I bought him and Homer some nice bows and arrows of an Indian
    who brought them into the cars to sell just this side of Rome, so
    that he shoots at a mark with Grandfather Woodward.I suppose Adelaide starts for Goshen next week.I have received two
    letters from her.Now do come up here as soon as you can.I do not enjoy my visit half
    so well without you.I am going out with Mary after raspberries this
    morning—Little Samie is very fond of them.Affectionately

                ANGELINE HALL.28 (1868)

    DEAR SISTER MARY, Little Angelo is only twelve days old, but he is
    as bright and smart as can be.I have washed and dressed him for
    four days myself.I have been down to the gate to-day.And have
    sewed most all day, so you see I am pretty well.To day is Samie’s birthday, four years old—he is quite well and
    happy—The baby he says is his.I should like very much to take a peep at you in
    your new home.We like our old place better and
    better all the time.You must write to me as soon as you can.Do you
    get your mail at Adams Centre?Have you any apples in that vicinity
    this year?Hall has just been reading in the newspaper a sketch of Henry
    Keep’s life which says he was once in the Jefferson Co.Poor house,
    is it true?Much love to you all

                ANGELINE HALL.GEORGETOWN March 3rd 1871

    DEAR SISTER MARY: We received your letter, also the tub of apples
    and cider.I have made some apple sauce, it is splendid.I have not
    had one bit of boiled cider apple sauce before since we came to
    Washington.I shall try to pay you for all your expense and trouble
    sometime.I would send you some fresh shad if I was sure it would
    keep to get to you.We had some shad salted last spring but it is
    not very nice.I think was not put up quite right, so it is hardly
    fit to send.Samie has had a little ear-ache this week but
    is better.Angelo is the nicest little boy you ever saw.A man came to spade the ground to sow
    our peas but it began to rain just as he got here, so we shall have
    to wait a few days.My crocuses and daffodils are budded to blossom,
    and the sweet-scented English violets are in bloom, filling the
    parlors here with fragrance.We
    do not have to wait for it, but before we are aware it is here.I think we shall make you a little visit this
    summer.How are Father and Mother and Constant and yourself?Much
    love to you all from all of us.Affectionately

                ANGELINE HALL.18th ’74

    DEAR SISTER MARY: I am getting very anxious to hear from you.Little
    “A” commenced a letter to you during his vacation, and copied those
    verses you sent so as to send the original back to you.But he did
    not finish his letter and I fear he will not have time to write
    again for some time as his studies take almost every minute he can
    spare from eating and sleeping.Baby grows smart
    and handsome all the time.Angelo keeps fat and rosy though we have to be careful of him.Samie
    is getting taller and taller, and can not find time to play enough.Mother Hall is with us this winter, is helping me about the sewing.You
    must dress warm so as not to take cold.Have you got any body to
    help you this winter?Has Salina gone to the
    music school?Must write to Elmina in a day or
    two.The baby thinks Granpa’s saw-man is the nicest thing he can find.Angelo is so choice of it he will not let him touch it often.Affectionately

                ANGELINE.GEORGETOWN March 22nd [1877 probably]

    DEAR SISTER MARY: We are working on our grounds some as the weather
    permits.It will be very pretty here when we get it done.And our
    house is as convenient as can be now.Tell Mother I have set out a
    rose bush for her, and am going to plant one for Grandma Hall too.Samie has improved a great deal the last year, he is getting stout
    and tall.Angelo is as fat as a pig and as keen as a knife.Percy is
    a real nice little boy, he has learned most of his letters.will go ahead of his Father yet if he keeps his health.I never
    saw a boy of his age study as he does, every thing must be right,
    and be understood before he will go an inch.I am pretty well, but have to be careful, if I get sick a little am
    sure to have a little malarial fever.Much love to you all and write soon telling me how Mother is.Affectionately

                ANGELINE HALL.13th 1881

    DEAR ASAPH, Yesterday we buried Nellie over in the cemetery on
    Grandfather’s old farm in Rodman.You can not think how beautiful
    and grand she looked.She had improved very much since she was at
    our house, and I see she had many friends.I think she was a
    superior girl, but too sensitive and ambitious to live in this world
    so cramped and hedged about.She went down to help Mary, and Mr.Wright’s people came for her to go up and help them as Mrs.Wright
    was sick, so Nellie went up there and washed and worked very hard
    and came back to Mary’s completely exhausted, and I think she had a
    congestive chill to begin with and another when she died.The little boys and I are at Elminas.I came over to rest a little,
    am about used up.One of the neighbors has just come over saying
    that Mary died last night at nine o’clock, and will be buried
    to-morrow.So to-morrow morning I suppose I shall go back over to
    Constant’s, do not know how long I shall stay there.I wish to know how you are getting on at home.With Much Love

                C. A. S. HALL.I do not know whether I had better go home, or try to stay
    here and rest, I am so miserably tired.THE OLD BRICK, GOSHEN
                                     9 A.M.Monday Morning July 14, 1884

    DEAR ASAPH: I have just got through the morning’s work.Got up at
    half past five, built the fire, got the breakfast which consisted of
    cold roast beef, baked potatoes, Graham gems, and raspberries and
    cream.Percie got up with me and went for the berries, Angelo went over to
    his Uncle Lyman’s for the milk and cream, and Samie went out into
    the garden to work.After breakfast
    all the boys went to the garden, Samie and Percie to kill potato
    bugs and Angelo to pick the peas for dinner.Samie has just come in
    to his lessons.Angelo is not quite through, Percie is done.I have
    washed the dishes and done the chamber work.Now I have some mending
    and a little ironing to do.I have done our washing so far a little
    at a time.I washed some Saturday so I have the start of the common
    washer-women and iron Monday.I suppose at home you have got
    somebody to wait on you all round, and then find it hard work to
    live.I have mastered the situation here, though it has been very
    hard for two weeks, and have got things clean and comfortable.The old brick and mortar though, fall down freely whenever one
    raises or shuts a window, or when the wind slams a door, as it often
    does here in this country of wind.It was showery Friday and Saturday afternoon
    and some of his hay got wet.Next month Lyman is to take the superintendency of the Torrington
    creamery much to the discomfiture of Mary.[Professor Hall’s brother
    Lyman married Mary Gilman, daughter of Mrs.He made
    no arrangements as to stated salary.Mary is trying to have that
    fixed and I hope she will.I think he had better come up here and stay with
    us awhile if his health does not improve very soon.Adelaide is staying with Dine during her vacation, they both came up
    here last Tuesday, stayed to dinner, brought little Mary.I have not
    seen Mary Humphrey yet.[Adelaide and Adeline, twins, and Mary
    Humphrey were Professor Hall’s sisters.]But the boys saw her the
    Fourth.Affectionately

                C. A. S. HALL.I do not think best for A. to go to Pulkowa.17th 1887

    MY DEAR BOYS [Samuel and Angelo at college] We received Angelo’s
    letter the first of the week and were very glad to get such a nice
    long letter and learn how strong you were both growing.I left for New Haven two weeks ago this morning; had a pleasant
    journey.I had a room on Wall street not far
    from the College buildings, so it was a long way to the Observatory
    and I did not get up to the Observatory till Sunday afternoon, as A.
    wanted to sleep in the mornings.Friday A. drove me up to East Rock,
    which overlooks the city, the sea and the surrounding country.Elkins and after tea, a
    pleasant little party gathered there.Newton came and
    took me to hear President Dwight preach, in the afternoon A. and I
    went to Mrs.Winchesters to see the beautiful flowers in the green
    houses, then we went to Prof.Marshes, after which we went to Miss
    Twinings to tea then to Prof.Monday I went up to the
    Observatory and mended a little for A. then went to Dr.Leighton’s
    to tea and afterwards to a party at Mrs.I forgot to
    say that Monday morning Mrs.Wright came for me and we went through
    Prof.Wright’s physical Laboratory, then to the top of the Insurance
    building with Prof.Newton to get a view of the city.Tuesday
    morning I went up to the Observatory again and mended a little more
    for A., then went down to dinner and at about half past two left for
    New York where I arrived just before dark, went to the Murray Hill
    Hotel, got up into the hall on the way to my room and there met Dr.Peters, who said that father was around somewhere, after awhile he
    came.Wednesday I went to the meeting of the Academy.Draper gave a
    supper, and before supper Prof.Pickering read a paper on his
    spectroscopic work with the Draper fund, and showed pictures of the

    see Edison’s new phonograph.Saturday morning your father and I went to the museum and saw the
    statuary and paintings there, and left Jersey City about 2 P.M.for
    home, where we arrived at about half past eight: We had a pleasant
    time, but were rather tired.Percie and all are well as usual.Aunt
    Charlotte is a great deal better.Aunt Ruth has not gone to
    Wisconsin.I guess she will
    send some of it to Homer to come home with.Jasper has left home
    again said he was going to Syracuse.Aunt Ruth has trouble enough,
    says she has been over to Elmina’s, and David does not get up till
    breakfast time leaving E. to do all the chores I suppose.She writes
    that Leffert Eastman’s wife is dead, and their neighbor Mr.Now I must close my diary or I shall not get it into the office

    MY DEAR ANGELO AND PERCIVAL [at college],... Sam.is reading
    Goethe’s Faust aloud to me when I can sit down to sew, and perhaps I
    told you that he is helping me to get things together for my
    Prometheus Unbound.He is translating now Aeschylos’ fragments for I
    wish to know as far as possible how Aeschylos treated the subject.I
    have a plan all my own which I think a good one, and have made a
    beginning.I know I shall have to work hard if I write any thing
    good, but am willing to work.On the next day after
    Thanksgiving our Historical Society begins its work.With love

    MY DEAR BOYS [Angelo and Percival], I arrived here safely early this
    afternoon.Miss Waitt and I had a very pleasant drive on Thursday.Stopped at the John Brown place for
    lunch, then drove over to Lake Placid, we went up to the top of the
    tower at Grand View House and had a good look at the mountains and
    the lake as far as we could see it there.Then we passed on to
    Wilmington Notch which I think much finer than any mountain pass
    which I have before seen.We went on to Wilmington and stayed over
    night.There was a hard shower before breakfast, but the rain
    stopped in time for the renewal of our journey.We arrived at Au
    Sable Chasm a little after noon on Saturday.The Chasm is very
    picturesque but not so grand as the Wilmington Pass.We saw the
    falls in the Au Sable near the Pass; there are several other falls
    before the river reaches the Chasm.From the Chasm we went on to
    Port Kent where Miss Waitt took the steamer for Burlington, and
    where I stayed over night.In the morning I took the steamer for
    Ticonderoga.We plunged into a fog which shut out all view till we
    neared Burlington, when it lifted a little.After a while it nearly
    all went away, and I had a farewell look of the mountains as we
    passed.It began to rain before we reached Ticonderoga but we got a
    very good view of the old Fort.I thought of Asaph Hall the first,
    and old Ethan Allen, and of your great great grandfather David Hall
    whose bones lie in an unknown grave somewhere in the vicinity.The steamer goes south only to Ticonderoga; and there I took the
    cars for Whitehall where I found my cousin Elizabeth Benjamin
    seemingly most happy to see me.She is an intelligent woman though
    she has had very little opportunity for book learning.She has a
    fine looking son at Whitehall.It will soon be time for you to leave Keene.I think it would be
    well for you to pack your tent the day before you go if you can
    sleep one night in the large tent.Of course the tent should be dry
    when it is packed if possible, otherwise you will have to dry it
    after you get to Cambridge.Remember to take all the things out of
    my room there.The essence of peppermint set near the west window.They are all well here at the Borsts.I shall go up to Aunt Elmina’s this week.Love to all,

    MY DEAR BOYS [Angelo and Percival at college],... I am sorry the
    Boston girl is getting to be so helpless.I think all who have to
    keep some one to take care of them had better leave for Europe on
    the first steamer.I think co-education would be a great help to both boys and girls.I
    have never liked schools for girls alone since Harriette Lewis and
    Antoinette McLain went to Pittsfield to the Young Ladies Institute.Stanton’s advice to her sons, “When
    you marry do choose a woman with a spine and sound teeth.” Now I
    think a woman needs two kinds of good back-bone.As for Astronomical work, and all kinds of scientific work, there
    may not be the pressing need there was for it a few centuries ago;
    but I think our modern theory of progress is nearly right as
    described by Taine, “as that which founds all our aspirations on the
    boundless advance of the sciences, on the increase of comforts which
    their applied discoveries constantly bring to the human condition,
    and on the increase of good sense which their discoveries,
    popularized, slowly deposit in the human brain.” Of course Ethical
    teaching must keep pace.It is well to keep the teaching of the
    Prometheus Bound in mind, that merely material civilization is not
    enough; and must not stand alone.But the knowledge that we get from
    all science, that effects follow causes always, will teach perhaps
    just as effectively as other preaching.This makes me think of the pleasant time Sam and I had when he was
    home last, reading George Eliot’s Romola.This work is really a
    great drama, and I am much impressed with the power of it.I would say _Philosophy_ AND Science now and forever one and
    inseparable....

            With much love

    MY DEAR PERCIVAL [at college], Your father has just got home from
    Madison.He says you can go to see the boat-race if you wish to.says perhaps he will go, when are the tickets to be sold, he
    says, on the train that follows the race?He thinks perhaps he would
    like two tickets.He
    thought you had better sell to the Fays the bureau, bedstead,
    chairs, etc.and that you send home the revolving bookcase, the desk
    and hair mattress; and such of the bedclothes as you wish to carry
    to the mountains of course you will keep, but I expect to go up
    there and will look over the bedclothes with you, there may be some
    to send home.Now I suppose you are to keep your room so that our friends can see
    the exercises around the tree on Class-day, I wish Mr.Daniel journeyed to the hallway.King
    to come and Mr.Will you write to them or shall I
    write?I expect to go up on Wednesday the 22nd so as to get a little rested
    before Class-day.I intend to go over to stay with Mrs.Berrien at
    North Andover between Class-day and Commencement.We have just received an invitation to Carrie Clark’s wedding.An invitation came from Theodore Smith to Father and me, but father
    says he will not go.With love

                             CHAPTER XVII.––––––
                       AUGUSTA LARNED’S TRIBUTE.The following tribute was written by Miss Augusta Larned, and published
in the _Christian Register_ of July 28, 1892:

    There is one master link in the family bond, as there is one
    keystone in the arch.Often we know not its binding power until it
    is taken away.Then the home begins to crumble and fall into
    confusion, and the distinct atoms, like beads from a broken string,
    roll off into distant corners.We turn our thoughts to one who made
    the ideal home, pervaded it, filled its every part like air and
    sunshine coming in at open windows, as unobtrusive as gentle.A
    spiritual attraction drew all to this centre.It was not what she
    said or did; it was what she was that inclined footsteps to her
    door.Those who once felt that subtle, penetrating sweetness felt
    they must return to bask in it again and again.So she never lost
    friends by a loss more pathetic than death.There were no
    dislocations in her life.The good she did seemed to enter the pores of the spirit, and to
    uplift in unknown ways the poor degraded ideal of our lives.The
    secret of her help was not exuberance, but stillness and rest.Ever
    more and more the beautiful secret eluded analysis.It shone out of
    her eyes.It lingered in the lovely smile that irradiated her face,
    and made every touch and tone a benediction.Even the dullest
    perception must have seen that her life was spiritual, based on
    unselfishness and charity.Beside her thoughtfulness and tender care
    all other kinds of self-abnegation seemed poor.She lived in the
    higher range of being.The purity of her face and the clearness of
    her eyes was a rebuke to all low motives.But no word of criticism
    fell from her lips.She was ready to take into her all-embracing
    tenderness those whom others disliked and shunned.Her gentle nature
    found a thousand excuses for their faults.Life had been hard with
    them; and, for this reason, she must be lenient.The good in each
    soul was always present to her perceptions.She reverenced it even
    in its evil admixture as a manifestation of the divine.She shunned the smallest witticism at another’s expense, lest she
    should pain or soil that pure inner mirror of conscience by an
    exaggeration.To the poor
    and despised she never condescended, but poured out her love and
    charity as the woman of Scripture broke the box of precious ointment
    to anoint the Master’s feet.All human beings received their due
    meed of appreciation at her hands.She disregarded the conventional
    limits a false social order has set up, shunning this one and
    honoring that one, because of externals.She was not afraid of
    losing her place in society by knowing the wrong people.She went
    her way with a strange unworldliness through all the prickly hedges,
    daring to be true to her own nature.She drew no arbitrary lines
    between human beings.The rich
    were not welcome for their riches, nor the poor for their poverty;
    but all were welcome for their humanity.Her door was as the door of a shrine because the fair amenities were
    always found within.Hospitality to her was as sacred as the hearth
    altar to the ancients.If she had not money to give the mendicant,
    she gave that something infinitely better,—the touch of human
    kinship.Many came for the dole she had to bestow, the secret
    charity that was not taken from her superfluity, but from her need.Her lowliness of heart was like that of a little child.How could a
    stranger suspect that she was a deep and profound student?Her
    researches had led her to the largest, most liberal faith in God and
    the soul and the spirit of Christ incarnate in humanity.The study
    of nature, to which she was devoted, showed her no irreconcilable
    break between science and religion.She could follow the boldest
    flights of the speculative spirit or face the last analysis of the
    physicist, while she clung to God and the witness of her own being.She aimed at an all-round culture, that one part of her nature might
    not be dwarfed by over-balance and disproportion.But it was the high thinking that went on with the daily doing of
    common duties that made her life so exceptional.A scholar in the
    higher realms of knowledge, a thinker, a seeker after truth, but,
    above all, the mother, the wife, the bread-giver to the household.It was a great privilege to know this woman who aped not others’
    fashions, who had better and higher laws to govern her life, who
    admitted no low motive in her daily walk, who made about her, as by
    a magician’s wand, a sacred circle, free from all gossip, envy,
    strife, and pettiness, who kept all bonds intact by constancy and
    undimmed affection, and has left a memory so sacred few can find
    words to express what she was to her friends.*       *       *       *       *

    But love and self-forgetfulness and tender service wear out the
    silver cord.It was fretted away silently, without complaint, the
    face growing ever more seraphic, at moments almost transparent with
    the shining of an inner light.One trembled to look on that
    spiritual beauty.Surely, the light of a near heaven was there.Silently, without complaint or murmur, she was preparing for the
    great change.Far-away thoughts lay mirrored in her clear, shining
    eyes.She had seen upon the mount the pattern of another life.Still
    no outward change in duty-doing, in tender care for others.Then one
    day she lay down and fell asleep like a little child on its mother’s
    breast, with the inscrutable smile on her lips.She who had been
    “mothering” everybody all her life long was at last gathered gently
    and painlessly into the Everlasting Arms.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                               EPILOGUE.An amber Adirondack river flows
               Down through the hills to blue Ontario;
               Along its banks the staunch rock-maple grows,
               And fields of wheat beneath the drifted snow.The summer sun, as if to quench his flame,
               Dips in the lake, and sinking disappears.Such was the land from which my mother came
               To college, questioning the future years;
               And through the Northern winter’s bitter gloom,
               Gilding the pane, her lamp of knowledge burned.The bride of Science she; and he the groom
               She wed; and they together loved and learned.And like Orion, hunting down the stars,
               He found and gave to her the moons of Mars.------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Hid in the silver chain there lay
   Three rubies, without flaw or fleck.He drew her close; the moonless skies
     Shed little light; the fire was dead.Soft pity filled her youthful eyes,
     And many tender things she said.Throughout the hot and silent night
     All that he asked of her she gave.And, left alone ere morning light,
     He went serenely to the grave,

   Happy; for even when the rope
     Confined his neck, his thoughts were free,
   And centered round his Secret Hope
     The little life that was to be.When Poppies bloomed again, she bore
     His child who gaily laughed and crowed,
   While round his tiny neck he wore
     The rubies given on the road.For his small sake she wished to wait,
     But vainly to forget she tried,
   And grieving for the Prisoner's fate,
     She broke her gentle heart and died.Song of Taj Mahomed

   Dear is my inlaid sword; across the Border
   It brought me much reward; dear is my Mistress,
   The jewelled treasure of an amorous hour.Dear beyond measure are my dreams and Fancies.These I adore; for these I live and labour,
   Holding them more than sword or jewelled Mistress,
   For this indeed may rust, and that prove faithless,
   But, till my limbs are dust, I have my Fancies.The Garden of Kama:

   Kama the Indian Eros

   The daylight is dying,
   The Flying fox flying,
         Amber and amethyst burn in the sky.See, the sun throws a late,
   Lingering, roseate
         Kiss to the landscape to bid it good-bye.Oh, come, unresisting,
         Lovely, expectant, on tentative feet.Shadow shall cover us,
   Roses bend over us,
         Making a bride chamber, sacred and sweet.We know not life's reason,
   The length of its season,
         Know not if they know, the great Ones above.We none of us sought it,
   And few could support it,
         Were it not gilt with the glamour of love.But much is forgiven
   To Gods who have given,
         If but for an hour, the Rapture of Youth.You do not yet know it,
   But Kama shall show it,
         Changing your dreams to his Exquisite Truth.The Fireflies shall light you,
   And naught shall afright you,
         Nothing shall trouble the Flight of the Hours.Come, for I wait for you,
   Night is too late for you,
         Come, while the twilight is closing the flowers.Every breeze still is,
   And, scented with lilies,
         Cooled by the twilight, refreshed by the dew,
   The garden lies breathless,
   Where Kama, the Deathless,
         In the hushed starlight, is waiting for you.Camp Follower's Song, Gomal River

   We have left Gul Kach behind us,
      Are marching on Apozai,--
   Where pleasure and rest are waiting
      To welcome us by and by.We're falling back from the Gomal,
      Across the Gir-dao plain,
   The camping ground is deserted,
      We'll never come back again.Along the rocks and the defiles,
      The mules and the camels wind.Good-bye to Rahimut-Ullah,
      The man who is left behind.For some we lost in the skirmish,
      And some were killed in the fight,
   But he was captured by fever,
      In the sentry pit, at night.A rifle shot had been swifter,
      Less trouble a sabre thrust,
   But his Fate decided fever,
      And each man dies as he must.The wavering flames rise high,
   The flames of our burning grass-huts,
      Against the black of the sky.We hear the sound of the river,
      An ever-lessening moan,
   The hearts of us all turn backwards
      To where he is left alone.We sing up a little louder,
      We know that we feel bereft,
   We're leaving the camp together,
      And only one of us left.The only one, out of many,
      And each must come to his end,
   I wish I could stop this singing,
      He happened to be my friend.We're falling back from the Gomal
      We're marching on Apozai,
   And pleasure and rest are waiting
      To welcome us by and by.Perhaps the feast will taste bitter,
      The lips of the girls less kind,--
   Because of Rahimut-Ullah,
      The man who is left behind!Song of the Colours: by Taj Mahomed

   _Rose-colour_
   Rose Pink am I, the colour gleams and glows
     In many a flower; her lips, those tender doors
   By which, in time of love, love's essence flows
     From him to her, are dyed in delicate Rose.Mine is the earliest Ruby light that pours
     Out of the East, when day's white gates unclose.On downy peach, and maiden's downier cheek
     I, in a flush of radiant bloom, alight,
   Clinging, at sunset, to the shimmering peak
     I veil its snow in floods of Roseate light._Azure_
   Mine is the heavenly hue of Azure skies,
     Where the white clouds lie soft as seraphs' wings,
   Mine the sweet, shadowed light in innocent eyes,
     Whose lovely looks light only on lovely things.Mine the Blue Distance, delicate and clear,
     Mine the Blue Glory of the morning sea,
   All that the soul so longs for, finds not here,
     Fond eyes deceive themselves, and find in me.to the Royal Red of living Blood,
     Let loose by steel in spirit-freeing flood,
   Forced from faint forms, by toil or torture torn
     Staining the patient gates of life new born.Colour of War and Rage, of Pomp and Show,
     Banners that flash, red flags that flaunt and glow,
   Colour of Carnage, Glory, also Shame,
     Raiment of women women may not name.I hide in mines, where unborn Rubies dwell,
     Flicker and flare in fitful fire in Hell,
   The outpressed life-blood of the grape is mine,
     Hail!Strong am I, over strong, to eyes that tire,
     In the hot hue of Rapine, Riot, Flame.Death and Despair are black, War and Desire,
     The two red cards in Life's unequal game._Green_
   I am the Life of Forests, and Wandering Streams,
     Green as the feathery reeds the Florican love,
   Young as a maiden, who of her marriage dreams,
     Still sweetly inexperienced in ways of Love.Colour of Youth and Hope, some waves are mine,
     Some emerald reaches of the evening sky.See, in the Spring, my sweet green Promise shine,
     Never to be fulfilled, of by and by.Never to be fulfilled; leaves bud, and ever
     Something is wanting, something falls behind;
   The flowered Solstice comes indeed, but never
     That light and lovely summer men divined._Violet_
   I were the colour of Things, (if hue they had)
         That are hard to name.Of curious, twisted thoughts that men call "mad"
         Or oftener "shame."Of that delicate vice, that is hardly vice,
         So reticent, rare,
   Ethereal, as the scent of buds and spice,
         In this Eastern air.On palm-fringed shores I colour the Cowrie shell,
         With its edges curled;
   And, deep in Datura poison buds, I dwell
         In a perfumed world.My lilac tinges the edge of the evening sky
         Where the sunset clings.My purple lends an Imperial Majesty
         To the robes of kings._Yellow_
   Gold am I, and for me, ever men curse and pray,
     Selling their souls and each other, by night and day.A sordid colour, and yet, I make some things fair,
     Dying sunsets, fields of corn, and a maiden's hair.Thus they discoursed in the daytime,--Violet, Yellow, and Blue,
     Emerald, Scarlet, and Rose-colour, the pink and perfect hue.Thus they spoke in the sunshine, when their beauty was manifest,
     Till the Night came, and the Silence, and gave them an equal rest.Lalila, to the Ferengi Lover

   Why above others was I so blessed
      And honoured?to be chosen one
   To hold you, sleeping, against my breast,
      As now I may hold your only son.You gave your life to me in a kiss;
   Have I done well, for that past delight,
      In return, to have given you this?Look down at his face, your face, beloved,
      His eyes are azure as yours are blue.In every line of his form is proved
      How well I loved you, and only you.I felt the secret hope at my heart
      Turned suddenly to the living joy,
   And knew that your life and mine had part
      As golden grains in a brass alloy.And learning thus, that your child was mine,
      Thrilled by the sense of its stirring life,
   I held myself as a sacred shrine
      Afar from pleasure, and pain, and strife,

   That all unworthy I might not be
      Of that you had deigned to cause to dwell
   Hidden away in the heart of me,
      As white pearls hide in a dusky shell.Do you remember, when first you laid
      Your lips on mine, that enchanted night?My eyes were timid, my lips afraid,
      You seemed so slender and strangely white.I always tremble; the moments flew
      Swiftly to dawn that took you away,
   But this is a small and lovely you
      Content to rest in my arms all day.Oh, since you have sought me, Lord, for this,
      And given your only child to me,
   My life devoted to yours and his,
      Whilst I am living, will always be.And after death, through the long To Be,
      (Which, I think, must surely keep love's laws,)
   I, should you chance to have need of me,
      Am ever and always, only yours.On the City Wall

   Upon the City Ramparts, lit up by sunset gleam,
   The Blue eyes that conquer, meet the Darker eyes that dream.The Dark eyes, so Eastern, and the Blue eyes from the West,
   The last alight with action, the first so full of rest.Brown, that seem to hold the Past; its magic mystery,
   Blue, that catch the early light, of ages yet to be.Meet and fall and meet again, then linger, look, and smile,
   Time and distance all forgotten, for a little while.Happy on the city wall, in the warm spring weather,
   All the force of Nature's laws, drawing them together.East and West so gaily blending, for a little space,
   All the sunshine seems to centre, round th' Enchanted place!One rides down the dusty road, one watches from the wall,
   Azure eyes would fain return, and Amber eyes recall;

   Would fain be on the ramparts, and resting heart to heart,
   But time o' love is overpast, East and West must part.Those are dim, and ride away, these cry themselves to sleep._"Oh, since Love is all so short, the sob so near the smile,_
   _Blue eyes that always conquer us, is it worth your while?"_





"Love Lightly"

   There were Roses in the hedges, and Sunshine in the sky,
   Red Lilies in the sedges, where the water rippled by,
   A thousand Bulbuls singing, oh, how jubilant they were,
   And a thousand flowers flinging their sweetness on the air.But you, who sat beside me, had a shadow in your eyes,
   Their sadness seemed to chide me, when I gave you scant replies;
   You asked "Did I remember?"In vain you fanned the ember, for the love flame was not there."And so, since you are tired of me, you ask me to forget,
     What is the use of caring, now that you no longer care?When Love is dead his Memory can only bring regret,
     But how can I forget you with the flowers in your hair?"What use the scented Roses, or the azure of the sky?They are sweet when Love reposes, but then he had to die.What could I do in leaving you, but ask you to forget,--
   I suffered, too, in grieving you; I all but loved you yet.But half love is a treason, that no lover can forgive,
   I had loved you for a season, I had no more to give.You saw my passion faltered, for I could but let you see,
   And it was not I that altered, but Fate that altered me.And so, since I am tired of love, I ask you to forget,
     What is the use you caring, now that I no longer care?When Love is dead, his Memory can only bring regret;
     Forget me, oh, forget me, and my flower-scented hair!No Rival Like the Past

   As those who eat a Luscious Fruit, sunbaked,
     Full of sweet juice, with zest, until they find
   It finished, and their appetite unslaked,
     And so return and eat the pared-off rind;--

   We, who in Youth, set white and careless teeth
     In the Ripe Fruits of Pleasure while they last,
   Later, creep back to gnaw the cast-off sheath,
     And find there is no Rival like the Past.Verse by Taj Mahomed

   When first I loved, I gave my very soul
   Utterly unreserved to Love's control,
   But Love deceived me, wrenched my youth away
   And made the gold of life for ever grey.Long I lived lonely, yet I tried in vain
   With any other Joy to stifle pain;
   There _is_ no other joy, I learned to know,
   And so returned to Love, as long ago.Yet I, this little while ere I go hence,
   Love very lightly now, in self-defence.Lines by Taj Mahomed

   This passion is but an ember
     Of a Sun, of a Fire, long set;
   I could not live and remember,
     And so I love and forget.You say, and the tone is fretful,
     That my mourning days were few,
   You call me over forgetful--
     My God, if you only knew!There is no Breeze to Cool the Heat of Love

   The listless Palm-trees catch the breeze above
     The pile-built huts that edge the salt Lagoon,
   There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love,
     No wind from land or sea, at night or noon.Perfumed and robed I wait, my Lord, for you,
     And my heart waits alert, with strained delight,
   My flowers are loath to close, as though they knew
     That you will come to me before the night.In the Verandah all the lights are lit,
     And softly veiled in rose to please your eyes,
   Between the pillars flying foxes flit,
     Their wings transparent on the lilac skies.Come soon, my Lord, come soon, I almost fear
     My heart may fail me in this keen suspense,
   Break with delight, at last, to know you near.Pleasure is one with Pain, if too intense.I envy these: the steps that you will tread,
     The jasmin that will touch you by its leaves,
   When, in your slender height, you stoop your head
     At the low door beneath the palm-thatched eaves.For though you utterly belong to me,
     And love has done his utmost 'twixt us twain,
   Your slightest, careless touch yet seems to be
     That keen delight so much akin to pain.The night breeze blows across the still Lagoon,
     And stirs the Palm-trees till they wave above
   Our pile-built huts; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon,
     There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love.Every time you give yourself to me,
     The gift seems greater, and yourself more fair,
   This slight-built, palm-thatched hut has come to be
     A temple, since, my Lord, you visit there.And as the water, gurgling softly, goes
     Among the piles beneath the slender floor;
   I hear it murmur, as it seaward flows,
     Of the great Wonder seen upon the shore.The Miracle, that you should come to me,
     Whom the whole world, seeing, can but desire,
   It is as though some White Star stooped to be
     The messmate of our little cooking fire.Leaving the Glory of his Purple Skies,
     And the White Friendship of the Crescent Moon,
   And yet;--I look into your brilliant eyes,
     And find content; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon.Perfumed and robed I wait for you, I wait,
     The flowers that please you wreathed about my hair,
   And this poor face set forth in jewelled state,
     So more than proud since you have found it fair.My lute is ready, and the fragrant drink
     Your lips may honour, how it will rejoice
   Losing its life in yours!the lute I think
     But wastes the time when I might hear your voice.Your slightest, as your utmost, wish or will,
   Whether it please you to caress or slay,
     It would please me to give obedience still.I would delight to die beneath your kiss;
     I envy that young maiden who was slain,
   So her warm blood, flowing beneath the kiss,
     Might ease the wounded Sultan of his pain--

   If she loved him as I love you, my Lord.There is no pleasure on the earth so sweet
   As is the pain endured for one adored;
     If I lay crushed beneath your slender feet

   I should be happy!Ah, come soon, come soon,
     See how the stars grow large and white above,
   The land breeze blows across the salt Lagoon,
     There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love.Malay Song

   The Stars await, serene and white,
     The unarisen moon;
   Oh, come and stay with me to-night,
     Beside the salt Lagoon!My hut is small, but as you lie,
     You see the lighted shore,
   And hear the rippling water sigh
     Beneath the pile-raised floor.No gift have I of jewels or flowers,
     My room is poor and bare:
   But all the silver sea is ours,
     And all the scented air

   Blown from the mainland, where there grows
     Th' "Intriguer of the Night,"
   The flower that you have named Tube rose,
     Sweet scented, slim, and white.The flower that, when the air is still
     And no land breezes blow,
   From its pale petals can distil
     A phosphorescent glow.I see your ship at anchor ride;
     Her "captive lightning" shine.Before she takes to-morrow's tide,
     Let this one night be mine!Though in the language of your land
     My words are poor and few,
   Oh, read my eyes, and understand,
     I give my youth to you!The Temple Dancing Girl

   You will be mine; those lightly dancing feet,
     Falling as softly on the careless street
   As the wind-loosened petals of a flower,
     Will bring you here, at the Appointed Hour.And all the Temple's little links and laws
     Will not for long protect your loveliness.I have a stronger force to aid my cause,
     Nature's great Law, to love and to possess!Throughout those sleepless watches, when I lay
     Wakeful, desiring what I might not see,
   I knew (it helped those hours, from dusk to day),
     In this one thing, Fate would be kind to me.You will consent, through all my veins like wine
     This prescience flows; your lips meet mine above,
   Your clear soft eyes look upward into mine
     Dim in a silent ecstasy of love.The clustered softness of your waving hair,
     That curious paleness which enchants me so,
   And all your delicate strength and youthful air,
     Destiny will compel you to bestow!Refuse, withdraw, and hesitate awhile,
     Your young reluctance does but fan the flame;
   My partner, Love, waits, with a tender smile,
     Who play against him play a losing game.I, strong in nothing else, have strength in this,
     The subtlest, most resistless, force we know
   Is aiding me; and you must stoop and kiss:
     The genius of the race will have it so!Yet, make it not too long, nor too intense
     My thirst; lest I should break beneath the strain,
   And the worn nerves, and over-wearied sense,
     Enjoy not what they spent themselves to gain.Lest, in the hour when you consent to share
     That human passion Beauty makes divine,
   I, over worn, should find you over fair,
     Lest I should die before I make you mine.You will consent, those slim, reluctant feet,
     Falling as lightly on the careless street
   As the white petals of a wind-worn flower,
     Will bring you here, at the Appointed Hour.Hira-Singh's Farewell to Burmah

   On the wooden deck of the wooden Junk, silent, alone, we lie,
   With silver foam about the bow, and a silver moon in the sky:
   A glimmer of dimmer silver here, from the anklets round your feet,
   Our lips may close on each other's lips, but never our souls may meet.For though in my arms you lie at rest, your name I have never heard,
   To carry a thought between us two, we have not a single word.And yet what matter we do not speak, when the ardent eyes have spoken,
   The way of love is a sweeter way, when the silence is unbroken.As a wayward Fancy, tired at times, of the cultured Damask Rose,
   Drifts away to the tangled copse, where the wild Anemone grows;
   So the ordered and licit love ashore, is hardly fresh and free
   As this light love in the open wind and salt of the outer sea.So sweet you are, with your tinted cheeks and your small caressive hands,
   What if I carried you home with me, where our Golden Temple stands?Yet, this were folly indeed; to bind, in fetters of permanence,
   A passing dream whose enchantment charms because of its trancience.Life is ever a slave to Time; we have but an hour to rest,
   Her steam is up and her lighters leave, the vessel that takes me west;
   And never again we two shall meet, as we chance to meet to-night,
   On the Junk, whose painted eyes gaze forth, in desolate want of sight.And what is love at its best, but this?Conceived by a passing glance,
   Nursed and reared in a transient mood, on a drifting Sea of Chance.For rudderless craft are all our loves, among the rocks and the shoals,
   Well we may know one another's speech, but never each other's souls.Give here your lips and kiss me again, we have but a moment more,
   Before we set the sail to the mast, before we loosen the oar.Good-bye to you, and my thanks to you, for the rest you let me share,
   While this night drifted away to the Past, to join the Nights that Were.Starlight

   O beautiful Stars, when you see me go
     Hither and thither, in search of love,
   Do you think me faithless, who gleam and glow
     Serene and fixed in the blue above?O Stars, so golden, it is not so.But there is a garden I dare not see,
     There is a place where I fear to go,
   Since the charm and glory of life to me
     The brown earth covered there, long ago.O Stars, you saw it, you know, you know.Hither and thither I wandering go,
     With aimless haste and wearying fret;
   In a search for pleasure and love?Not so,
     Seeking desperately to forget.You see so many, O Stars, you know.Sampan Song

   A little breeze blew over the sea,
       And it came from far away,
   Across the fields of millet and rice,
   All warm with sunshine and sweet with spice,
   It lifted his curls and kissed him thrice,
       As upon the deck he lay.It said, "Oh, idle upon the sea,
       Awake and with sleep have done,
   Haul up the widest sail of the prow,
   And come with me to the rice fields now,
   She longs, oh, how can I tell you how,
       To show you your first-born son!"Song of the Devoted Slave

   There is one God: Mahomed his Prophet.Had I his power
   I would take the topmost peaks of the snow-clad Himalayas,
   And would range them around your dwelling, during the heats of summer,
   To cool the airs that fan your serene and delicate presence,
                   Had I the power.Your courtyard should ever be filled with the fleetest of camels
   Laden with inlaid armour, jewels and trappings for horses,
   Ripe dates from Egypt, and spices and musk from Arabia.And the sacred waters of Zem-Zem well, transported thither,
   Should bubble and flow in your chamber, to bathe the delicate
   Slender and wayworn feet of my Lord, returning from travel,
                   Had I the power.Fine woven silk, from the further East, should conceal your beauty,
   Clinging around you in amorous folds; caressive, silken,
   Beautiful long-lashed, sweet-voiced Persian boys should, kneeling, serve you,
   And the floor beneath your sandalled feet should be smooth and golden,
                   Had I the power.And if ever your clear and stately thoughts should turn to women,
   Kings' daughters, maidens, should be appointed to your caresses,
   That the youth and the strength of my Lord might never be wasted
   In light or sterile love; but enrich the world with his children.Whilst I should sit in the outer court of the Water Palace
   To await the time when you went forth, for Pleasure or Warfare,
   Descending the stairs rose crowned, or armed and arrayed in purple,--
   To mark the place where your steps have fallen, and kiss the footprints,
                   Had I the power.The Singer

   The singer only sang the Joy of Life,
     For all too well, alas!the singer knew
   How hard the daily toil, how keen the strife,
     How salt the falling tear; the joys how few.He who thinks hard soon finds it hard to live,
     Learning the Secret Bitterness of Things:
   So, leaving thought, the singer strove to give
     A level lightness to his lyric strings.He only sang of Love; its joy and pain,
     But each man in his early season loves;
   Each finds the old, lost Paradise again,
     Unfolding leaves, and roses, nesting doves.And though that sunlit time flies all too fleetly,
     Delightful Days that dance away too soon!Its early morning freshness lingers sweetly
     Throughout life's grey and tedious afternoon.And he, whose dreams enshrine her tender eyes,
     And she, whose senses wait his waking hand,
   Impatient youth, that tired but sleepless lies,
     Will read perhaps, and reading, understand.Oh, roseate lips he would have loved to kiss,
     Oh, eager lovers that he never knew!What should you know of him, or words of his?--
     But all the songs he sang were sung for you!Malaria

   He lurks among the reeds, beside the marsh,
     Red oleanders twisted in His hair,
   His eyes are haggard and His lips are harsh,
     Upon His breast the bones show gaunt and bare.The green and stagnant waters lick His feet,
     And from their filmy, iridescent scum
   Clouds of mosquitoes, gauzy in the heat,
     Rise with His gifts: Death and Delirium.His messengers: They bear the deadly taint
     On spangled wings aloft and far away,
   Making thin music, strident and yet faint,
     From golden eve to silver break of day.The baffled sleeper hears th' incessant whine
     Through his tormented dreams, and finds no rest
   The thirsty insects use his blood for wine,
     Probe his blue veins and pasture on his breast.While far away He in the marshes lies,
     Staining the stagnant water with His breath,
   An endless hunger burning in His eyes,
     A famine unassuaged, whose food is Death.He hides among the ghostly mists that float
     Over the water, weird and white and chill,
   And peasants, passing in their laden boat,
     Shiver and feel a sense of coming ill.A thousand burn and die; He takes no heed,
     Their bones, unburied, strewn upon the plain,
   Only increase the frenzy of His greed
     To add more victims to th' already slain.He loves the haggard frame, the shattered mind,
     Gloats with delight upon the glazing eye,
   Yet, in one thing, His cruelty is kind,
     He sends them lovely dreams before they die;

   Dreams that bestow on them their heart's desire,
     Visions that find them mad, and leave them blest,
   To sink, forgetful of the fever's fire,
     Softly, as in a lover's arms, to rest.Fancy

   Far in the Further East the skilful craftsman
       Fashioned this fancy for the West's delight.This rose and azure Dragon, crouching softly
       Upon the satin skin, close-grained and white.And you lay silent, while his slender needles
       Pricked the intricate pattern on your arm,
   Combining deftly Cruelty and Beauty,
       That subtle union, whose child is charm.Charm irresistible: the lovely something
       We follow in our dreams, but may not reach.The unattainable Divine Enchantment,
       Hinted in music, never heard in speech.This from the blue design exhales towards me,
       As incense rises from the Homes of Prayer,
   While the unfettered eyes, allured and rested,
       Urge the forbidden lips to stoop and share;

   Share in the sweetness of the rose and azure
       Traced in the Dragon's form upon the white
   Curve of the arm.Ah, curb thyself, my fancy,
       Where would'st thou drift in this enchanted flight?Feroza

   The evening sky was as green as Jade,
      As Emerald turf by Lotus lake,
   Behind the Kafila far she strayed,
      (The Pearls are lost if the Necklace break!)A lingering freshness touched the air
      From palm-trees, clustered around a Spring,
   The great, grim Desert lay vast and bare,
      But Youth is ever a careless thing.The Raiders threw her upon the sand,
      Men of the Wilderness know no laws,
   They tore the Amethysts off her hand,
      And rent the folds of her veiling gauze.They struck the lips that they might have kissed,
      Pitiless they to her pain and fear,
   And wrenched the gold from her broken wrist,
      No use to cry; there were none to hear.Her scarlet mouth and her onyx eyes,
      Her braided hair in its silken sheen,
   Were surely meet for a Lover's prize,
      But Fate dissented, and stepped between.Across the Zenith the vultures fly,
      Cruel of beak and heavy of wing.This Month the Almonds Bloom at Kandahar

   I hate this City, seated on the Plain,
     The clang and clamour of the hot Bazar,
   Knowing, amid the pauses of my pain,
     This month the Almonds bloom in Kandahar.The Almond-trees, that sheltered my Delight,
     Screening my happiness as evening fell.It was well worth--that most Enchanted Night--
     This life in torment, and the next in Hell!People are kind to me; one More than Kind,
     Her lashes lie like fans upon her cheek,
   But kindness is a burden on my mind,
     And it is weariness to hear her speak.For though that Kaffir's bullet holds me here,
     My thoughts are ever free, and wander far,
   To where the Lilac Hills rise, soft and clear,
     Beyond the Almond Groves of Kandahar.He followed me to Sibi, to the Fair,
     The Horse-fair, where he shot me weeks ago,
   But since they fettered him I have no care
     That my returning steps to health are slow.They will not loose him till they know my fate,
     And I rest here till I am strong to slay,
   Meantime, my Heart's Delight may safely wait
     Among the Almond blossoms, sweet as they.Well, he won by day,
     But I won, what I so desired, by night,
   _My_ arms held what his lack till Judgment Day!Also, the game is not yet over--quite!Wait, Amir Ali, wait till I come forth
     To kill, before the Almond-trees are green,
   To raze thy very Memory from the North,
     _So that thou art not, and thou hast not been!_

   Aha!it is Duty
     To rid the World from Shiah dogs like thee,
   They are but ill-placed moles on Islam's beauty,
     Such as the Faithful cannot calmly see!Also thy bullet hurts me not a little,
     Thy Shiah blood might serve to salve the ill.Maybe some Afghan Promises are brittle;
     Never a Promise to oneself, to kill!Now I grow stronger, I have days of leisure
     To shape my coming Vengeance as I lie,
   And, undisturbed by call of War or Pleasure,
     Can dream of many ways a man may die.I shall not torture thee, thy friends might rally,
     Some Fate assist thee and prove false to me;
   Oh!shouldst thou now escape me, Amir Ali,
     This would torment me through Eternity!Aye, Shuffa-Jan, I will be quiet indeed,
     Give here the Hakim's powder if thou wilt,
   And thou mayst sit, for I perceive thy need,
     And rest thy soft-haired head upon my quilt.Thy gentle love will not disturb a mind
     That loves and hates beneath a fiercer Star.Also, thou know'st, my Heart is left behind,
     Among the Almond-trees of Kandahar!End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of India's Love Lyrics, by 
Adela Florence Cory Nicolson (AKA Laurence Hope), et al.This may be credible in view of the
fact that absence of pain in puerperal peritonitis is not very
uncommon.The green vomit, which was expected in all cases forty years
ago, for the most part, as I have intimated, disappears under the opium
treatment.There are persons in whom peritonitis does not accelerate
the pulse beyond 100 beats in the minute.The pain, in rare cases,
remits and recurs with some degree of regularity, in this respect
resembling intestinal colic.Andral reports such a case; I have also
witnessed it.MORTALITY.--Up to the time when the opium treatment was adopted,
peritonitis was a fearful word; a large proportion of those attacked by
it died of it.In 1832, I began to visit hospitals as a medical
student, and for eight years, at home or abroad, was almost a daily
attendant.The number of recoveries of those that I saw in that time
can be counted on the fingers of one hand.This may be regarded as its
natural mortality, for the treatment of that day seemed to exercise
little or no control over it.(Farther on this matter will be referred
to again.)DURATION.--Chomel believed that the disease might prove fatal in
eighteen hours, while he regards its average duration as seven or eight
days.I very much doubt whether peritonitis, not caused by perforation,
violence, or surgical operation, was ever fatal in eighteen hours.I do
not remember any case of shorter duration than two or three days.Then,
on the other hand, the period of seven or eight days in the fatal cases
appears to me too long.In the early part of my professional life I
remember to have looked for death in three or four days.At present, in
the fatal cases, life is prolonged to double or more than double that
time.In the majority of those that recover at present the duration of
the symptoms is from two days to a week; in a few they have continued
fourteen days; and lately I have assisted in the treatment of a case in
which there was little amelioration for forty days, and yet the
peritonitis was cured.DIAGNOSIS.--When the symptoms are fully developed there are few
diseases that are more easily recognized.It is when these symptoms are
slowly or irregularly manifested, or when some other disease which may
account for many of the symptoms occurs with it or precedes it, that
there {1144} should be any real difficulty.It is customary to regard
the danger of confounding the transit of a renal or hepatic calculus
with peritonitis as worthy of comment.But if the reader will turn to
the articles in this work which relate to these topics, he will find
the symptoms so widely different from those enumerated in this article
as belonging to peritonitis that he will be surprised that this item in
the diagnosis should have occupied so much room.In a case already referred to, in which peritonitis followed gall-stone
pains, the transition was so marked by the rapid acceleration of the
pulse and swelling of the abdomen that each of the three physicians in
attendance at once appreciated the significance of the change.A
physician who resided in the country called on me to report his own
case.He had a little before had a very painful affection of the
abdomen which continued for three days.The pain was paroxysmal,
confined to the region of the liver, back and front, for one day; after
that there was some tenderness over most of the abdomen, but no
tympanitis.His pulse became frequent and his temperature advanced to
103 degrees.His physicians believed that these symptoms justified them
in treating him for peritonitis.Yet his position in bed was constantly
changed, and no one attitude long continued--a restlessness which never
occurs in peritonitis, but is common in calculus transits.Add to this
the absence of gaseous distension and of the green vomit, the
paroxysmal character of the pain (though I remember one case in which
peritoneal pain increased and diminished somewhat regularly, but only
one), and, finally, the sudden cessation of the pain, such as often
happens in calculus transit when the calculus passes into the
intestine,--it is plain that his sufferings were caused by a
gall-stone.The elevation of temperature was the result of a
long-continued worry of the nervous system, and the abdominal
tenderness came from the many times repeated contraction of the
abdominal muscles which occurs in hepatic colic.And then, to make the
diagnosis more complete, this gentleman, after twelve or fourteen hours
of pain, became jaundiced--in the end very much so.There was no
absolute constipation, and the stools were of the color of clay from
the absence of bile.The points of difference between renal colic and peritonitis are even
better defined and easier recognized than those between it and hepatic
colic.In intestinal colic there may be some inflation of the bowels, and if
it continues a day or two there may be some tenderness; but it is for
the most part distinguished from peritonitis by the intermittent or
remittent character of the pain, by its greater severity while it
lasts, by its courting, rather than repulsing, pressure, by the
moderate acceleration of the pulse, by no or only slight elevation of
temperature (exception being made for long continuance), by the absence
of the green vomit, by the absence of the fixed position of
peritonitis, etc.There does not seem to me any need of spending time to distinguish
gastritis or enteritis or neuralgia from peritonitis, their symptoms
are so wholly different; and if, as is said, the mucous inflammation
can penetrate all the coats of the stomach or intestine, and so cause
inflammation of the peritoneal layer, that is peritonitis, and will be
distinguished by the proper symptoms of peritonitis.TREATMENT.--Chomel[4] says: "If general peritonitis is intense, it
{1145} should be attacked by the most powerful therapeutic agents.One
should immediately prescribe a large bleeding from the arm--from 500 to
600 grammes, for example--and repeat according to the need once or even
twice in the first twenty-four hours; apply to the abdomen, and
particularly to the part of it where the pain was first felt, leeches
in large number--fifty, even a hundred--as the violence of the disease
may demand and the strength of the patient will permit."He recommends
baths, presumably tepid, and describes an apparatus by which the
patient can be put into the bath and lifted out of it without pain;
prescribes a fixed posture, gentle laxatives, mercurial frictions,
blisters; conditionally and doubtfully, paracentesis, emetics under
certain circumstances--musk, etc.In the treatment of
general peritonitis there is no reference to opium.The word does not
occur, but it does in the treatment of peritonitis following
perforation.In this condition he would, among other things, give opium
a haute dose, but he does not prescribe any repetition or give any
details.It is probable that the idea was obtained from Graves, whose
first use of opium in this accident was in 1821, although its first
publication appears to have been by Stokes in 1832.[Footnote 4: _Dictionnaire de Medecine_, 1841.]Wardell,[5] who has written the latest treatise on the disease we are
considering, relies greatly on bloodletting, but falls short of Chomel
in the quantity of blood he would take--would bleed, not to withdraw a
certain number of ounces, but to produce certain effects.The
venesection is to be followed by the application of leeches--twenty,
thirty, or forty--to the abdomen; after this turpentine applications to
the bowels.After depletion, he says, opium should be given at once:
"two or three grains may be given in urgent cases."Vesication he calls
"another of our aids."He disapproves of cathartics, but when there is
accumulation in the colon would use injections."Opium in the asthenic
form is the chief agent, and Graves and Stokes were among the first
physicians who gave it very largely.""Two or three grains may at first
be prescribed, and a grain every four or three, or even two, hours
afterward.""In perforation there is sometimes great toleration of the
drug.Murchison has known so large a quantity as sixty grains to be
given in three days with impunity."Mercurials, he thinks, are of
doubtful efficacy.In the paragraph devoted to the treatment of
puerperal peritonitis the word opium does not occur, and it is only by
a very doubtful inference that we can assume that he would ever use it.Chomel makes no allusion to the use of opium in the same disease.[Footnote 5: _Reynolds's System of Medicine_.]For two years (1834-36) I was connected with the New York Hospital as
house-physician or in positions by which that office is reached.The
treatment of acute diffuse peritonitis then and there was formulated as
follows: First, a full bleeding from the arm, commonly sixteen ounces,
then a dozen or more leeches to the abdomen; following this, another
bleeding or not, in the discretion of the physician.Meantime, the
patient would take half a grain to a grain of calomel every two hours,
with a little opium "to prevent the calomel acting on the bowels," of
which there was no danger, in truth.Mercurial inunction was used at
the same time.The belief was that after depletion the most important
thing was "to establish mercurial action in the system;" in other
words, {1146} "to diminish the plasticity of the blood."Under this
plan I saw one recovery in these two years.In 1840, I went to Vermont to give a course of lectures in the Vermont
Medical College, and while there was called by the physicians to see
with them several cases of peritonitis.I found that they were treating
the disease on the Armstrong plan; that is, bleeding freely, and then
administering a full dose of opium, as they said, "to prolong the
effects of the bleeding."In most cases there was a second bleeding and
a second administration of opium.Leeches were also used, and
irritating applications to the abdomen, and in some cases purges.I
found they were getting better results than we were in New York, and I
studied their cases as closely as I could, and reached the conclusion
that opium was the curative agent, and that it would be safe to omit
the abstraction of blood.This conviction grew in strength with every
new case, and I saw, with different physicians, several cases, the
disease being more prevalent among the mountains there than in the
city--at least that year.The idea then formed was that to establish
the narcotic effects of opium within safe limits, and continue them by
repeated administration of the drug, would cure uncomplicated
peritonitis--that a kind of saturation of the system with opium would
be inconsistent with the progress of the inflammation, and would subdue
it.There was no theory to build the treatment on, and no explanation
of the action of the drug in my mind.What I saw of the action of two
full doses of opium was the only foundation for the idea.I had in the
course of two years after those observations in Vermont 9 cases of
general acute peritonitis, 8 of which were cured.All these were
reported in succession, as they occurred, to the medical societies and
in my college lectures.The plan was adopted by many members of these
societies and by others with whom I had opportunity of conversing on
the subject, so that soon there were several--I may say many--workers
in the field; and in all instances where the practitioner had the
courage to carry out the treatment favorable reports were returned.Not
that every case of peritonitis was cured, but the recoveries generally
exceeded those that followed any other plan ever before used.No
physician tried it with a proper understanding of its details, and with
courage to execute them, who if living does not practise it to-day.The treatment of puerperal peritonitis is not allotted to me, and I am
very reluctent to encroach in any degree on the province of the very
competent and highly-esteemed gentleman to whom that disease was
assigned.But the history of the opium treatment is very incomplete
without the statement I am about to make, and I trust to his generosity
to forgive this encroachment; and all the more confidently because he
was not at the time acquainted with the manner in which opium was first
introduced into the treatment of puerperal fever.After the curative action of the drug was demonstrated in general
peritonitis, I was anxious to try it in puerperal fever, of which
peritonitis forms a part.But I had no hospital and no obstetrical
practice.In 1847, I was appointed one of the physicians to Bellevue
Hospital, to which an obstetrical department was attached.After one or
two years a single case occurred and was sent to my division.I gave
her 100 grains of opium in four days, with more or less of calomel--I
have {1147} forgotten how much.She recovered, but after the symptoms
of puerperal fever passed away she had secondary abscesses of the
lungs.In 1840 there was a very fatal visitation of puerperal fever in this
hospital, and on invitation of Vache, who then had charge of the whole
institution, I was a daily visitor and took notes of all the cases.It
was from these notes that Vache compiled his report of the epidemic
published in the _Medical and Surgical Journal_.The disease was
fearfully fatal, although every known mode of treatment was tried in
different cases, including Brenan's plan by turpentine, but all, with
one or two exceptions, with the same result.At this time the opium
plan was on its trial, and I had not acquired a confidence in it that
authorized me to try it in these cases.One woman was sent to me in
whom the disease was well advanced.I instructed my house-physician not
how much opium to give, but what effects to produce by it.I found this
woman dying the next day, and that she had taken only three grains of
opium in three doses.In three or four days seven cases were sent me
from the lying-in wards.One was returned for error in diagnosis, and
six put under treatment.Having found that prudence in my
house-physician was so much more conspicuous than courage, another
house-officer, who combined them both, was selected to be in almost
constant attendance.The instruction I gave him was in these words: "I
want you to narcotize those women to within an inch of their lives."He
did it, and saved every one of them.This gentleman is now known over
the whole land as a learned and distinguished surgeon.I feel called
upon to give his name in this connection, that he may be a witness to
the facts I state, and for the admiration with which his nerve and
prudence impressed me.One of these patients took first two grains,
then three grains, then four, and so on till she took twelve grains of
opium at a dose, the intervals being two hours.The state into which
the patient was to be brought I have denominated a state of
semi-narcotism.The quantity of the drug necessary to produce this
state varied surprisingly in different persons.One of these women was
pretty fully narcotized by four grains every two hours.She was watched
with anxiety; restoratives were kept in readiness, but nothing was done
but to suspend the administration of the medicine and to wait.In seven
hours the consciousness was fully restored, and the improvement in her
condition was wonderful.But in a few
hours more the symptoms recurred, and the same medicine was again given
in three-grain doses, and again narcotism was produced.Taught by the
experience of the day before, we waited, and when she recovered from
this second narcotism her disease was completely cured.She took no
more medicine of any sort.This case was very instructive, as it taught
me that over certain cases of puerperal fever opium has absolute
control.From the time here referred to, so long as the obstetrical service was
maintained at Bellevue Hospital, a large proportion of cases of this
fever, as they occurred, were sent to my wards, and in all these years
I have not lost faith in opium.This statement, however, requires an
explanation.Puerperal fever is a compound disease.Its great
inflammatory lesions are found in the uterus and its appendages and in
the peritoneum.{1148} When the inflammation of the uterus is the
dominant lesion, and is purulent, opium has little or perhaps no
control over its fatality; but in the cases in which peritonitis is the
ruling lesion, if begun early, it will show its power.In this
connection I will only add that in private practice the drug has been
perhaps more curative than in the hospital.I have seen many cases in
consultation, and a decided majority have recovered.In some instances
the patient has fallen into a pleasant sleep, only broken by some
administration, and ending with her recovery.In one instance a very
eminent physician had undertaken to treat a case by the opium plan, but
he had administered the drug so timidly that for fourteen days he had
done no more than hold the disease in check.After trial, I found that
I could not induce him to give the drug in my way, and I asked him to
give me sole charge of the patient for twenty-four hours.To this he
assented, remarking, "If you cure her, doctor, I will have it announced
to the profession that she was the sickest person I ever saw get well."In half the time allowed me I was able to establish the opium symptoms
as given farther on, and the lady slowly recovered.The treatment of any form of peritonitis by opium permits the use of
the drug itself, or of any extract or preparation of it which contains
its narcotic qualities, but it is wise to persevere with that one first
chosen unless there is strong reason for a change.This caution is
based on the fact that we cannot change from one to another and be
certain to obtain the same drug activity.For example, we begin with
laudanum, and find what it will do.We cannot take in its place the
sulphate of morphia with the certainty that we can so graduate it as to
get precisely the same effects.Then the quantity which will be
effectual in one case may be quite inadequate for the next.The
tolerance of opium in different persons varies remarkably, and probably
the disease itself increases the tolerance in all.This will be
illustrated by some of the details of this paper.The drug symptoms to be produced are as follows: Subsidence or marked
diminution of the pain; some or considerable tendency to sleep;
contraction of the pupils; reduction of the breathing to twelve
respirations in the minute; in the favorable cases a considerable
reduction in the frequency of the pulse; a gentle perspiration; an
itchy state of skin, or oftener of the nose; absolute inactivity of the
bowels, and after a time a subsidence of the tumor and tenderness in
them; some suffusion of the eyes.Of these several signs of opiumism there is none more easily observed
and none more valuable than the frequency of the respiration; and while
the physician aims to reduce it to twelve in a minute, there are
chances that he will see it fall to something below that.I have often
counted it at seven, and in perhaps two cases it fell to seven in two
minutes; and yet these cases of marked oppression from opium all
recovered.In the cases in which the respiration has fallen so low
there has been considerable obtuseness of the mind; but in no case
except in the hospital patient already referred to have I seen
unconsciousness.Then the sleepiness, so long as the patient is easily
awakened, is wholly within the limits of safety.As to the quantity of opium to be given, I have known two grains every
two hours do the work, and in other cases many times this {1149}
quantity was necessary to produce this condition of semi-narcotism.The
plan is to begin with a dose that is safe--say two or three grains of
opium or its equivalent of sulphate of morphia--and in two hours notice
its effects.If any of the opium symptoms have appeared, repeat the
dose; if none, increase by one grain, and so on at intervals of two
hours till the degree of tolerance in the patient is ascertained.After
that the case can be treated by a diminished occupation of the
physician's time--two or three visits a day.The dose is to be
increased if the opium symptoms diminish before the disease yields, but
always to be diminished or discontinued if narcotism is approaching.The duration of the treatment will be sometimes no more than two or
three days; it may be a week, or even a fortnight, and in one case
already mentioned the symptoms persisted mildly for forty days, and
then yielded.In this case the medicine used was the sulphate of
morphia, and the enormous dose reached by steady and graduated increase
was one grain and a quarter every forty minutes in a boy ten years old.In some puerperal cases the doses have been so large as to require
witnesses to make the statement of them credible, and the
administration of them criminal had not the effect of each dose been
carefully studied and the amount of each measured by the action or
inadequate action of the next preceding one.Here are the doses given a woman who fell sick October 13, 1857; the
record was made by C. H. Rawson during the treatment, and was kindly
given me two or three years ago: On the first appearance of her
disease, while the diagnosis was uncertain, 10 grains of Dover's powder
gave her a quiet night.The next day the disease was more manifest, and
she took of Magendie's solution (2 grains of sulphate of morphine to a
drachm of water) x minims every hour; growing worse, at night she took
xxx minims every hour; the next day, xl minims every hour, and no
change of symptoms.She took in twenty-four hours 32 grains of sulphate
of morphia; slept, but was awakened by the slightest noise.On the
fourth day 3-1/3 drachms of the solution, and opium as follows: at 4
P.M., 3 gr.; at 5 P.M., 4 gr.; at 6 P.M., 5 gr.; at 7 P.M., 6 gr., and
6 gr.Fifth day, in twenty-six hours
took in opium and morphine the equivalent of 208 gr.of opium; on the seventh day, 221 gr.of opium; on
the eighth, 224 gr.; on the ninth, the same quantity; on the tenth, the
same; on the eleventh, 247 gr., pulse subsiding; on the twelfth, 261
gr., other symptoms better; on the thirteenth, 144 gr.hourly; slept for the first time heavily, all other symptoms
improving, bowels moved freely, ate well, tympanites subsiding;
fifteenth day, 1 gr.of opium every two hours, and at night the last
dose.The woman denied the opium habit, and the
medicines were tested by the apothecary.Such doses can only find their
justification in the demonstrated fact that smaller doses will not
produce the degree of narcotism desired.In Keating's edition of Ramsbotham's _Midwifery_ a case is reported by
myself in which a woman, by pretty rapidly increasing doses, reached
forty-eight grain doses of opium, with the effect of curing her disease
and substituting a temporary active delirium.A word of caution is probably necessary regarding the use of opium in
high doses when peritonitis and Bright's disease coexist.I have {1150}
already said that I have but scanty personal knowledge of such a
concurrence, but in Bright's disease alone I have known a large,
non-heroic dose of an opiate fatal.For example: A young man had a
felon on his finger, and did not sleep, so great was his pain.His
physician prescribed 40 drops of laudanum at bedtime.Not sleeping on
this, he took another portion of 40 drops, and in the morning he was
found in a comatose condition, and in the course of the day he died.A
post-mortem examination revealed Bright's disease, which was not before
suspected.A woman took half a grain of the sulphate of morphine--for
what reason I do not know.I was called to see her when she was in a
semi-comatose state.The time between my seeing her and that of taking
the morphine was fourteen or fifteen hours; its removal from the body
was therefore hopeless.Her limbs were swollen with oedema, and the
urine contained albumen and casts.Although the usual means of opposing
the poisonous effects of opium were resorted to, they were of little
use, and the patient died in the course of the day.These are selected
from a considerable number of similar cases that show a similarity in
their action on the brain of opium and urea.It seems that opium
precipitates the uraemic coma, yet the coma produced by these agents
combined is not so profound as that produced by opium alone.There is
in it some movement of the limbs or body or some imperfect utterances,
yet it seems to be more fatal than the coma of opium unaided.Notwithstanding all this, I have met with several cases of cardiac
disease combined with Bright's--perhaps I should say many--in which
half a grain of morphia sulphate has been taken every night to procure
sleep with only beneficial results.This has been observed several
times when physicians have been the patients.These facts are stated to show the hesitation and prudence that should
control the administration of opium when there is urea in the blood,
whether there is peritonitis or not; but a case in which one form of
Bright's disease preceded, and perhaps caused, peritonitis will be more
instructive: A gentleman sixty-eight years of age was attacked by
peritonitis on Thursday evening.There was a moderate chill at the
onset (this being one of the few cases in which I have witnessed this
occurrence).The diagnosis was then uncertain, and he took quieting
doses of Dover's powder, which gave him sleep.The next day the
diagnosis was easily made.The urine was examined for albumen, and none
found.He took only six-eighths of a grain of
sulphate of morphine in the first twenty hours.It was then increased,
so that in the next twenty-four hours he took two grains of the
sulphate in divided doses--a quantity which has been greatly exceeded
in hundreds of cases with the best results; but in this case coma was
the result.on Sunday he was comatose, but not profoundly;
he could be aroused.The breaths were five in the minute, the pulse
increasing in frequency; secretion of urine next to none.After seven hours, while the respiration was growing
more natural, the pulse grew more frequent and the stupor increased.the breathing was fifteen in the minute, and full and
perfectly easy, but the pulse was running at 140, and the coma
unbroken, and the pupils of good size.The effects of the opiate had
passed off, but those of uraemia were profound.After the alarming symptoms occurred we tried to procure another
specimen of the urine for fuller examination, but {1151} could not.It
was only after his death that we procured the evidences that he had
shown symptoms of contracted kidney for months.The urine contained no
albumen at the time of our examination, as very often happens in that
disease.Regarding other points in the opium treatment there is little to be
said.The bowels should be left
entirely at rest till they recover their muscular tone; then they will
expel first the gas, and then the feces; or if, after the inflammation
is subdued, they do not move of their own accord, injections are
admissible.I have often left the bowels absolutely inactive for
fourteen days without any recognizable consequences.If I meet a
physician who believes that leeches are essential, I yield him his
point, but never advise them.I do this because a moderate bloodletting
will do no harm, and little if any good.The same rule I apply to
irritating applications to the surface of the abdomen.Mercurials, I
think, are harmful, and therefore I object to them.As to food, it
should be milk, fresh eggs beaten up with water and pleasantly
flavored, peptones, etc.selected from among those that leave no
refuse.The testimony of physicians who have adopted this plan within my own
circle is unanimously in favor of it.B. R. Palmer of Woodstock, Vt.,
afterward of Louisville, Ky., who was the first to test it, told me
after a few years' trial that he used to dread peritonitis as he would
dread the plague, but with opium in his pocket he met it cheerfully and
hopefully, as he did a pneumonia.Chalmers of New York, who is known by
many readers of this article, has a very extensive practice, and he
told me lately that he had not had a fatal case of peritonitis in
twenty-two years.From whom did the profession
adopt it?In 1836-37, I visited daily the hospitals of London,
Edinburgh, and Paris, was in frequent intercourse with the physicians
of those cities, and never saw a patient anywhere treated by opium, and
never heard the least allusion to it.I can safely appeal to any
physician who was familiar with the history of the profession before
the year 1840, or for two or three years later perhaps, to inquire
whether anything was generally known regarding this treatment of
peritonitis, or whether he himself ever heard of it.Let the inquiry be
made of Willard Parker of New York or Alfred Stille of
Philadelphia--men of a degree of intelligence and learning that has
made them leaders in the profession--and of all the profession at that
time.I venture to assume that they were as ignorant as I was of what
Graves and Stokes had done.The following fact is significant: In 1843, Graves published _A System
of Clinical Medicine_, the preface of which is dated January, 1843.In
this he says he had previously published essays, lectures, and articles
in several medical journals.In this volume he intends, he says, "to
revise what I have written, and to compress the whole within the limits
of a single volume."There is nothing in the table of contents or
explanatory headings of the several chapters of this volume which
alludes to treating peritonitis by opium.It is fair to infer that the
cases treated in 1823 had made little impression on his mind, and that
he did not think his treatment could take rank as a discovery; and yet
Stokes had made favorable mention of it eleven years before this
publication.Graves, then, did not {1152} publish his cases, and the
first knowledge which the profession could have of them was through
Stokes's paper, published in the _Dublin Journal of Medical and
Chemical Science_, No.Perhaps the reason why Stokes's
paper produced so little impression on the profession may be found in
the fact that first numbers of journals of every sort have few readers.Anyway, it was not till after the opium treatment had attracted much
attention in this country that anybody here knew that Graves or Stokes
had ever had anything to do with it.Besides, Graves and Stokes had
only used opium in cases of perforation, and they had no plan or
symptomatic guide in the use of the drug.There is something new and strange in the following case copied from
the _Medical Record_ of May 12, 1883, under the heading, "Operative
Measures in Acute Peritonitis:" "Dr.Reibel relates the case of a
child, eight years old, suffering from acute idiopathic peritonitis.The disease had resisted all treatment, and the child being,
apparently, about to die, it was determined to open the abdomen with a
view to removing the fluid and washing out the peritoneal cavity with a
solution of carbolic acid.No fluid was
found in the abdominal cavity.In prolonging the incision a loop of the
intestine was punctured, as evidenced by the escape of gas and
intestinal fluid.The wound was washed with carbolic acid and covered
with a layer of antiseptic cotton.The following day the little patient
was nearly free from pain, and was able to retain a little milk.The
temperature had fallen from 104 degrees to 101 degrees, and the
tympanitis was almost entirely gone.The (wounded) loop of intestine
was adherent to the abdominal wall, and there had been no escape of
fluid into the peritoneal cavity.The patient made an excellent
recovery."If the statements of this abstract are true, and the future supports
the practice pursued in this case, acute peritonitis is likely to
become a surgical rather than a medical disease.Reibel thinks that
opening the intestine in the way he did is a better plan than the
punctures with the exploring-needle to relieve the patient of the
tympanitis.But it will require more facts than one to persuade the
profession that this mishap of the scalpel can grow into a rule of
practice.(The _Record_ finds this report in the _Journal de Medecine
de Paris_.)I cannot say that I see the value of a distinction made in 1877 by
Gubler between peritonitis and peritonism.By the latter term is meant
the total of nervous and other symptoms that arise in the course of
peritonitis.Trasour has lately revived this distinction, and thinks it
important, and that a light peritonitis may be attended by a grave
peritonism.He holds that the distinction is important, because "the
treatment of peritonism consists in the administration of alcohol,
chloral, and especially of opium in large doses.Of the latter fifteen
grains may be given in twenty-four hours.""The symptoms [of
peritonism] are produced through the agency of the great
sympathetic."[6]

[Footnote 6: _Med.I cannot say that I have seen great effects follow small causes, but
think that, in general, the effects of peritonitis on the pulse,
strength, nervous tone, etc.are, to some extent at least, a measure of
its severity.CONSEQUENCES OF PERITONITIS.--These are usually nothing.When recovery
takes place it is commonly complete, but cases have been known {1153}
in which the intestines have been left bound to the abdominal wall and
to each other, and so made incapable of their natural action.The
results of this are a swollen, tympanitic abdomen and impaction of the
bowels, but the general health may be very good.A woman at Bellevue
was left in this condition, yet she performed the duties of nurse in
one of the wards for some years, and finally disappeared from the
institution, and I do not know how it ended with her--probably by the
breaking up of the adhesions and a return of the bowels to their
natural condition.In some few cases there remains new tissue, which in time is partly
broken up and remains partly attached.In this manner strings and bands
of considerable strength can be formed, and into these loops the
intestine may pass, so as to form an internal hernia of a very
dangerous character.In some bands are formed across the intestine,
which by contraction flatten the tube and obstruct the fecal movement.There is reason to believe that such bands and bridles are formed by
local inflammation of such imperfect manifestation by symptoms that the
patient knows nothing about it.A very striking case illustrating the
possible sequence of this inflammation came under my observation early
in my professional life: A <DW52> woman about twenty-five years of age
gave a very clear history of a peritonitis from the consequences of
which she had suffered two years before I saw her.About six months
after recovery she began to have constipation and to suffer from small
and frequent discharges of urine.The latter gradually grew milky and
to have a bad odor; the constipation grew more and more, and at length
came to be absolute for many days; then would come a diarrhoea of some
hours' continuance, after which she would have a feeling of relief.She was emaciated, and so feeble as
hardly able to leave her bed.She vomited occasionally, and her
appetite for food was all gone.The urine was heavily loaded with pus,
and was ammoniacal.At post-mortem
examination a firm membrane was found strained across the upper strait
of the pelvis, wholly separating the abdominal cavity from the pelvic.The left posterior border was drawn very
tensely over the colon where it passed into the pelvic cavity,
flattening it down completely and making stricture.To the under or
lower surface the fundus of the uterus and the base of the bladder were
firmly adherent, and in this way both were suspended.The effect of
this unnatural suspension of the inactive uterus did not seem to be
noticeable, but with the bladder it was very different: it contained
three to four ounces of water, ammoniacal and full of pus, and it could
never have emptied itself.During the
peritonitis a false membrane was effused on the pelvic viscera in situ.When the period of contraction which is common to all such structures
came, the new membrane was separated from the greater part of these two
organs, but not from their bases.The firm attachment to the brim of
the pelvis did the rest.So unusual a sequel of peritonitis I think
deserves a record.I should add there were no adhesions above the
pelvis.Such a structure as this, found long after the active symptoms
of peritonitis have passed, as also the bands and cords before spoken
of, does not give support to the doctrine that the false membranes are
broken down into fatty matter, and in this condition absorbed.{1154} The possible remote effects of peritonitis are shown in a case
reported by E. A. Mearns to the _Medical Record_, published Sept.15,
1883: A young man, aged nineteen, four years after he had had acute
general peritonitis was attacked with constipation, which was absolute.He had had before occasional attacks of pain in the bowels and
constipation, which were overcome.He had the
train of symptoms usual in intestinal obstruction.There was no fever
or tympanitis, and this time but little pain.There was a tangle and a constriction of the intestines at the middle
of the ileum, caused by the contraction and hardening of the effusion
of the old peritonitis, and the intestine was very much softened.H. B. Sands reports in another number of the same journal: "The patient
was a man about thirty who had suffered from acute obstruction for a
week.When the abdomen was opened the
intestinal coils were found extremely adherent one to another in
consequence of a former peritonitis.A careful search failed to
discover the nature or seat of the obstruction.The abdominal wound was
closed, and the patient died soon after."There is no part of the gastro-intestinal canal that may not, from one
cause or another, become the seat of ulceration.The jejunum is the
part of the tube long supposed to be an exception to this rule, but
even in it one or two observers have found ulcers.These ulcers often
exist without distinctive symptoms, and may go on to cicatrization
without announcing themselves.In the stomach, however, there are
commonly indications which will admit a conjecture of their existence,
and perhaps a diagnosis.Sometimes these ulcers penetrate all the
tissues of the tube and allow the contents of the intestine to escape
into the peritoneal cavity, or they may have destroyed all but the
external layer, and some succussion, as in coughing, sneezing,
laughing, or perhaps straining at stool, may make the opening complete,
with the same results.In these cases it seems to be inevitable that
inflammation should follow, unless it has preceded, the complete
opening and sealed it up by adhesions.The tendency of such an
inflammation is to be local and limited, but when the contents of
intestines escape into the peritoneal cavity it usually becomes
general.These accidents are usually attended by the sudden development
of local pain, by rapid increase in the frequency of the pulse,
paleness, and prostration.The perforation of the vermiform appendix is
often a partial exception to this statement, for, while the local
symptoms are marked, the sympathy of the general system is not so
quickly awakened.The same can be said of perityphlitis.The symptoms
are often local for some time--a day or more; sometimes subside, as if
the disease were cured, and then return in full form.This is produced
by the tendency of the inflammation to limit itself to the immediate
neighborhood of its cause.Lymph is effused at a short distance from
the point of irritation, and seals the parts together, so as to shut in
the offending substance; and though this substance may produce pus in
contact with intestine or appendix, that {1155} fluid is held for a
time, as in abscess.It may be permanently held in its new-made sac
till it burrows into some near part, as the intestine or bladder, or
remain an abscess till opened by Willard Parker's puncture.On the
other hand, the contents of this sac may be increased till it breaks
bounds and causes extension of the peritoneal inflammation or general
peritonitis.In one particular case this process of setting limits and
breaking through them occurred in a young lady four times at intervals
of from one to two days.When the limiting adhesions were established
symptoms would subside, so as to encourage in her physicians the hope,
even the expectation, of recovery; but again and again the fire was
rekindled, and she died eight days after the first attack.In the
greater number of cases the first breaking of the adhesions is followed
by full peritonitis, and this often by death.The perforations of the stomach which I have seen have not been
attended by the severe pain described by most authors, but by a sudden
prostration of strength and a feeling of disquiet and sinking at the
stomach; more of collapse than of inflammation in the symptoms; no
tumefaction of the bowels; almost nothing to indicate the nature of the
accident, but a sudden new sensation in the bowels, a rapid increase in
the frequency of the pulse, it growing small as it increases in
rapidity, and a pale and shrunken countenance, and death in from twelve
to thirty hours.Then, on inspection, hardly any signs of peritonitis
are found.The peritoneal vessels are fuller and the membrane redder
than in health, and its surface covered with the thinnest possible film
of lymphy exudation, and some serum in the deeper parts of the cavity.These ulcerations of the stomach are not always fatal by peritonitis.A
few instances are recorded in which adhesions of the outer surface of
the organ to adjoining organs have taken place, so as to protect the
peritoneum almost wholly from the fatal contact with the gastric
fluids, and death has occurred in some other way.I have a remarkable
specimen illustrating this fact.It was taken from the body of a woman
of about middle age who had long had symptoms of dyspepsia, and had
from time to time vomited a little blood.It was not difficult to
recognize ulcer, but the extent and peculiarities of it could be
learned only by inspection.She died suddenly of copious haematemesis.On examination an ulcer two and a half to three inches in its several
diameters was found, beginning near the pylorus and extending toward
the left, which in this large space had destroyed all the coats of the
stomach and exposed an inch and more of the right extremity of the
pancreas and about the same extent of the liver.The liver and pancreas
were both perceptibly eroded when exposed, and in the latter an artery
that would admit the head of a large pin was opened.The stomach,
outside of this extraordinary ulcer, was strongly attached to the
adjacent organs.The ulcerations of typhoid fever penetrate the intestine about three
times in a hundred cases of the fever.This result is reached by the
study of a large number of cases, and appears to be pretty generally
admitted.The point where this perforation occurs is in the ileum, near
the ileo-caecal valve--within a foot or eighteen inches of it in the
great majority of cases, although it has been known to occur
seventy-two inches above the valve, and it has been seen very rarely in
the caecum.The fever itself may be either severe or mild.Suddenly
severe pain {1156} sets in, oftenest in the lower part of the abdomen,
and spreads rapidly; the pulse is quickly accelerated and becomes
small; and it has been lately stated that in this and other intestinal
perforations the gases of the bowels, escaping into the peritoneal
cavity, will give resonance to percussion over the lower part of the
liver.Fetid gas found in this cavity after death is not without
importance; for example, a distinguished Senator at Washington died not
long ago of a very painful abdominal disease which his physicians
declined to relieve with opium, though the patient pleaded for it.Although the distance he had to
travel was many hundred miles, he found the patient alive and still
suffering.He at once gave morphine for the relief of the pain, but the
patient died.Now, this gentleman had diabetes a year or more before
his death, recognized by his physician at home and also by myself.While under my observation the urine ceased to contain sugar and its
quantity became normal, but soon after this albumen was occasionally
found in it.The quantity was generally small, and casts were only
found now and then.This new disease was mild, and seemed to be, within
certain limits, manageable.He went to Washington under injunction that
he was not to let official and professional labors bear with any weight
upon him.This last sickness and the death would naturally enough be
supposed to be some new phase or consequence of the previous illness.But, while a post-mortem examination was not permitted, the family
wished to have the body embalmed.The family physician accompanied the
embalmer, and as the latter made a cut through the abdominal walls
there was a gush of air laden with fecal odor, and he through this
opening saw the intestines covered with false membrane.He satisfied
himself that the intestine was not opened.This fetid gas came from the
peritoneal cavity.An ulcer had perforated the intestine somewhere, and
caused the death.The final disease could be only remotely dependent on
the patient's previous illness, if at all.His impaired health may have
made the ulcer possible.All kinds of perforations in the bowels, except those of the stomach,
caecum, and appendix, even the cancerous, have one history and the same
symptoms; and if treatment is ever successful in such occurrences it
must all be based on one set of rules--absolute rest, no pressure on
the bowels, and no movements of the muscles that will aggravate it;
food that will be wholly digested and absorbed by the stomach; complete
abstinence from cathartic and laxative medicines, and the free
administration of opium or morphine.By these means, I fully believe,
numbers have already been saved from the fatal consequences of
peritonitis caused by perityphlitis and perforation of the vermiform
appendix--some under my own observation and others under that of my
friends.A boy fourteen years of age was brought to bed by a pain in
the right iliac fossa.After a few hours his father, a physician,
desired me to see him.There was already a perceptible fulness, with
dulness on percussion, in the fossa, and some febrile excitement.I
gave a portion of morphine, and promised to call the next morning.In
the morning a message came from the father stating that the boy was
better and there was no need of further attendance.The pain had returned, and had spread over most of the
bowels.He took tincture of opium, of which
I believe the largest dose was 100 {1157} drops, reached after three or
four days of gradual but steady increase of dose.From that point the
patient got better, and the quantity of the medicine was
correspondingly reduced.There were a relapse and a repetition of the
treatment, and again the disease yielded.During convalescence, about
fourteen days from the attack, the boy, after emptying his bladder, was
suddenly pressed to continue the discharge.Now he voided what appeared
to be blood, two or three tablespoonfuls.It was, however, pus with
blood enough to color it.This purulent discharge from the bladder
continued for about three weeks, the boy steadily recovering his
health.This occurred twenty or more years ago, and that boy is now a
well-known physician.In 1850, or thereabout, I attended a physician through an attack of
typhoid fever.In the third week there was a sudden outbreak of
peritonitis.The opium treatment was resorted to, and he recovered, and
had good health for twenty years after.Peritonitis occurs rarely in
typhoid fever from any other cause than perforation, and its occurrence
in this case at this time, when perforation is more likely to occur,
renders it probable, at least, that this attack was produced by that
cause.March 3, 1883, autopsy of Wm.Fletcher, age 59, iron-worker.23d, he was attacked with pain in the region of the right
iliac fossa; it was severe.There was no chill, but little fever, and
only slight acceleration of the pulse.His stomach was a good deal
disturbed, and the bowels were soon distended with flatus.I saw him on
the Tuesday following, with James D. Elliott.The bowels were a good
deal swollen and very resonant on percussion; pulse 84.His stomach was
still greatly disturbed, so that he retained no food, yet there was no
green vomit, but much flatulency.The movements in respiration were
particularly noticeable, being nearly or quite as much abdominal as in
health.There was a short friction sound in inspiration, but an entire
absence of the sound produced by peristaltic action.There was no
dulness on percussing over the iliac fossa, and no pain on pressure
over any part of the abdomen.I was careful in examining the right
fossa, for the first pain was there, and it was severe; but there was
no physical sign by which the perforation could be ascertained.Still,
my mind dwelt on the probability of perforation, and I expressed my
fears to Elliott regarding it.The bowels had not moved for two or three days.The next day Flint was added to the consultation.The symptoms had
changed but little; the pulse was 102; no pain, no tenderness, no
peristaltic action; slight friction at one point only; the abdominal
respiration was as marked as before.Frequency of respiration, 18;
patient sleepy; pupils only slightly contracted.When we were in
consultation I again expressed my fear of perforation, but Flint
expressed the most decided opinion as to its absence, because there was
dulness to percussion over the liver.I had read his paper on the
intrusion of gas between the ribs and liver in cases of intestinal
perforation, and felt as if I were almost reproved for entertaining the
thought without this physical corroboration.Thursday, March 1st, the stomach had become much more retentive; there
were no pain and no tenderness on pressure; pulse 109; no friction
sound, no sound of peristaltic action, no dulness on percussion over
right iliac fossa, but resonance over the whole abdomen, excepting over
the {1158} pubes; there the resonance was not clear; over a small space
there was dulness; this was ascribed to moderate fulness of the
bladder, and, as there had been no difficulty in emptying it, nothing
was said of it.The abdominal respiratory movements were the same as
before.Friday morning, at 3 A.M., no marked change had occurred in the
symptoms, but from this time onward there was a steady sinking of the
vital powers.The pulse grew small and frequent, the hands became cool,
the breathing more frequent, and without any sudden change or new
symptom he died early in the morning.At the last visit there was no
resonance on percussion over the liver.Autopsy, Saturday, March 3d, 2 P.M.The bowels were distended, as they
mostly are in peritonitis, but not extraordinarily.There was now
pretty free resonance over the liver.The section to open the abdominal
cavity was carefully made, with the aim of ascertaining whether there
was air or gas in the peritoneal cavity.When a half-inch opening was
made through the peritoneum, gas was forced out through it for some
seconds with an unmistakable noise.The bowels were not opened by this
cut.The bowels exposed, a very thin film of false membrane was found
on all the middle and upper portions of the intestines, with a fringe
of injection where the folds came in contact.But two or three inches
above the symphysis pubis the section opened a collection of pus which
extended downward into the pelvis.Somewhere hereabout--neither of us
could say exactly where--was found a lump of fecal matter, not
indurated, as large as a marrowfat pea, the intestine still unopened.Search was made for the vermiform appendix.At first it was not
recognized on account of its remarkable shortness.It was found,
however, pointing directly toward the median line of the body, and was
short because a part had been separated from the rest by slough.The
end of what remained was marked by a border, one-eighth of an inch
deep, of a very dark-green gangrenous color.We did not attempt to
measure the quantity of pus.It was
completely bounded and shut in by adhesions.At no time during life was there resonance over the liver, but there
was some at the time of post-mortem examination before the bowels were
opened, due perhaps to the fact that at death the relaxation of the
muscles allowed the gas to rise higher than it did during life.The
unusual median position of the abscess is important in accounting for
absence of dulness, when it is usually found in slough or ulcer of the
vermiform appendix."A Fatal Case of Typhlitis without Recognizable Symptoms."Under this
title Jose M. Fisser published a case of inflammation of the vermiform
appendix causing general peritonitis in a young woman nineteen years of
age.The peculiarities of the case were that the appendix was not
perforated, and consequently there was no tumor in the right iliac
fossa--that the symptoms were all referred to the epigastrium, without
even tenderness in the fossa.She walked the floor and tossed about in
bed; the highest temperature was 103 degrees, and the most frequent
pulse was 120, and these continued but a short time.Of tympanitis
there was none till near death, and then but little.The obscurity in
diagnosis led to the publication of the case.The cause of this disease
was fecal matter, not very hard, in the appendix.[7]

[Footnote 7: _Med.{1159} As much has been said in this article on the diagnosis of
peritonitis, it may be well to introduce a case where that diagnosis
was conjectural, and yet quite another state existed.H----, when her disease was advanced, twice.My impression was that she
had peritonitis, but this opinion was held with grave doubt.After her
death, Smith sent me the following record of the autopsy: "Mrs.H----
died Friday evening at ten o'clock; next day, at three in the
afternoon, we made an autopsy.No gas or fluid in the peritoneal
cavity; the small intestines inflated almost to bursting, with
injection of the capillaries.In the left iliac region we at once
discovered a portion of the intestine almost black, and on examination
found a firm white band encircling and constricting that portion.Upon
liberating the gas the intestines collapsed, and the constricted
portion was released and easily removed.A further examination showed
that two of the epiploic appendages, coming off from the colon above
the sigmoid flexure, had united at their extreme points and formed a
loop two and a half to three inches long, and through this loop or ring
a portion of the ileum had passed, and was there constricted.The
constricted intestine was about four feet in length.This examination
has been gratifying to me.There was a small quantity of bloody serum
in the peritoneal cavity low down in the pelvis.The dark grumous blood
that passed the bowels on the second and third days can now be
accounted for, and corroborates your remark that the hemorrhage looked
like strangulation.This must be a new
cause of strangulation, and one that we could not anticipate."There was, before I saw her, a single vomit of a suspicious fluid, but
the evidence was not strong enough to enable us to pronounce it
stercoraceous.Some of the observers noticed bloody serum in the
peritoneal cavity, and perhaps some shreds of lymph, but that was in
consequence of the strangulation.This may occur anywhere in the broad extent of the peritoneum, and will
be more or less limited in different cases, or may be limited for a
time, and then become general.The
product of the diseased action may be serum or lymph or pus, or all of
them.The cause of this local inflammation is sometimes very obvious,
in other cases wholly unknown.The consequences vary all the way from
harmlessness to death; the symptoms are as variable as the
consequences, making the diagnosis easy in some cases, in others
impossible.Some cases in which it was not difficult to recognize it
have already been recorded--those caused by perityphlitis and
perforation of the vermiform appendix, for example.In such cases the
local pain, the swelling, the dulness or resonance on percussion,
depending on whether the tumor is made by inflammatory exudation or
gas, together with the general symptoms and the history, leave but
little ground for doubt regarding the character of the disease.Perhaps
one-half the local abscesses which form between the folds of the
peritoneum are recognizable during life by the local, associated with
the general, symptoms.When situated in the posterior and upper part of
the abdominal cavity, the hand gives little, {1160} perhaps no,
assistance, as in the most widely-known case of abscess that has been
recorded in all time.While the physicians were giving to the country
hopeful reports day by day, thousands of medical men shook their heads
and spoke sadly of the prospects.The illustrious patient was losing
rather than gaining strength and flesh, his appetite poor, his
digestion poor--a strong man growing helpless--and, above all, a pulse
that for months never fell below 100.With an adequate cause of
abscess, whether there were chills or not, what else could it be?Thus,
in peritoneal abscesses that cannot be felt the general symptoms are of
great importance to the diagnosis.When abscesses tend to discharge
their contents soon or late--sometimes into the intestine, sometimes
into the bladder, sometimes externally: in such cases there is a fair
chance.Sometimes they burst into the peritoneum: such cases are almost
inevitably fatal; even opium will not cure them.The pus of these
abscesses often has the fecal odor, which it acquires by the
transmission of the intestinal gases through the intestinal walls.I
was attending, with the late James R. Wood, a young lady in whom
peritoneal abscess had been recognized.It was anterior to the
intestines.In the consultation, while we were discussing the propriety
of using the trocar, the mother became alarmed at the odor and
appearance of the urine just passed, and summoned the doctors back to
the chamber.The urine
contained pus which gave off the fecal odor strongly.It should be added that these abscesses, as well as those of
the convex surface of the liver and those that are post-peritoneal,
sometimes pierce the diaphragm and produce empyema, or by previous
adhesion of the lung to its upper surface find a way into a bronchial
tube, and so the pus is expectorated.The history of local fibrinous exudations is not as easily told as that
of the purulent.We find from time to time, on the peritoneum, bands,
patches, or cords of false membrane, which were produced in so quiet a
way that we can get no information regarding the time when they were
formed, and perhaps the subject of them was not aware that anything was
wrong with the bowels till he began to have the symptoms of
obstruction.The omentum is found thickened and contracted.The mesentery and
mesocolon are seen in a similar condition, causing wrinkling and
shortening of the bowels.The spleen has on its surface patches or even
plates, or one great plate, of firm fibrinous deposit, often
cartilaginous in density, sometimes calcareous; and we can rarely fix
the time of these occurrences by any symptoms.It is not always so with
the liver.We are acquainted with a perihepatitis which is acute,
attended by pain in the right side, a febrile movement, and, if the
inflammation reaches the under surface of the organ, by jaundice, and
have learned to combat this with cups and opiates, the latter in rather
free but not heroic doses, and to expect recovery in a few days.This
may leave the liver wholly or partly invested with a layer of false
membrane which may have a sequel of importance.Then, again, we find
the organ invested with a thick contractile membrane, but cannot learn
that the symptoms of perihepatitis have ever occurred.The diseased
action which produced this bad investment appears to be analogous to
that which not only covers the organ with a thinner coat of similar new
tissue, but inlays it everywhere with the same material in cirrhosis.This also is {1161} unattended by local pain.The effects that may
result from this encasing of the liver in a strong contractile capsule
may be illustrated by the following case (the late Buck was the
physician): The patient was an unmarried lady of middle age who had
consecrated her life to charitable works.In searching for the
suffering poor she often had to ascend several flights of stairs.The
time came when she found this fatiguing and a tax on her respiration.She observed at the same time that the bowels were enlarged.She called
Buck, and he had no difficulty in discovering ascitic fluid.He was
surprised, as he knew that her habits were perfectly good, and she had
very little the appearance of an invalid.Notwithstanding the proper
use of the usual remedies for dropsy, the fluid slowly increased, and
at length he was obliged to draw it off.He found it to be a clear,
yellowish serum.In the course of about two years she was tapped four
times.I saw her, with Buck, after these tappings, when the fluid had
again been effused in quantity that half filled the peritoneal cavity.The emaciation was not considerable; there was nothing of the
semi-bronzed color of the skin so common in cirrhosis of similar
duration; her appetite and digestion were not materially impaired; the
temperature was natural; the pulse was increased in frequency only a
few beats.The skin over the abdomen was in a soft, natural state, and
there was nothing that suggested a hyperaemic or inflammatory dropsy.The liver on percussion appeared to be reduced in size.Taking all
things into account, and especially the patient's habits and the
absence cancerous cachexia, it seemed probable that the dropsy arose
from atrophy of the liver, and that the atrophy was caused by an
adventitious capsule of the organ, although the patient had never had
symptoms of perihepatitis.From this point the fluid did not increase
or diminish, but remained stationary till she died, perhaps two years
after, of some other disease.Meanwhile, the lady resumed her favorite
charity-work to a limited extent.At the post-mortem examination the
capsule was found investing nearly the whole liver, but not materially
obstructing the gall-duct.The new membrane was thick and strong,
having a thickness of at least one-twentieth of an inch.The remaining
liver structure was of natural appearance.The organ was reduced to
one-half its natural size.I have doubted whether any disease deserving this name really exists
independent of such low inflammatory action as may arise from the
irritations of tumors or heterologous deposits.This statement refers
to general not local peritonitis.I have never seen anything that would
lead me to believe that acute diffuse peritonitis can be deprived of
its acute character and still continue an inflammation.With me it has
always been death or cure.I have already referred to a case in which
after recovery the bowels were greatly disturbed by tympanitis for
years.But this came from adhesions: her general health was good.I
have at long intervals met with cases of ascites in which the
peritoneal membrane was redder than natural, and in which no
obstruction to the portal {1162} circulation was discovered.This,
however, I have regarded as hyperaemia rather than inflammation.Bauer,[8] however, gives to these cases the title latent general
peritonitis, especially when after death an abnormal adhesion is found
here and there.In the cases that I have seen there was a peculiar
state of the surface of the abdomen.The skin there was more or less
scaly and dry, but I do not remember whether there were internal
adhesions.Bauer regards the diagnosis of this form of disease as
difficult, but refers to the constantly present meteorism as well as
serous fluid.I have met with three or four instances in which at the
time of puberty an abdominal dropsy has rather suddenly occurred,
lasting one to three months, and disappearing on the use of diuretics.I have had no reason to attribute this effusion to inflammatory action,
except in one case.A lady of extraordinary symmetry and beauty of
form, in excellent health, whom I had treated for this disorder twelve
years before, applied to know whether there was anything in that
disease that would prevent her having children.She had been married
seven or eight years, and had not been pregnant.The question then
occurred to me, At the time of the dropsy could there have been lymphy
exudation that has since confined the ovaries in an unnatural position?The treatment which Bauer prefers for
his latent peritonitis consists in "painting with iodine, the use of
diuretics, and the regulation of diaphoresis by means of Turkish
baths."[Footnote 8: _Cyclopaedia of the Practice, etc._, vol.Another form of general chronic peritonitis is, according to Bauer,
that which follows acute peritonitis.He quotes several authorities in
support of his views.I must draw on him for a description of it, for,
as I have said, practically I know nothing about it.The symptoms of acute peritonitis are all toned down, but do not all
disappear.Vomiting occurs occasionally; tenderness is diminished, but
is quite perceptible; meteorism diminishes, but fluctuates greatly;
appetite is poor or variable; constipation alternates with diarrhoea or
is followed by dysentery; now there is a febrile heat, and then the
temperature is normal--this fever is most likely to come in the
evening; the pulse is frequent and varying; ultimately extreme
emaciation and anaemia.The most striking feature of this condition
appears to be sacculation of the fluid in the abdomen, wholly or
partially; this fluid then is not freely movable, but will give dulness
on percussion, which may contrast well with intestinal resonance in its
immediate neighborhood.When the tension of the abdominal wall is
diminished these sacs can be felt by the hand as uneven tumors.Colicky
pains occur, and in a case cited it was at one time very severe, at
another only slight.The majority of the cases terminate, after a
protracted course, fatally.Recovery may occur by absorption or
external evacuation of the fluid.Bauer makes still another class of cases of chronic peritonitis--those
arising in the course of old ascites; he, however, does not make much
out of it.He thinks the cases of this kind occur with cardiac and
hepatic disease, and particularly with the nutmeg liver.The symptoms,
he admits, are neither well defined nor severe, and the anatomical
changes consist "in thickening of the serous membrane by a slight
deposit of fibrin, {1163} slight turbidity of the ascitic fluid, and a
few flakes of fibrin suspended in it."He then, strangely, gives, as if
they were illustrations of such a disease, two cases in which death by
acute peritonitis followed the last of many tappings, in one of which a
pool of pus was found encysted in front of the intestines.Probably most practitioners who are in the habit of making post-mortem
examinations have seen the flakes of lymph in the ascitic fluid, etc.,
but the German physicians have been the first, I believe, to regard
such cases as belonging to separate forms of disease.William Pepper has published[9] a case observed by himself and G. A.
Rex which shows non-malignant chronic peritonitis better than any I can
recall to mind.The report forms the sequel to the case of the young
woman on whom he successfully performed paracentesis of the
pericardium.This young woman began to have double pleuritic effusion, and this was
soon followed by ascites three and a half months after the operation.From that time the ascites was better or worse, but did not wholly
leave her, and became considerable before her death.This was sudden,
she having some convulsive movements in extremis.Lesions were found in
the thoracic cavity like those discovered in the abdominal, showing, it
was believed, a special tendency in this person to plastic exudation on
the serous membranes."The lower part of the abdomen was found occupied
by an extensive effusion.There
were few if any signs of inflammation of the intestinal peritoneum, but
marked changes were observed in the parietal peritoneum and in the
capsules of the liver and spleen.The peritonitis was most marked in
the upper segment of the abdomen, while the parietal membrane presented
large patches of irregular thickening.No tubercles were found on any
part of the peritoneum.The capsules of the liver and spleen were
greatly thickened, whitish, opaque, and densely fibrous.The liver was
enlarged and heavy, and so tightly bound by its thickened capsule that
its shape was somewhat altered."The diaphragm, especially that part of it underlying the pericardial
sacs, had undergone marked fibroid degeneration.The muscular tissue
was much atrophied; many fasciculi had evidently disappeared, while
many others were markedly narrowed, some of them shading off to a width
of less than 1/3000 of an inch, and finally disappearing altogether.They retained, however, even in their narrowest dimensions, their
transverse striae."(It may be remarked, in passing, that this substitution of fibrous for
muscular tissue follows the same law that it does in the heart when
that organ is the seat of fibrosis or fibrous degeneration.Here it was
supposed to be the consequence of a low grade of inflammatory action.In the abdomen these observers found nothing which suggested the
possibility of tubercles or any obscure form of cancer.In the
pericardium, on the heart side, were found numerous small nodular
roughnesses.Irregularities of the pericardial false membrane are so
common that nothing but the close and universal adhesions would raise
any question of these relations.But tubercles would hardly be here and
nowhere else.{1164} Delafield says that one form of the chronic disease is the
continuance of his cellular peritonitis.In this, he says, the surface
of the omentum is covered with cells which look as if they were derived
from the endothelium and connective-tissue cells, although they differ
from the normal shape of these.The new cells are for the most part
polygonal, of different size, with one or several nuclei, and
giant-cells--large granular masses filled with nuclei.Although these
new cells are produced over the entire surface of the peritoneum, yet,
as a rule, they are more numerous in little patches here and there.These little patches may be heaped together in such numbers as to form
nodules visible to the naked eye.There is never any stroma between
these cells.This form of peritonitis occurs most frequently with organic heart
disease, with cirrhosis of the liver, with chronic pulmonary phthisis,
and with acute general tuberculosis.In the two latter diseases he
thinks they have been improperly called tubercles.He describes a form of chronic adhesion of peritoneal surfaces that
occurs without the intervention of fibrin, but, as he supposes, by
coalescence of the branching cells and a production from them of a
fibrillated basement substance, the fibrils crossing in all directions.In the midst of these fibrils he finds the nuclei of these cells.He
finds also in the immediate neighborhood of these adhesions thousands
of branching cells that are attached one to another and float free in
the water, the fixed end being attached to the peritoneum.He regards
such a peritonitis with adhesions as a more advanced stage of the forms
of cellular peritonitis already described, and the new cells are
changed into membrane.Sayre has published an extraordinary case in the _Transactions of the
Pathological Society_.He calls it chronic proliferative peritonitis;
it might be called more aptly the consequence of peritonitis.A large, strong man fell from a hammock, the rope breaking, upon his
shoulders, and felt a severe pain in his stomach, and soon developed
symptoms of peritonitis.About one month after he was tapped, and
240 ounces of serum were drawn.He was tapped one hundred and
eighty-seven times, and 1203-5/16 pounds of fluid were taken from him
during the remainder of his life.The liver and spleen were covered by a
thick layer of false membrane, intestines were glued together in the
upper part of the abdomen, and the stomach was adherent to the lower
surface of the liver.The portal vein was contracted by this membranous
coating.There were numerous other lesions in the heart and pleura, but
these will account for the dropsy.This man was unusually strong and hearty until 1876, when he had an
attack of double pleuro-pneumonia, and in 1878 he slipped on the front
steps and fell, but seemed to recover from the effects of this.The
fall from the swing occurred in July, 1879.[10]

[Footnote 10: _Med.{1165} Tubercular Peritonitis.This form of disease is by no means uniform in its first symptoms or in
its progress.The only things uniformly attending it are tubercles on
the peritoneum and more or less of inflammatory effusion, chiefly lymph
and serum; tumor and hardness of the bowels, general or local; deranged
function of the stomach and intestines; emaciation; and extreme
fatality.In some cases the invasion is acute and marked--a chill followed by
fever, vomiting, early development of meteorism, and in a few days a
point or points of resistance to pressure, but not necessarily dulness
on percussion.In a few days the febrile action and the meteorism may
subside, leaving the symptoms of local peritonitis.But we have not
long to wait for a renewal of them and an evident extension of the
inflammatory action.Remission and relapse alternate at varying
intervals, until the whole extent of the peritoneal surface seems to be
involved in inflammation.With this mode of development meteorism may
not be renewed in the most common way.The lymphy product of
inflammation may so bind the intestines to the posterior walls of the
abdomen that they cannot extend forward, but are pushed upward against
the liver and diaphragm, and so encroach on the thoracic space.But
then the anterior parietes are tense and hard, and do not move in
respiration.The febrile heat may not continue more than two or three
months, but the pulse will be frequent to the end.There will be a
thinning of bowel walls, and here and there a knuckle of adherent
intestines may cause some prominence and give some resonance on
percussion.There will be also occasional vomiting, and the dejections
will be irregular--maybe only deficient or thin; there may be an
alternation of constipation and diarrhoea.Tuberculous ulcerations of the mucous layer of the bowels is not
uncommon in tubercular peritonitis, and these ulcers have in rare cases
perforated and allowed the fecal matter to accumulate in considerable
quantity in a sac limited by previous adhesions.In all forms of
tubercular peritonitis death is caused as often by grave complications
as by what appears to be the primary disease.The affection occurs in
probably every instance in those who had at the beginning, or had
acquired in its progress, what we call the tubercular diathesis.We are
not surprised, therefore, to find on inspection a wide diffusion of
tubercles in the body, particularly on other serous membranes, and in
the lungs.Death may occur, then, from phthisis pulmonalis or from
pleurisy or meningitis, as well as from the exhaustion and accidents of
the peritoneal disease.The effusion serum or turbid serum is very
common in tubercular peritonitis, and can be recognized by the dulness
it produces in part of the cavity, and sometimes by fluctuation.It is
often sacculated, but it is not constantly found after death, it having
been absorbed before, and perhaps long before, that event.In other cases the invasion of the disease is stealthy and deceiving.It comes so quietly that the patient is not conscious of any local
disorder beyond a dyspepsia and irregular action of the bowels.He has
a pulse of growing frequency, but if he knows it he ascribes it to his
dyspepsia.He is slowly losing flesh and strength; this he accounts for
in the same way.At length a perceptible swelling of the bowels
attracts his attention.At this stage the physician finds that the
swollen bowels are tympanitic everywhere or only in the upper, while
there is evidence of fluid {1166} effusion in the more depending,
parts.He discovers some, it may be little, tenderness on pressure, and
a pulse of 85, or maybe 90, increasing in frequency toward evening.The
appetite is poor, the digestion slow, and occasionally there is
vomiting; the complexion is pale and a little dingy; the skin of the
abdomen may be dry and rough or may be natural; some colicky pains have
been or soon will be felt.From this point the disease gradually
advances.The distension of the bowels slowly increases or they are
firmly retracted; the emaciation increases; the strength diminishes;
there is often cough, which is generally dry; the bowels are slow or
diarrhoea alternates with constipation; with the distended bowels there
is always more than natural resonance on percussion, except when there
is fluid effusion, though not often the full tympanitic sound observed
in acute diffuse peritonitis.This resonance is not equal, always, in
different parts of the abdomen; the respiration is embarrassed and
almost wholly thoracic.The abdomen is often as large as that of a
female at full term of pregnancy, and indeed the condition has been
mistaken for pregnancy.This is an inexcusable blunder in a case like
that which I have in mind--a young unmarried woman.She had no dulness
on percussion in the space that would be occupied by the gravid uterus,
but rather resonance.The case might have been a little less clear if
there had been fluid effusion in the abdominal cavity, but if this were
not encysted it would flow from one side of the abdomen to the other
when the patient turned correspondingly in bed; if it was encysted,
there would be small chances that it would have the shape and position
of the gravid uterus; if it had, there would be no chance of hearing in
it the foetal heart or feeling the foetal movements; and after all this
there remains the experimentum crucis--a vaginal examination.Some aid is found,
possibly, in the medical history of the family, in tuberculous
antecedents, yet I remember cases in which no phthisis could be found
in any living or dead member of the family on the paternal or maternal
side as far back as it could be traced.Some aid is found if the
patient himself has any of the physical or rational indications of
pulmonary phthisis, and yet there are recorded cases in which the
abdominal symptoms were the first to appear.The prominent German
physicians attach great importance to the pre-existence of a cheesy
mass or degeneration somewhere in the body as the real parent of
tubercles wherever they appear.The truth of this doctrine, I do not
think, has received anything like universal recognition; and if it had,
as this cheesy degeneration is often, perhaps commonly, only
discoverable after death, it could rarely give any assistance in
diagnosis, so that the early diagnosis is always difficult, and a very
early one often impossible.But as time goes on, and the symptoms are
better defined and show themselves one after another as they are above
described, it seems as if a careful observer could not confound it with
anything except perhaps one of the other forms of chronic peritonitis
or cancerous peritonitis.As to the latter, the cough which exists in
most cases of tubercular peritonitis will assist in the distinction,
but a physical examination much more; for a cough does not always
attend phthisis when this disease exists; for example, I visited a
daughter of one of the distinguished gentlemen of Vermont.She had had
the bowel symptoms that indicated tubercular peritonitis for eight or
ten months, and the diagnosis was not {1167} difficult.Remembering
Louis's opinion that if tubercles invade any other part of the body,
they are likely to be found at the same time in the lungs and in a more
advanced condition, I examined the lungs, and found in the upper part
of the right a cavity so large that it could have received a fist.I
was only surprised by the fact that she did not cough, and had not
coughed.She herself assured me of that (she was twenty-one years old);
her physician, who was present at the visit, had never heard her cough,
and had no suspicion of any pulmonary complication; but, more than all,
her mother, who had walked with her, slept with her, eaten with her,
travelled with her, and from the beginning of the illness had not been
out of her company more than twenty minutes in any twenty-four hours
since the disease began, had never heard her cough.Here, then, the
nervous deviation to the abdomen, or whatever else it may have been,
had so benumbed the sensibility of the pulmonary nerves that the
alarm-bell of phthisis had never been sounded; but the cavity, had
there been any doubt whether the bowel disease was cancerous or
tuberculous, would have almost fully settled the question.But more of
the peculiarities of cancerous peritonitis a little farther on.The lesions of this disease (or its pathological anatomy) differ
considerably, but the differences are in the amount of tuberculous
deposit and the secondary results, not in the real nature of the
disease.Lebert has published among his plates of pathological anatomy
one which shows the peritoneum thickly sprinkled over with small
tuberculous grains, and represents each particular grain surrounded by
a little zone of inflammatory injection.There is yet no exudation, but
that would soon follow.A fibrinous exudation will soon come over this
primary deposit, and undergo a kind of organization, or at least get
blood-vessels, which in their turn can furnish the material for a new
crop of tubercles.These again provoke a new layer of fibrous tissue,
which also becomes studded with tubercles, and so on, till a thick
covering is formed over the intestines.But the same material is
interposed between their folds, separating one from another and
compressing them and diminishing their calibre; at the same time this
agglomerated mass is firmly adherent to the abdominal walls everywhere.The new material may have a thickness of half an inch or even more.I
remember how surprised and confused I was when I made my first
inspection of such a case.The abdominal walls were cut through, but
they could not be lifted from the intestines, but were firmly adherent
to something.They were carefully dissected off and the bowel cavity
(?)exposed; there was apparently an immense tumor filling the whole
space: no intestines, no viscera, could be seen.A section was made
through this mass from above downward, and another parallel with it and
an inch distant from it, and this part removed.It appeared like a
large, hard tumor, through which the intestine made several
perforations.The new material appeared to be fibrous, with
grayish-white tubercles sprinkled in through it everywhere, and pretty
abundantly.In another case this fibro-tubercular material may occupy
one part of the abdomen, and a large serous cyst or serous cysts
another.The tuberculo-fibrous material may be found in markedly less
quantity than is so far described, till there will be no more than in a
case from Ziemssen's clinique, quoted by Bauer: "In the peritoneal
cavity about four liters of yellowish-brown, slightly turbid fluid.Omentum {1168} thickened, stretched, adherent to the anterior wall of
the abdomen and beset with hemorrhages; the same was true of the
parietal peritoneum; between the hemorrhages whitish-yellow and
entirely white tubercles occur, varying in size from the head of a pin
to a lentil.The
intestines intensely inflated; a number of ulcers on the mucous
membrane, one approaching perforation.Covering of the liver thickened
by fibrinous deposition."The lungs and serous membranes generally will, in all probability, show
more or less of tubercular deposit, the pericardium less frequently
than the others.The result in this affection, after it is fully established, is
believed to be uniformly fatal, and at its commencement the difficulty
of diagnosis may lead one to doubt whether his apparent success is
anything better than apparent.Still, a plan which I have relied on is,
I believe, worth announcing.As soon as the disease is recognized the
patient is put upon the use of the iodide of potassium and the iodide
of iron, in full average doses, and a solution of iodine in olive oil
is applied to the whole surface of the abdomen by such gentle friction
as will produce no pain; and after a minute or two of such friction the
oil is brushed thinly over the surface and the whole covered with oiled
silk.The quantity of iodine to
an ounce of oil will vary considerably in different persons; for some,
seven to ten grains will be enough; for others, thirty will be needed.The iron is to make the application moderately irritating, and if it
produce pinhead blisters or blisters a little larger, all the better.When the application becomes painful the oil is washed off, and the
application is not renewed for two or three days.In this manner it may
be continued for two or three months.Meantime, the patient is put upon
the diet and regimen of the consumptive, the appetite encouraged; he
takes sustaining food, with plenty of milk and cream, or cod-liver oil,
as much fresh air as possible, and friction is applied to other parts
of the body with dry flannel.Benign tumors of the abdomen are not frequently the cause of general
peritonitis, and when they are, the grade of the disease is acute
rather than chronic.They very often provoke local inflammation and
become adherent to the neighboring structures.The same is true of
malignant growths in the abdominal cavity, except that the adhesions
are earlier formed and more likely to occur.Localized cancer, of
whatever variety, is not very prone to produce general peritonitis,
even though there be multiple developments of it.But when the disease
takes the disseminated form, and is sprinkled over the whole extent of
the peritoneum, then inflammation is almost certain to occur--not of
high grade, and yet deserving the name subacute rather than chronic.A
case which illustrates this statement has come under my observation
within the last year.I will recite it with sufficient detail to make
it intelligible.A lady about forty years of age had, up to the summer of 1881, enjoyed
very good health, though she was never robust.At that time she felt
her strength abating and her stomach disordered.She sought {1169}
health in various places, and took professional advice in September.It
availed her little; the bowels were gradually swelling and fluctuation
could be felt.There was not a
cachectic countenance, but the features were growing sharp.She had
suffered but little from pain till October.At that time she was at the
family country home.Then she began to suffer from a severe pain in the
left thigh; and this, it was noticed, increased as the accumulation in
the bowels increased, and at length her physician felt compelled to tap
her--not so much on account of great distension of the bowel as in the
hope of relieving the pain.He drew off nine quarts of gluey, viscid
fluid, and her pain was wholly relieved.Twelve or fifteen days after
this she was brought to her city home, and her city physician, seeing
that her case was a grave one, sought the aid of a distinguished
gynaecologist.She was then again tapped to give him a more
satisfactory examination.He found the ovaries considerably enlarged
and hard.They could not, however, be felt by pressing the fingers into
the pelvis from above--only by the vagina.I saw her on the 10th of
November.The fluid had again made considerable tumefaction of the
bowels, and she was again suffering great pain in the region of the
right kidney and in the leg of the same side, together with cramps.The
relief given by the first tapping induced us to propose its repetition.It was, however, delayed till the 14th, that the physician who had
tapped her before might be present and assist.The quantity of water
drawn was again nine quarts, and again the pains and spasms were
quieted.It was
nearly clear, reddish, of syrupy flow and consistence, and so viscid
that while a portion of it had remained on the slide of the microscope
long enough for the examination of its constituents the thin cover
became so firmly attached to the slide that it could not be removed
without breaking or long maceration.The albumen was so abundant that
the fluid was completely consolidated on boiling.Fibrinous threads
were running through it in great numbers, and here and there was a cell
of large size, round, granular, but not plumped up with granules, with
a nucleus barely less in size than the cell itself; its outer border
within, but only just within, the boundary or wall of the cell.It was
the nucleus that was granular, for there was little room for granules
between the nucleus and the cell wall.The vial containing the fluid
had been standing three or four hours for a sediment.This in a vial
four inches high occupied the lower half, and gave nothing to the
dropping-tube till the sedimentary matter was drawn into it by suction.This matter consisted of fibrillated fibrin in large quantity; a great
number of the cells just described, some grouped, but most separate or
single.There were pus-cells in moderate quantity, each having the
amoeboid movements, and a considerable number of red blood-corpuscles,
some of natural form, some crenate.Immediately after the tapping the flaccid condition of the abdominal
walls admitted an examination.A solid, hard mass was found running
across the upper part of the bowels, a nodule of which was lying on the
stomach at the point of the ensiform cartilage.A harder mass of
irregular shape was also found just above the pelvis on the right side,
extending upward and to the right.This was in extent two by three
inches.The ovary, however, could not be detected by pressure from
above {1170} downward.The diagnosis up to this time was hardly
doubtful, but these revelations made it complete, and crushed any
lingering hope of the patient's recovery.While the pain and spasm ceased after the tapping, the oedema of the
left leg, which came on some time before the last tapping, did not
diminish.The hard spot near the right iliac fossa was tender on
pressure, but otherwise hardly painful.While the fluid did not exceed
six quarts or so, she had little pain anywhere.There were no external
glandular swellings.Her appetite was poor, and she took but little
food.She vomited very little till the end was approaching.The urine
contained a few globules of pus, some pigment matter, two or three
hyaline casts, but no trace of albumen.For sixteen days following
November 14th the patient was comfortable, but the fluid was slowly
filling the bowels again.At that time the pains already referred to
began to return.On December 5th they required another tapping, and
preparations were made for it, but vomiting, rather severe, led to its
postponement to the next day.The quantity of fluid drawn was nine and
a half quarts.It was of the same syrupy consistence as that previously
drawn, and under the microscope showed exactly the same constituents
and gave the same quantity of albumen.The next day stercoraceous
vomiting commenced, with no movement of the bowels, except what was
produced by 10 grains of calomel given on the second day of this
vomiting.She after
this took no food by the mouth, but milk and beef-tea were injected
into the rectum.Still, the fecal vomiting returned, and she died on
the 15th.The post-mortem examination was made on the 17th by William H. Welch.His report is complete as to the main features of
the case, though it does not furnish an explanation of the spasms and
the oedema of the left leg, regarding which Welch was not informed.The
pain and spasm were doubtless due to backward pressure of a diseased
part on a nerve or nerves, and the oedema to a narrowing of the iliac
vein by pressure or constriction by fibro-cancerous matter on its outer
sides."The peritoneal cavity," he says, "contained somewhat over a
gallon of clear, yellow serum.Both the visceral and parietal layers of
the peritoneum were thickened, in some places more than in others; this
was especially marked on the anterior of the stomach and on the lower
part of the ileum and in the left iliac region.The omentum was greatly
thickened and retracted into a firm mass (or roll), which extended
somewhat obliquely across the body, more to the left than to the right.The mesentery was much thickened and contracted, drawing the intestines
backward.In a few places only was the peritoneal surface coated with
fibrin, and the intestines were mostly free from adhesions.The coils
of the lower part of the ileum, however, were firmly matted together by
organized connective tissue in such a way that they were twisted, often
at a sharp angle, so as greatly to constrict the calibre of the gut.The serous and muscular layers of the intestine at this point were
greatly thickened.By these causes there appeared to be a complete
obstruction at a point about six inches above the ileo-caecal valve.By
careful dissection these coils were straightened out, so as to remove
the main cause of obstruction.The peritoneal covering of the liver was
adherent to the parietal layer.{1171} "The surface of both the visceral and parietal peritoneum was
studded over with hundreds of small, firm, whitish nodules, generally
not larger than a pea, and often not larger than a pin's head.In some
places they had coalesced and made firm patches an inch in extent.This
same material was found in the contracted omentum in considerable
quantity.In a few places, particularly on the uterus, a blackish
pigmented deposit appeared."The ovaries were not adherent, but both were enlarged to the size of a
hen's egg.The outer surface of each was rough and corrugated.The new
growth was deposited on the exterior and penetrated each a quarter to
half an inch.It was of uniform white color and of firm consistence."The stomach wall was thickened nearly throughout its extent, but
particularly in the anterior part, where it amounted to thrice the
normal thickness.This consisted wholly of hypertrophy of the muscular
coat and increase of fibrous tissue in the peritoneal layer.This new
growth was traced, in the interlacing bands, from the surface into the
muscular coat.In the outer layer of the stomach were found three small
white nodules.The mucous membrane of the organ was healthy or a little
pale."The retro-peritoneal glands along the aorta were enlarged, soft, and
of a reddish-gray color.A nodule was found in the wall of the duodenum
outside the mucous membrane, and one in the Fallopian tube."Every organ in the abdomen and chest was examined, but nothing
important found except what is here recorded.Welch concludes his
record with the following diagnosis: "Primary scirrhous carcinoma of
the ovaries.Secondary deposits in the peritoneum, in the outer layer
of the right Fallopian tube, of the stomach and duodenum, and in the
retro-peritoneal glands.This case presents to the reader so accurately the usual course of
cancerous peritonitis, and the inspection its lesions, that a treatise
on the subject is hardly called for.It often happens that cancerous
antecedents in the patient or his relatives will lend an aid to the
diagnosis, which this case did not present.To distinguish this disease
from tubercular peritonitis no question can arise except in its
dropsical form, and then the lungs in every case of the latter that I
have met with have the physical signs of tubercles, though not always
the rational indications.The pulse is much more accelerated in the
tuberculous variety.I omitted to state that the temperature of this
patient was often taken, and till the closing scene was never found
more than one or two degrees above the healthy standard, and the
morning and evening heat did not materially vary; the opposite of both,
then, would be expected in a tuberculous case.The existence of
meteorism is much more common in the tubercular disease; indeed, in the
cancerous case recited there was none of it.The duration of the two is
different--that of the cancerous kind is recorded in months, while the
tuberculous variety may continue two years.The cancerous is more
likely to be attended by alarming accidents, like the complete
obstruction of the bowels, large hemorrhages, and a sudden lighting up
of acute peritonitis.Finally, in the light of the case here recorded,
it seems probable that the examination of the abdominal fluid will
become of great importance.I have never carefully examined the fluid
of tubercular dropsy, but it does not seem probable that it will have
the syrupy {1172} appearance, the large amount of albumen, the
abundance of fibrin-fibres, and the granular large cells with nuclei
only perceptibly less in size than the cells themselves, that were
repeatedly found in this case--found by two observers, and at every
tapping after the first.TREATMENT cannot be curative; it therefore consists of such
administrations as will relieve pain, give sleep, improve the appetite,
increase the flow of urine if it be scanty, and relieve the bowels if
there is a tendency to constipation.It is as much the duty of the
physician to put off the fatal day, when he can, in incurable
affections as it is to cure those that will yield to his prescription
and advice.In the case just narrated opium or an opiate alone produced
such unpleasant after-effects that she was unwilling to take it, but
when the extract of belladonna was given with it she slept pleasantly,
and could take her food the next day.Infantile Peritonitis, or Peritonitis of Childhood.Bauer, in _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia of Practice of Medicine_, and
Wardell, in _Reynolds's System of Medicine_, have each devoted a
chapter to this form of disease.They refer to the fact that the foetus
may have peritonitis before birth or be born with it, or may have it
when a few days old.They say that this form of the disease occurs most
frequently in lying-in asylums or foundling hospitals, and that it has
been supposed to depend on a syphilitic taint.They say, too, that it
follows erysipelas, scarlet fever, measles, etc.I do not perceive that
the description of either of these authors makes any marked distinction
between this and the same disease in adults, except what may arise from
the inability of the infant to describe its sensations, and the more
rapid course of the disease to a fatal result--in some cases
twenty-four hours.Having myself had no obstetrical practice, or next
to none, I have nothing to add to their statements, and can from my own
knowledge abate nothing.I therefore refer the reader to these
chapters, and to the references given by the first of these authors,
for a fuller knowledge of the matter.Regarding the comparative exemption of children, after the first few
weeks of life, from spontaneous peritonitis, referred to by one of
these authors, I can fully confirm his statement.Though I have
assisted in the treatment of many children suffering from peritonitis,
I have difficulty in recalling to mind a single case in which the
disease was not caused by perforation of the intestine or vermiform
appendix of the caecum, and in much the greatest frequency perforation
of the appendix.B. F. Dawson,[11] after reciting a case in which the liver had
undergone a peculiar degeneration and was attended by peritonitis
before birth, states that Sir J. Y. Simpson observed nine cases in his
own practice "and notes more than a dozen from different sources."These cases seemed to have been caused by the ill-health of the mother
during gestation, or excessive labor, injuries, venereal disease, and
were mostly attended by grave disease; the viscera often, the liver;
but sometimes the mother was perfectly healthy, and the peritonitis was
the primary disease.Death almost always occurred in utero or shortly
after birth.Record_ takes the following from _Schmidt's
Jahrbucher_ for Jan.Oscar Silbermann recognizes two
varieties of peritonitis in the new-born.The non-septic or chronic is
developed usually in the first third of foetal life, and is generally
syphilitic in origin.If the peritoneum covering the intestines be
involved, as well as that over the liver and spleen, various forms of
intestinal obstruction may result.Most frequently there is occlusion
of the anus, less often stenosis or complete stricture of the small
intestine.Of a number of cases of congenital occlusion of the
intestine collected by the author, all ended fatally, only one living
beyond twelve days."The second, acute or septic, form of peritonitis in the new-born the
author divides into two varieties, according as the peritonitis is only
a part of general infection or is the sole manifestation of the septic
poison.In either case the point of entrance of the poison is always
the navel wound.The symptoms, which need not all be present in a given
case, are vomiting, watery stools, meteorism, ascites, abdominal
tenderness, icterus, etc.The pulse and temperature may vary in degree
in different cases.A cure of the septic form is possible; therefore
the treatment should be carefully considered.The navel wound should be
cleansed, and the child is to be isolated from its mother.To control
the fever quinine may be given.Priessnitz's sheet is of value;
vomiting may be checked by chloral (one-half to one grain in water).The strength should of course be maintained by stimulants if
necessary."The accumulation of fluid indicated by this name has already been
referred to in its relations to several causes.There are, however,
conditions producing it which have not been considered or only
considered partially.The most prolific source of abdominal dropsy is obstruction of the
portal circulation on its way to or through the liver.Condensation of
the liver structure in cirrhosis, with destruction of many of the
portal capillaries and compression of many more, is prominent in this
connection.The compression of the liver caused by an adventitious
external covering, referred to under the head of Local Peritonitis,
acts similarly, whether it compresses the vein at its entrance into the
liver or not, although it is not known to produce any destruction of
the portal capillaries.Some enlargements of the organ are attended by
the same result, but they are always associated with a hardening of its
structure.The disease lately called waxy liver, now often denominated
lardaceous, belongs to this class, as does that condition in which the
organ is enlarged, hardened, and fissured, regarded as syphilitic
liver.That both these diseases may have a syphilitic and mercurial
origin is not a point now under consideration.They both harden the
hepatic structure and obstruct the portal circulation, while they may
not in equal degree hinder the progress of arterial blood.This is
explained when we remember the diminished force that propels the portal
blood.Neither of these diseases produces dropsy early in its progress,
but, as I have seen it, always before it reaches its fatal termination.Fatty liver has not, in my observation, produced dropsy, {1174}
although I have seen livers made very large by that disease, and the
absence of dropsy when the liver has been large has aided me in
distinguishing it from the waxy disease.Cancer of the liver in some
instances does, and in others does not, produce dropsy of the bowels.It is only certain to have this result when a tumor is in position to
press upon and obstruct the portal.Hypertrophy of the liver, caused by
mitral regurgitation or other disease of the heart, does not generally
produce dropsy, but, aided by anaemia or watery condition of the blood,
such a result is possible.In children, however, it is not very rare to
see the bowels distended by dropsy, and to discover that the liver is
enlarged at the same time.It is common in such cases that the dropsy
and the hypertrophy disappear after a few weeks of treatment.This may
occur in a child that is anaemic, but without any disease of the heart.Such a case was brought to me two or three months ago, and after four
weeks of treatment by tonics and diuretics the health was
re-established.There is one point in these cases of some importance.When the child lies on his back, if the abdomen is much distended, the
liver cannot be felt.It has sunk away into the fluid, and in this
position ordinary percussion cannot ascertain its dimensions.In the
July number (1840) of a quarterly journal edited by Swett and Watson, I
published an article in which I reported the conjoined labors of the
late Camman and myself on a new method of combining auscultation and
percussion, with its results, under the heading "Auscultatory
Percussion."By the method described in that article--viz.by placing a
solid stethoscope, or for that Laennec's first stethoscope, a rolled-up
pamphlet, on the chest at a point where the liver has not fallen away
from its walls, and percussing on the abdomen from below upward--a
point is reached whence the percussion sound is brought sharply to the
ear, while half an inch below the sound is dull and distant.The lower
edge of the liver is thus easily recognized, and its upper boundary is
found in a similar manner or by ordinary percussion, so the difficulty
of measurement disappears.In such case, when the dropsy disappears and the liver recovers its
natural dimensions at the same time, the inference is that the
hypertrophy caused the dropsy, and that the hypertrophy was of the kind
called simple.The nutmeg liver is thought to have an agency in
producing dropsy, but as it is for the most part associated with
diseases that have been called dropsy-producing, its bearing on this
effusion may yet be regarded as uncertain.It is common to speak of heart dropsy in such a way as to imply that
disease of the heart alone can produce abdominal effusion.I even doubt whether the heart alone can cause the anasarca that is so
often attributed to it.In following a great multitude of heart
diseases from the time they were recognized to their termination, I
have been struck with the ease with which the patients attend to their
business, sometimes even laborious business, for years--in one instance
fifty years--with almost no complaint, and how rapidly their condition
changes as soon as albumen and casts appear in the urine.I have been
compelled by these observations to ascribe the anasarca and oedema that
makes this last stage of heart disease so distressing to the kidneys,
and not to the heart.Double pleuritic effusion is not uncommon under
these circumstances, but every physician must have noticed the rareness
of troublesome abdominal {1175} dropsy, while there is
sometimes--perhaps often--a little effusion; and when in the
exceptional cases there has been much, it was almost always accounted
for by a dropsy-producing change in the abdominal organs, not, perhaps,
discovered during life; so that for me, while they produce overwhelming
effusions in other parts of the system, they are minor agents in the
production of ascites.Phthisis is occasionally attended, toward its
close, by oedematous legs and albuminous urine, but I cannot report any
important relation between these and peritoneal effusion.I can say the
same of chronic bronchitis.I record this negative testimony regarding
the two last-named diseases, because I find them enumerated among the
causes of abdominal dropsy.Cancer may invade the portal vein, tumors of adjacent parts other than
those of the liver, or an aneurism may compress it and cause dropsy.Diseases of the pelvic organs, both acute
and chronic, may produce it, but then the disease would fall into the
class of those produced by chronic or subacute peritonitis.DaCosta thinks he has lately had a case of chronic peritonitis attended
by ascites.It was in a woman thirty years of age, who had been thrown
with force upon the frame of an iron bedstead, striking the lower part
of the bowels.These were not confined to
the injured part, but extended to the whole abdomen; and there was
menorrhagia.After a time there was fluid effusion in the peritoneal
cavity, which slowly increased till her state demanded relief from
tapping.The pain and
tenderness were constant symptoms all through.She slowly improved, and
at the time the case was reported it was believed that she would soon
be discharged from the hospital.The only doubt which DaCosta finds
regarding the diagnosis is in the facts that the liver was diminished
in size and that the spleen was moderately enlarged, and he admits the
possibility that an adventitious capsule of the liver may have caused
the ascites, but believes that it was dependent on chronic peritonitis.Acute peritonitis subsiding into chronic, with increase of fluid
effusion, as I have already said, I am not familiar with.That
occurring in cancerous and tuberculous peritonitis has already been
considered.But in relation to these some facts regarding frequency of
occurrence, collected by Bristowe, are worth quoting.He says that in
48 cases of tubercular peritonitis, dropsy was found in 12, and that in
22 of peritoneal cancer, 12 had more or less ascites.He further adds,
regarding cirrhosis, that of 46 cases observed post-mortem, there was
dropsy in only 20.This is not surprising, as in all the diseased
conditions of the liver that produce dropsy the anatomical changes must
reach the point at which there is considerable portal obstruction
before the effusion will occur.The amount of fluid found in ascites varies greatly.In some it may
remain for a long time stationary at four or five quarts; in others the
suffering caused by an accumulation of nine or ten quarts will demand
its removal; and in a few cases twenty quarts have been removed in one
operation.It is in cirrhosis that the largest quantity is found, and
it is in this disease and in cancerous peritonitis that the most
frequent tappings are required.The quality of the fluid also varies
markedly: from being almost as clear and thin as spring-water it may be
almost ropy, or in color greenish or yellowish or slightly red; it is
very likely to contain {1176} albumen; and it is probable that a
further study of its microscopic elements may enable us to resolve
doubts regarding the cause of the effusion.It very often contains
blood-corpuscles.Bristowe finds from hospital records that ascites occurs in about equal
frequency in males and females, but, as everybody has noticed, that
hepatic dropsy is much more frequent in men than in women.Ascites, he
says, is most frequent between the ages of thirty and fifty, and next
between twenty and thirty and between fifty and sixty, but is not
uncommon above the latter age; and it occurs in children.SYMPTOMS.--In general, ascites is easily recognized by the swollen
state of the bowels: a well-rounded swelling when the patient stands or
sits, but spread out in the flanks when he lies on his back; the
fulness of the side on which the patient may be lying, and the
flattened condition of the opposite side,--belong to this disease, and
as a group to no other.The results of percussion are significant in
the movement it causes in the fluid, and for the resonance or flatness
it produces.When the patient lies on his back, tapping with the
finger-ends on one side of the abdomen sends a wave of the fluid across
to the other side, where it is perceived as a gentle blow by the
applied fingers of the other hand.If the abdomen is not full, this
wave will be produced at the upper level of the fluid, but not above
that.If this wave cannot be sent across the body, it may be found on
either side by percussing above and feeling for it below; percussion
also teaches where the fluid is, and where it is not, by the dull sound
it produces.It is rare in ascites that the intestines do not float on
the surface of the fluid, at least from the umbilicus upward, and there
give a loud percussion sound, while toward the back, and often toward
the pelvis, it is dull, or even flat; changing the position of the
body, the resonance will be uppermost and the dulness in the most
dependent part.Then the softness or impressibility of the abdomen till
the tension becomes great is noticeable.The changed position of the
fluid as the body is turned from side to side is important.A very
small quantity of fluid can be detected in this manner.The patient is
placed on his right side and percussion is made in the right flank:
there is dulness, while in the left flank there is resonance.The
patient turns on to the left side: dulness now changes position, and is
on the left, and on the right resonance.If it is feared that some
undetected fluid remains in the pelvic cavity, the pelvis may be raised
by pillows and the same examination repeated, or he may be placed in
the knee-and-elbow position referred to by Bristowe, and the percussion
will then be made upward in the umbilical region.In some cases the
contraction of the mesentery will not allow the intestines to rise
through a large amount of fluid and float on it; but such cases are
almost confined to the cancerous and the tuberculous varieties of the
disease; and as in these the symptoms are grave, the physician will
probably have visited his patient many times before this contraction
will embarrass him.Besides, when mesenteric contraction occurs there
is a very strong probability that the omentum will also be contracted,
be rolled up, and lumpy; as this can almost always be felt above the
level of the umbilicus, he has in it an explanation of the absence of
resonance on the fluid.It has happened that oedema of the abdominal
walls or fatty accumulations there have given a delusive though feeble
fluctuation on percussion.In such cases, if the patient make moderate
pressure with the back of a small book in {1177} the course of the
median line, that kind of wave will be broken, while a wave in the
abdominal cavity will not be prevented.When there is considerable
distension of the abdomen by fluid, weak spots in the abdominal wall
often yield and make a tumor.This is very common at the umbilicus,
where a little bladder is lifted half an inch or more above the general
curve of the abdomen.The fluid frequently follows the track of
hernias.In females it has been known to press the anterior wall of the
vagina backward and downward, so as to make it protrude at the vulva.It has, in one of my own cases, by downward pressure caused complete
prolapse of the uterus.It is very often attended by oedema of the
lower limbs.This is accounted for by the pressure of the abdominal
fluid on the veins that return the blood from these parts, or in
cirrhosis by contraction of the ring or notch through which the vena
cava passes in the liver.If there is general oedema, the cause will
probably be found in disease of the kidneys; or if in one limb, in
pressure or thrombosis of one iliac vein.As the disease advances the
accumulating fluid forces the diaphragm upward, diminishes the
breathing room, and threatens the life still more.Then the patient
cannot lie down in bed, but spends his nights as well as days in an
easy-chair, and sleeps leaning forward on a support for his forehead.The veins on the abdominal surface will fix attention.With almost any
large tumor in the cavity they become more or less enlarged.But in
cirrhotic dropsy this becomes more striking than in any other
affection.The enlargement is attended by a reversion of the
blood-current on the lower half of the abdomen.This is early shown by
emptying an inch or two of a vein with the finger, drawing it either
upward or downward, and noticing from which direction it is refilled
when the pressure is removed.The pelvic veins do not readily discharge
their blood by the natural channels, and by anastomosing branches it is
forced over the surface of the abdomen and into the thoracic veins,
these latter becoming in turn greatly enlarged.The appetite is
commonly poor, the digestion flatulent, the pulse accelerated.The urine is commonly scanty, and in
cirrhosis of a reddish hue.The skin is apt to be dry, particularly so
in simple chronic peritonitis.The tongue has no characteristic fur,
and is often, almost always toward the close, dry.The mind is not
affected till near the end; then often the patient is delirious,
commonly mildly.Diarrhoea is not uncommon, and even dysentery has been
observed.The result is almost always unfavorable, or, as has been
said, lethal.When, as in chronic peritonitis
and in tuberculous peritonitis, the fluid is confined in a sac or sacs,
each particular pool will be yielding to pressure, but elastic, and
will give the percussion wave, though it may extend but a short
distance.To distinguish ovarian dropsy--ovarian cysts, as it is now
called--from ascites may require a few words.Ovarian tumors of all
kinds are found to be more prominent on one side when they rise from
the pelvis than on the other.The
uterus and its appendages lie in front of the pelvic intestine, and
when any of them ascend above the pelvis they must occupy the same
relative position.In other words, a large ovarian cyst must lie in
front of the intestines, while intestinal resonance should be found
behind and in the sides.But if the ovarian cyst does not occupy the
whole height of the bowels, intestinal resonance {1178} may exist above
it, and the dulness may be found below, bounded by a portion of a
circle, and sometimes the cyst walls are resisting enough to allow its
boundaries to be ascertained by the fingers.This cyst can also be felt
in the vagina; and the uterus, instead of being pressed down, is
sometimes lifted upward, so that it cannot be reached in the vagina,
but can be felt through the abdominal walls just above the pelvic
bones.A condition more troublesome than this is when ovarian cyst and
ascites occur together.Then the posterior or lateral resonance is lost
when the patient lies on her back, but can be found on one side when
she lies on the other.In that concurrence, in dorsal decubitus it is
possible by pressure or a little blow to send a wave of the ascitic
fluid over the front of the cyst.Should the patient take the knee-and-elbow position, the intestinal
resonance may be restored in both flanks.TREATMENT.--In opening the chapter on the treatment of ascites it is
usually said, Give principal consideration to the diseased conditions
that have caused the dropsy; in other words, cure cirrhosis, cancerous
peritonitis, tubercular peritonitis, heart disease, and the secondary
affections of the abdominal organs, release the liver from the
dangerous compression to which it is subjected, and all will go well.But they do not inform us how these impossibilities--at least in most
cases impossibilities--are to be achieved.It is true that the
physician would not shrink hopelessly from the treatment of simple
chronic peritonitis.But this is one of the rarest causes of ascites.A
physician in a long lifetime may not have seen a case.It is true,
ascites is a symptom, always a secondary, or even a tertiary,
affection; and theoretically there can be no better advice, but
practically it cannot amount to much.Then, if the cause cannot be
removed, it remains to do our best to relieve the patient of his load
and strive to prolong his life to its utmost possible limit.In doing
this the physician will often find himself able to give gratifying
relief, and once in a great while to rejoice in a cure.The three great emunctories, the skin, the bowels, and the kidneys, are
chiefly appealed to for relief in this as in other serous
accumulations.Most physicians prefer to use the diuretics--first,
because if they will act at all, they act so quietly and produce so
little debility that whatever can be gained by them is obtained at
small cost to the system.The form of ascites that most resists
diuretics is that which originates in cirrhosis.Often a full trial of
them, with suitable changes from time to time, is of no avail, yet now
and then the kidneys yield to persuasion and act freely.The saline
diuretics and digitalis are most in favor with some.In the early part
of the present century a pill composed of squill and digitalis in
powder, and calomel, each one grain, given three times a day, was
almost universally chosen.In place of the calomel the blue mass was
often preferred.When this prescription had produced a little ptyalism
the mercurial was omitted and the squill and digitalis continued.It
has often been observed in dropsies of all kinds that diuretics act
better after a little mercurial action is set up in the system.The
diuretic that I most frequently prescribe is made of the carbonate of
potass.ounce ss and water ounce vj; to a tablespoonful of this a
tablespoonful of fresh lemon-juice is added.This is taken every two
hours, and at the same time a dessertspoonful of the infusion of
digitalis or more is taken three times a day.This is an {1179} old
prescription.Sometimes the old sal diureticus is used.It is not always kindly received by the stomach.At Bellevue Hospital the following is much used: viz.infusion of
digitalis, ounce iv; bitartrate of potash, ounce j; simple syrup, ounce
ss; and water added to make a pint.But it
would require many pages to exhaust the diuretics.I will only add that
I have more confidence in the salts of potash and soda, singly or
combined, aided by digitalis and a mercurial, than in any others.The diaphoretics that are most efficient are warm water and steam.A
foot-bath long continued and frequently repeated, the patient covered
with blankets, and the water kept at 90 degrees or warmer, are very
effectual in producing perspiration.Bricks heated or hot water in
bottles, or potatoes heated, and enveloped in damp cloths and laid
alongside of the body and limbs, form an extemporaneous vapor-bath of
considerable efficiency.A vapor-bath can be easily extemporized in the
following way: Have a kitchen vessel furnished by the tinman with a
cover which has an inch tube fitted to this and bent so as reach the
floor six feet from the fire.The pot should have a capacity of a
gallon or more, and should be kept boiling briskly.Meantime, the
patient, in his night-dress, has a double blanket brought over his
shoulders from behind, and another from before, and fastened.Now he
takes a chair (wooden), under which the steam is delivered.The blanket
from behind is kept off his body by the back of the chair, and the
front one by his knees.The steam, shut in in this way, soon brings on
a sweat, and when it is sufficiently active the front blanket is thrown
off, and the patient wrapped in the rear one and put to bed, when the
sweating can be regulated by blankets.This is better than what is
called the alcohol sweat, for in that the patient is bathed in carbonic
acid gas as well as heat.A patient is sometimes enveloped in a hot,
wet blanket with good effect.Pilocarpine has come into use lately as a
sudorific.I have witnessed its effects many times and can testify to
its certainty as a sudorific; but it is too debilitating for common
use.Digitalis has sometimes acted with extraordinary power in this
way, but there are grave risks in administering large doses.Among the cathartics that may be used in ascites, it has seemed to me
that the milder hydragogues are safest.One ounce of Epsom salts with a
drachm of the fluid extract of senna can be taken every second or third
day for months, if need be, with little reduction of strength, and
sometimes with an increase of it.I had charge of a young man in the
hospital in whom cirrhosis was unquestionable, and dropsy at one time
extreme, in whom the abdominal veins had made furrows that would
receive the little finger, who was wholly relieved by a drastic dose of
elaterium every second day.I saw him three years after his discharge,
and then his health was good.Notwithstanding this, I prefer the milder
medicines.Bristowe has seen no cures from either sudorifics, diuretics, or
purgatives.I have seen one or more from each of those agents, all
cirrhotic.He "has seen cures occasionally from mercury, iodide and
bromide of potash, copaiba, and a combination of fresh squills and
crude mercury."I agree with him in his statement that
counter-irritants are useless, making exception for chronic peritonitis
and the early stage of the tubercular variety.He thinks quinia, iron,
and cod-liver oil are useful.{1180} Paracentesis in almost every case will at length become
necessary, and the question comes whether it should be practised early
or late.If it be delayed till the oppression of the breathing makes it
imperative, the walls of the abdomen will be so stretched as to present
little resistance to the reaccumulation of the fluid, and a second
tapping will be required in fifteen to twenty-five days.A bandage is a
poor substitute for muscular contraction.If, on the other hand, the
fluid is withdrawn before the muscularity is not stretched out of the
muscles, then accumulation will be less rapid and the patient will be
spared the suffering which large accumulations cause.But tapping is
not always an innocent operation.It is sometimes followed by acute
peritonitis.By the early tapping this risk is oftener taken.Reginald
Smith suggests the use of a small canula by which only ten or twenty
ounces of the fluid can escape each hour.This mode, he thinks, removes
the danger of syncope and makes the bandage needless.Hemorrhagic Effusion

in the peritoneum is a topic on which there is little to be said.A
primary effusion of this kind probably does not occur.In
haematophilia, where the mucous membrane of the nose and wounds bleed
dangerously, there is no record of spontaneous bleeding into the
peritoneal cavity.The same thing can be said of that very rare disease
which has been called bloody sweat.An unmarried lady applied to me
fifteen years ago with this disorder.The blood would ooze out at
hundreds of points on the inner face of the arm; these would run
together and drop off the arm, or the same thing would occur on the
chest and in the bend of the knee.This would continue for two or three
minutes, and then cease of itself, but to recur in one or more, rarely
several, places.There was no
irregularity of the menses.I could find no visceral disease; there was
no nose-bleed.This kind of
bleeding continued for several years.She is now approaching fifty
years of age, and for the last two or three years has had no recurrence
of the bleeding.There was never anything in this case to lead to the
suspicion of peritoneal or other serous hemorrhage.In the few similar
cases on record there is the same absence of all evidence of internal
bleeding.It has already been said that a certain amount of blood, as shown by
its corpuscles, is to be expected in cancerous ascites, and with less
uniformity in tubercular ascites, and not unfrequently in hepatic
dropsy, as well as in acute peritonitis.This may not deserve to be
called hemorrhage, on account of the moderate quantity of blood that is
effused; but aside from that which results from rupture of
blood-vessels it is about the only kind of it with which we are
familiar.Scurvy, and conditions of the blood analogous to those produced by that
disease, make it almost certain that if pleurisy or pericarditis occurs
while these conditions exist, it will be hemorrhagic.I am not,
personally, acquainted with a single instance in which peritonitis in
this condition has occurred.Copeland, however, says that hemorrhage in
peritonitis has been noticed by Broussais and others.The blood is
mixed {1181} with the serum and stains the surface of the false
membrane, as in hemorrhagic pleurisy and pericarditis, and the disease
is of an asthenic type, "occurring in the hemorrhagic diathesis.""The
symptoms are inflammatory from the beginning, and rapidly pass into
those indicating great depression; the pulse becomes rapid, small, and
soft, death quickly supervening, with convulsions, cold and damp
extremities and surface," etc.Copeland has himself not seen a case, and regards its occurrence as
very rare.Delafield states that "Friedreich describes two cases
occurring in patients with ascites who had been frequently tapped.He
says that both the parietal and visceral peritoneum was covered with a
continuous membrane of a diffuse, yellowish-brown color, mottled with
small and large extravasations of blood.The membrane was thickest over
the anterior abdominal wall.It could be separated into a number of
layers.These layers were composed of blood-vessels, masses of pigment,
branching cells, and fibrillated basement substance.In many places the
extravasated blood was coagulated in the shape of round, hard, black
nodules.The new membrane could be readily stripped off from the
peritoneum, and there were no adhesions between the visceral and
parietal portions of the peritoneum."The erosions of abdominal cancer sometimes open vessels of considerable
size, causing large hemorrhage into this cavity and sudden death.When aneurisms of the abdominal aorta rupture, they sometimes flood the
abdominal cavity; oftener they open into the structures under the
peritoneum on the left side, and make a large flat tumor extending from
the point of rupture downward to the brim of the pelvis, and even
beyond it.A gentleman whose health was usually good, thirty-five years of age,
felt an unwonted exhaustion and feebleness creeping over him.His
countenance became pale, his pulse rapid, growing smaller and smaller.It seemed certain that there was hemorrhage somewhere, but until it was
noticed that the bowels were growing tumid and hard there was nothing
to guide us to its seat.Even then we were left to conjecture regarding
the bleeding vessel.After
death it was found that a small aneurism had been formed on one of the
vessels of the omentum, not larger than a small walnut, and had
ruptured by a very small opening, and that it was by this small opening
that life had oozed away.Bleedings from stabs and other wounds of the bowels, from lacerations
of the liver, spleen, uterus, and sometimes of the kidneys, should be
mentioned in this connection; but as they, for the most part, fall into
the hands of the surgeons, this is not the place to give the details
regarding them.{1182}

DISEASES OF THE ABDOMINAL GLANDS (TABES MESENTERICA).BY SAMUEL C. BUSEY, M.D.DEFINITION.--Tabes mesenterica may be briefly defined to be
tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands.This definition may seem too
limited, because it recognizes the identity of tuberculosis and
scrofulosis of the lymph-glands, and excludes those hyperplastic
conditions which do not certainly undergo the cheesy degeneration.It
is supported, however, by the absence of any essential difference in
the histological changes which take place in tuberculous and scrofulous
(Wagner) lymph-glands; by the frequent simultaneous occurrence of each
in the same subject; by the secondary development of tubercles during
the course of scrofulous affections; and by the fact that the cheesy
transformation is alike common to both these conditions of new
formations.Schuppel maintains that the presence of tubercles is
necessary to the production of the cheesy metamorphosis of
lymph-glands, and that "scrofulous glands are always tuberculous
glands."In this view Rindfleisch coincides, and expresses the belief
that the inflammatory and hyperplastic changes are secondary to the
formation of the tubercles.Birch-Hirschfeld asserts that cheesy
degeneration of the mesenteric glands is always accompanied by
tubercular formations.This definition is therefore adopted as the expression of the result of
the most recent investigations.It must, nevertheless, be admitted that
a few equally competent observers deny the identity of the tuberculous
and scrofulous new formations in lymph-glands.It must also be conceded
that occasionally hyperplastic processes in the lymph-glands undergo
the cheesy metamorphosis independent of tubercular development.SYNONYMS.--The differences of opinion, especially among the older
authors, in regard to the nature of this disease are very distinctly
indicated in the varying significance of the numerous synonyms, of
which the following list is only a part: Atrophia mesenterica; Atrophia
infantum (Hoffmann); Febris hectica infantum (Sydenham); Scrofula
mesenterica (Sauvages); Paralysma mesentericum (Good); Physconia
mesenterica (Baumes); Mesenteritis chronica (Stewart); Mesenteric
fever, Hectic fever, Marasmus (Underwood); Carreau, Entero-mesenterite
of the French; Darrsucht der Kinder and Gekroschwindsucht of the
Germans; Tubercles of the mesentery; Tuberculous disease of the
abdomen; Phthisis mesenterica; Tabes glandularis; Tabes scrofulosa;
Macies infantum; Paedatrophia; and Rachialgia mesenterica.{1183} Some of these synonyms indicate the theoretical and unsupported
opinions of their authors, and others refer merely to a symptom.The
name carreau refers to a hardness of the abdomen; physconia, to the
presence of a non-fluctuating and non-sonorous abdominal tumor; and
that of entero-mesenterite presupposes a secondary origin from a
primary enteritis.Good classes it among his numerous varieties of
mesenteric turgescence, but characterizes this special form as a
scrofulous turgescence always associated with the strumous diathesis.The terms tabes and atrophy originated when the nomenclature of disease
was derived from symptoms, and not from pathology.HISTORY AND PATHOLOGY.--The history of tabes mesenterica is coeval with
that of scrofula and pulmonary consumption.The ancient authors
recognized the existence of a chronic disease of the mesenteric glands,
characterized by enlargement and induration, followed by destruction of
the gland-parenchyma, which was associated with digestive disturbances,
emaciation, hectic fever, and usually terminated in death.At first,
the degenerative process was regarded as suppurative.But as the study
of scrofula progressed, and frequent observations were made of the
occurrence of disease of the external lymphatics and of the mesenteric
glands in the same subject, disputes arose as to the identity of the
two affections.These controversies led to the general acceptance of
the belief that the scrofulous degeneration of lymph-glands and the
process of destruction in tabes mesenterica were identical.Consentaneous with these investigations, and for a long time
subsequent, even down to a very late period, which is, perhaps, not yet
concluded, the relation of scrofulous disease of the lymph-glands to
pulmonary consumption was discussed and studied with great assiduity.As the knowledge concerning these diseases advanced, and the results of
investigations were accepted, the doctrine of the identity of the
morbid processes in scrofulous disease of the external glands and
mesenteric phthisis became firmly established.The history of
scrofulosis and tuberculosis cannot be separated.The connection and
identification of the two processes have been subjects of constant
discussion from the discovery of tubercle to the present time.Occasionally, the dividing-line seemed definitely fixed.Then would
follow the general acceptance of the doctrine of identity.With the
discovery of miliary tubercle a determined reaction took place against
this view, and for a while many regarded scrofulosis merely as a form
or stage of tuberculosis.As the conclusions in regard to these
questions changed, so did the opinions concerning the true nature of
tabes mesenterica change, until, finally, the investigations of
Rindfleisch, Schuppel, and others seem to have established the
tuberculous nature of the disease.Many authors of a comparatively
recent date have applied the term tuberculosis to this condition, not
because they knew or believed the development of true tubercle was a
constant or essential characteristic, but because they regarded the
words scrofulosis and tuberculosis as synonymous.Notwithstanding the obscurity in which, for so long a time, the
pathology of this disease was involved, certain facts well known to the
earliest writers have been confirmed by continuous observation down to
the present.Its secondary character has been so uniformly recognized
that some of the older authors based its origin upon the absorption and
conveyance along the lymphatic vessels to the glands of some peccant
material originating {1184} in a primary focus of disease.The constant
coexistence with scrofulous affections and pulmonary consumption had
long ago established the direct and primary relation of these diseases
to tabes mesenterica, and authors of recent date, though not so
generally holding the opinion that it is always an intercurrent
complication of these maladies, yet maintain its secondary development.Even Schuppel, whose investigations and conclusions lead in the
direction of an idiopathic origin, admits that the only primary element
is the tuberculosis, which finds its cause in some peripheral
irritation.In the earlier times, as now, tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands has
been observed during every period of life from birth to advanced old
age, but then, as at the present time, the greater number of cases were
known to occur during infancy and childhood.But few cases have been
observed during the earlier months of life or before weaning.Between
the ages of two and eight years is the period of greatest frequency.Though rarer during the later years of childhood, the older the child
the more rapid its progress to a fatal termination.Nursing infants are
not exempt, but those nursed by healthy mothers are much less liable
than the wet-nursed.Among hand-fed infants it is not an uncommon
disease, but it is much more common among the farmed-out children.While, as has been stated, the greatest number of cases occur in those
between two and eight years of age, statistics show that the liability
to it increases from the age of two and a half years up to the eighth,
and, according to some authors, up to the tenth year.At the latter age
there is a remarkable diminution in the number of cases.This fact is
probably due to the greater prevalence of the acute diseases of the
respiratory organs and of the exanthematous diseases among children
during this period of life.Some have attributed it to the more rapid
development and increased functional activity of the mesenteric glands.This circumstance might afford a plausible explanation for the apparent
sudden increase in frequency after the completion of the second year
because of the independent subsistence of children at that age, and the
additional duties imposed upon the alimentary tract and its
dependencies; still, if this were so, the period of greatest frequency
ought to begin at an earlier age and more nearly correspond with the
time of weaning.It is, however, a fact that tubercularization of the
mesenteric glands is more frequently associated with chronic intestinal
inflammation in those over one year than in those under that age.This
fact, together with the greater liability of artificially-fed infants,
would seem to connect, at least in such cases, its secondary origin
with some primary irritation of the intestinal canal.Authors are not yet agreed in regard to the relative frequency of this
disease in boys and girls, though opinions predominate in favor of the
greater number among the males.The statistics of Rilliet and Barthez
and Schmalz show a decidedly greater prevalence among boys.The comparative frequency of tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands
cannot be determined.Louis found disease of the mesenteric glands in
one-fourth of the autopsies of persons dying of phthisis; in 100 adults
dying of the same disease Lombard found tuberculosis of these glands in
10; and in the bodies of 100 tuberculous children he found the glands
tuberculous in 34 cases.In the Hopital des Enfants Maladies tubercles
were found in the mesentery of one-half of the children dying of {1185}
tuberculous affections.In the bodies of children dying of tuberculous
disease in the Children's Hospital of Washington tuberculous
degeneration of the mesenteric glands has been found in two-thirds of
the cases, and without a single exception in those dying of rickets.Authors differ also, and the statistics are equally unreliable, in
regard to the relative frequency of tubercularization of the bronchial
and mesenteric glands.The general opinion seems to be in favor of the
greater frequency in the bronchial glands.In a majority of cases both
sets of glands are found diseased.The geographical distribution of tabes mesenterica is as universal as
that of scrofula and pulmonary phthisis.No country or climate is
exempt, yet there is no locality in which it is endemic.It has been
observed among all civilized nations, in the cold regions as well as in
the tropical countries.Wherever scrofulous and phthisical diseases are
known, there also are found cases of tabes mesenterica.Livingstone has
stated that scrofula is unknown in some regions in Central Africa, and
other travellers have made similar statements in regard to some Indian
tribes.The statistics of the Children's Hospital of Washington show a
far greater frequency among the African race than among the whites.It
belongs to no class or condition of life, but occurs more frequently
among the children of the squalid than among the children of the
affluent and well-to-do.ETIOLOGY.--Predisposing Causes.--Modern as well as the older authors
have very generally accepted the conclusion that a constitutional
tendency or liability to this disease is its most frequent and
potential etiological factor.This predisposition may be either
inherited or acquired.The ancients called it the strumous, and the
more recent writers the scrofulous or tuberculous, diathesis.Lugol
maintained that this diathesis is begotten of old and syphilitic
fathers, and others state that children of parents nearly related and
of those broken down by disease and excesses may inherit it.That it is
transmitted by scrofulous and phthisical parents no one can doubt, but
as yet it cannot be defined to be anything more than a peculiarity of
the constitution which may exhibit abnormal reactions against
irritating influences.The scrofulous habit is believed to be indicated
by physical appearances which represent two extremes.The erethic form
is characterized by a feeble and delicate frame; deficient muscular
development; transparent, smooth, and florid skin; light hair and blue
eyes, large pupils; precocious intellect and sanguine temperament; the
torpid form, by a large head; large and tumid upper lip; soft and
flaccid flesh, bloated appearance; short and thick neck; muscular
incapacity, tumid abdomen, and sluggish intellect.Some of these
features are more frequently symptoms of the actual disease than of the
existence of a predisposition to it, and, except so far as they may
refer to a primary scrofulous or pulmonary disease, cannot be accepted
as indicative of the presence of a constitutional tendency to
tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands.A tumid abdomen, rapid
emaciation, and anaemia are far more valuable signs of the disease of
these glands.Bad air and bad food are also important predisposing causes.They are
conditions to which the children of the poor, especially in large
cities, are constantly exposed.Insufficient protection from climatic
influences, neglect of person, and unhygienic surroundings must be
classed in the same category.It is claimed that vitiated air,
unwholesome habitation, {1186} insufficient or improper food, squalor
and filth may cause the constitutional tendency, as they will certainly
precipitate the development of the disease in those predisposed to it.Exciting Causes.--The border-line between the predisposing and exciting
causes cannot be positively fixed.The presence of tuberculosis or of
some form of scrofulous disease in some other part of the body so
constantly precedes the development of tuberculosis of the mesenteric
glands, even in those who have not exhibited the characteristic
phenomena of the scrofulous diathesis, that such affections must be
regarded as exciting as well as predisposing causes.No one can doubt
the frequent infection of the mesenteric glands in cases of pulmonary
tuberculosis.The probability of systemic infection from a single focus
is universally admitted.These facts and circumstances do not exclude
the possibility of localized tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands.Whether such exclusively local development of tubercles ever occurs
independent of the scrofulous diathesis cannot be determined, but that
the disease does find its exciting cause in inflammatory conditions of
the intestinal mucous membrane cannot be doubted.Schuppel, who asserts
the primary development of the tubercle-formation in lymphatic glands,
does not claim an idiopathic origin, but admits the necessity of a
primary peripheral irritation in direct connection with the affected
gland.The intimate connection between diseases of the intestinal
mucous membrane and of the mesenteric glands is established beyond a
doubt.Vogel and Steiner assert that tabes mesenterica is a common
result of enteritis folliculosa.A primary inflammatory process may not
contain any element which could be classed as tubercle, yet it may
excite secondary tuberculosis of the glands.Whether such a result only
occurs in those who may have acquired or inherited the predisposition
is yet undecided.In many of the cases of tabes mesenterica tuberculous
ulcers are found in the intestines, but it cannot be claimed that such
ulcers are always the primary foci of tuberculous development.If
primary, it is not difficult to understand how the virus may be
transmitted to the glands.It has been claimed that certain articles of food will produce the
disease.Potatoes and rye bread in large quantities and a coarse
vegetable diet have been mentioned among the exciting causes.Deficiency in the quantity of food is a much more frequent cause than
inferiority in quality, yet there can be no doubt that any and every
article of diet that will set up catarrhal inflammation of the
intestinal mucous membrane may become a cause.Irritation of the mucous
membrane of the alimentary tract, induced by coarse, stimulating, or
imperfectly-digested food, or by the improper and frequent use of
purgative medicines, may give rise to disease of the glands; and, even
though the irritation may in itself be trivial, its long continuance or
frequent renewal may prove sufficient, especially in those in whom the
predisposition is present.Malarial and exanthematous diseases have
also been considered exciting causes, and among the latter class
measles and scarlet fever, because of the inflamed condition of the
intestinal mucous membrane which they leave, are the most frequent.Difficult dentition and whooping cough must also be classed in this
category.Recently attention has been called to the probable transmission of the
disease through the milk of diseased cows, but further investigation
and {1187} more reliable data are necessary to establish this
connection.Klebs has deduced the conclusion from recent experiments
that the use of the milk of cows in advanced phthisis will always
produce tuberculosis, which begins as an intestinal catarrh and extends
to the mesenteric glands.Some of the older authors believed that the cure of some chronic
diseases of the skin and mucous membranes and the suppression of
chronic discharges might induce tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands;
but these conditions are now known to be most frequently the initial
manifestations of the scrofulous diathesis, and the mesenteric
complications are far more likely to occur when these primary foci are
neglected and the patient is left to suffer the unabated progress of
the disease.MORBID ANATOMY.--It is not usual to find all the glands of the
mesentery affected at once, nor of those affected all in the same stage
of disease.Newly-affected glands may be found alongside of others in
an advanced condition.In the first stage the glands are enlarged, but
rarely exceeding the size of a filbert; they are firm, but not
inelastic.This change consists in hyperplasia of the
gland-constituents.Microscopic examination shows abundant
cell-proliferation, but the cells are badly constructed and prone to
undergo retrogressive metamorphosis.The cells accumulate in clusters
without any intercellular substance, and compress the lymph-sinuses and
blood-vessels.The second stage is characterized by the commencement of the cheesy
degeneration.The glands enlarge and coalesce in clusters, sometimes
forming large masses of hardened and inelastic glands.On section they
exhibit in the beginning foci of cheesy material imbedded in the
gland-parenchyma.In the further progress of the change the whole gland
is transformed into a homogeneous yellowish substance.In this
condition there are found on microscopic examination globular
corpuscles, nuclei, shrivelled cells, sometimes giant-cells, and most
frequently tubercles.The tubercles are usually found in the follicular
substance.Birch-Hirschfield says the cheesy formations in secondary
tuberculous mesenteric glands are only found in discrete foci, and the
tubercles occur in the follicular substance imbedded in relatively
normal tissue.The cheesy transformation is, according to Virchow, a
necrobiosis of the hyperplastic gland-elements, but Schuppel insists
that it is the result of tubercular development.After a time the
cheesy masses soften, and the glands are converted into sacs containing
a purulent fluid mixed with debris.In this condition they are most
frequently coalesced in bunches, sometimes forming large tumors.The
intervening walls may break down and the whole bunch be transformed
into one large sac filled with purulent fluid and debris.Occasionally
these masses of agglutinated glands become adherent to the abdominal
parietes or to the intestines.Rupture of their walls may occur, and
the contents may be emptied into either the peritoneal cavity or the
intestines.When communication with the intestines takes place, it is
usually through an ulcer on the mucous surface.It is probable that the
cheesy substance may sometimes be absorbed, as Virchow thinks, by
gradual softening proceeding from the surface toward the centre.It is believed that these degenerated glands sometimes undergo the
cretaceous transformation.Such an instance has been reported by
Carswell: "The patient, who when a child had been affected with tabes
{1188} mesenterica and also with swellings of the cervical glands, some
of which ulcerated, died at the age of twenty-one years of inflammation
of the uterus seven days after delivery.Several of the mesenteric
glands contained a dry cheesy matter mixed with a chalky-looking
substance; others were composed of a cretaceous substance; and a tumor
as large as a hen's egg, included within the folds of the peritoneum,
and which appeared to be the remains of a large agglomerated mass of
glands, was filled with a substance resembling a mixture of putty and
dried mortar, moistened with a small quantity of serosity.In the neck,
and immediately behind an old cicatrix in the skin, there were two
glands containing, in several points of their substance, small masses
of hard cretaceous matter."Calcareous concretions have been observed
by Andral and others in the mesenteric glands in cases of chronic
pulmonary disease; and Soemmering records several observations of a
tartar-like substance found in devastated mesenteric glands in cases of
rickets.The morbid appearances in tabes mesenterica are not usually confined to
the changes in the glands.In very many cases the evidences of disease
of the peripheral glands are quite manifest, and in much the larger
number of cases pulmonary phthisis and disease of the bronchial glands
are present.These
consecutive morbid changes are succinctly set forth in the following
notes of an autopsy taken from the records of the Children's Hospital
of Washington, D.C.The subject was a <DW64> boy aged ten, who had been
taken sick a year previous to his death with a bad cold and cough,
followed several months afterward by enlargement and suppuration of the
cervical glands on both sides: "The body was greatly emaciated, the
lips and teeth covered with sordes.Cheesy masses were scattered
throughout the substance of both lungs.The right lung was firmly
adherent to the thoracic walls, the left adherent at apex.The liver
was enlarged and adherent to all adjacent tissues, and contained many
cheesy nodules scattered throughout its substance and over the surface.The gall-bladder was distended with bile.The spleen was normal in
size, very dark, and filled with cheesy masses.The pancreas contained
many similar masses.The peritoneal cavity contained a quantity of
muddy fluid.The peritoneum was dark in color, studded with tubercles,
and ulcerated in a few places.The stomach and intestines were
distended with gas; the walls of stomach thickened, the inner surface
covered with a shiny mucus; in its lower wall was one large ulcer,
penetrating to the peritoneal coat and measuring three-fourths of an
inch in diameter.The peritoneal coat was thickly studded with nodules
resembling tubercles.The small intestines were gangrenous in a few
places; on the inner surface were found fourteen ulcers, varying in
size from one-fourth to one and one-fourth inches in diameter, with
elevated edges and red bases; two penetrated the peritoneal coat.On the mucous surface of the large
intestines there were seven large ulcers, similar in appearance to
those found in the small intestines.Some of Peyer's patches were
ulcerated.The mesenteric glands, some as large as walnuts, were filled
with cheesy material, and the mesentery was dotted over with small
masses of similar matter."In two of the reported cases of chylous effusion into the peritoneal
cavity the rupture of the lacteals was caused by degeneration of the
{1189} mesenteric glands; and in several other cases the rupture was
produced by the presence of tumors, apparently formed by the
agglomeration of numerous degenerated glands.Several cases of fatty diarrhoea from mesenteric phthisis have been
reported.Of these the most conclusive is the case of Hall.[1] The
clinical history of the case and the detection of enlarged mesenteric
glands in the umbilical and hypogastric regions placed the diagnosis
beyond a doubt.It was, however, verified by the discovery of several
vomicae in the lungs, and of mesenteric glands "universally enlarged
and affected with strumous disease.The intestinal mucous membrane was
dotted with patches of ulceration, with here and there prominent masses
of strumous deposit on the surface."[Footnote 1: _Guy's Hospital Reports_, vol.i., 3d Series, 1855, p.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--It is not possible to describe a definite and uniform
clinical history of this disease.As a secondary complication of
pulmonary phthisis and scrofulous affections the preliminary symptoms
are so constantly identified with the development and progress of these
maladies that, as a rule, the initial stage cannot be recognized by any
special assemblage of symptoms.In any tuberculous or scrofulous child
the possible implication of the mesenteric glands may be predicated
upon any array of symptoms that would establish the presence of these
classes of disease.And even in the absence of the rational and direct
signs of such affections, in those exhibiting the physical evidences of
the strumous diathesis, more especially when it is inherited, the
symptoms of any trivial departure from health, such as the catching of
cold, irritation of the alimentary tract, or protracted convalescence
from any of the exanthematous or intestinal diseases, may constitute
the initial history of tabes mesenterica.In such subjects debility and
anaemia, from whatsoever cause they may apparently result--and, in
fact, any manifest lowering of the standard of health, whether gradual
or precipitate, and without assignable cause--may mark the beginning of
the process of change in the parenchyma of the glands that will
terminate in tuberculosis.The later as well as the earlier history may
be completely masked by the symptomatology of other diseases belonging
to the tuberculous class; and so grave, as a rule, are such primary and
coexisting affections that definite recognition of this complication or
localized extension of the systemic infection becomes more a matter of
skilful diagnosis than of practical utility.But in those cases where disease of the respiratory organs and of the
bronchial glands can be excluded the general symptomatology becomes of
paramount importance.And in view of the value of prophylactic measures
which may be employed to arrest, limit, or delay the localized
tuberculosis of these glands, the precursory symptoms may be of special
significance.This condition may be characterized by languor and
dulness or marked debility and anaemia, with loss of color, attended
with flatulence, stomachal disturbance, frequent eructations consisting
mainly of mucus, a sense of uneasiness in the abdomen after the
ingestion of food, a variable appetite, sometimes voracious and
occasionally depraved.Sometimes a dislike for fatty foods is a
prominent symptom.The tongue may be coated, the breath is usually
foul, and some have said the body emits an acid odor.If these symptoms
occur in a child of the {1190} scrofulous diathesis, or be directly or
remotely associated with a previous gastro-intestinal disease, or occur
or persist during the convalescence of some of the acute affections of
infancy and childhood which stand in etiological relation to this
disease, they may justify a reasonable presumption of commencing change
in the mesenteric glands.This presumption will be strengthened by
emaciation, a more marked disturbance of the digestive function,
attended with fetid and occasionally whitish stools, a tumid belly, and
deep, lancinating abdominal pains of short duration, recurring at long
intervals and neither relieved nor aggravated by pressure or an
evacuation.Some have attributed special importance to a chalky
appearance and loss of consistency of the stools, indicating the
suspension of absorption by the lacteals.There may also be slight
evening fever.Later, the enlargement of the belly increases, the
emaciation becomes more marked and rapid, the appetite more variable,
sometimes very voracious, the alvine discharges more fetid or less
consistent, sometimes putty-like, and generally irregular or
constipated.The febrile exacerbations are more decided, and sometimes
chills may occur at irregular intervals.When, in addition to these
symptoms, either during the earlier or later stages, the enlargement of
the glands can be detected, the clinical picture is complete.In
consequence of the tympanitic distension of the abdomen, which usually
increases with the progress of the disease, it is impossible in a
majority of cases to detect the glandular enlargement; especially is
this true when the affected glands are separate; but, as frequently
happens during the last stage, when large tumors are formed by the
coalescence of a number of diseased glands the diagnosis may be easily
determined.In the absence of the discovery of enlarged glands the
diagnosis cannot be considered positive.They are usually most readily
found in the region of the umbilicus, and may in some cases, even when
the tension of the abdomen is very great, be detected by grasping the
abdomen with the hand and compressing it between the fingers and thumb
so that the enlarged glands will be brought in close contiguity to the
walls and be felt immediately under the fingers.If a tumor should be
present and the peritoneal cavity be free from fluid, its locality may
be recognized by a sense of resistance and circumscribed area of
diminished resonance, and then definitely outlined by palpation.Underwood says: "Indigestion, costiveness or purging, irregular
appetite, flushed cheeks or a total loss of color, impaired strength
and spirits, remitting fever, and a hard and tumid belly, with
emaciated limbs, are amongst the more common symptoms, attending at one
period or other, of this disease."When the diagnosis has been made out, it is not impossible to determine
the stage of the disease.The progressive intensity of the symptoms,
with rapid emaciation as a rule, bears a definite relation to the
progress of the morbid changes taking place in the glands.It must,
however, be borne in mind that children have died of tabes mesenterica
who had enjoyed excellent health up to the moment of death, and the
autopsy disclosed the condition of the glands, which had not been
suspected during life.In the case previously cited, in which the
autopsy exhibited such grave lesions of the stomach, liver, spleen,
pancreas, and intestinal mucous membrane, the clinical phenomena were
at no time commensurate with the gravity of the morbid changes.{1191} DIAGNOSIS.--In the absence of the proof of the presence of
enlarged glands or of a tumor the diagnosis cannot be positively
determined.The enlargement and tympanitic distension of the abdomen do
not necessarily establish the existence of glandular disease, for they
are present in a great many conditions of ill-health in children.Nor
is the coexistence of a tumid belly, emaciation, and fever sufficient,
for they are found in other tuberculous and in gastro-intestinal
diseases.The discovery of enlarged discrete glands by palpation, as
before described, in connection with such disturbances of nutrition as
have been set forth, constitute the strongest presumption in favor of
tabes mesenterica.The presence of enlarged glands unaccompanied by the
ordinary symptoms of the tuberculous or scrofulous processes is
inconclusive, because the glandular hypertrophy may be a simple
hyperplasia, entirely independent of any tendency to retrogressive
metamorphosis.There is usually some tenderness on pressure, but this
may be present in any disease of the abdominal viscera.When the glands
are of sufficient size, they may, by pressure, produce secondary
derangements.Cramps in the legs may be caused by pressure on nerves.Oedema of the legs and dilatation of the superficial abdominal veins
may result from compression of venous trunks."If," says Eustace Smith,
"these veins are seen to ramify on the abdominal surface and to join
the veins on the thoracic walls, tabes may be suspected in the absence
of chronic peritonitis and enlargement of the liver."Ascites may be
present, but is not a necessary result of disease of the glands.When a tumor has been discovered by palpation, it is necessary to
determine its glandular nature.If situated about the umbilicus, in
front of the spinal column, if irregular, hard, and feeling like a
congeries of irregularly-rounded nodules, the evidence is very decided
in favor of its glandular origin.But care must be taken to exclude
tumors formed by fecal accumulations and masses attached to the
omentum.Omental tumors are usually more movable, better defined, more
superficial, and regular in form.Cancerous masses sometimes simulate
glandular tumors.The general history of the case and the age of the
patient are usually sufficient to make a diagnosis by exclusion.Rilliet and Barthez distinguished a cancerous pancreas by the presence
of vomiting, jaundice, and abdominal pains.The writer has many times based a conjectural diagnosis--which was
verified by a post-mortem examination--upon the presence of a tumid
abdomen, increasing emaciation, with the history of a protracted
gastro-intestinal catarrh, and an irregular febrile curve characterized
by frequent subnormal temperatures.He has also observed a number of
cases of protracted diarrhoea in children, accompanied with extreme
emaciation, notwithstanding the appetite was good, sometimes even
voracious, and the food taken was ample, nutritious, and easily
digested, in which the stools, varying from two to three, or twice as
many, daily, were whitish, leaden, or slate-, sometimes
semi-fluid, at other times containing lumps or masses of putty
consistence, presenting to the naked eye a greasy appearance and to the
touch a fatty feel, and at the autopsy has found only thinness and
transparency of the coat of the small intestines and degenerated
mesenteric glands.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is decidedly unfavorable.So far as is known
to the writer, there is but one recorded case of recovery in which the
{1192} diagnosis was indisputable and the fact of a cure was
established by an autopsy.This was the case reported by Carswell,
before referred to.The older and some of the modern authors have
claimed many recoveries, but it must be manifest to every student of
pathological anatomy that the mistaken diagnoses must have been nearly
if not quite as numerous as the cases of cure.The writer has not
witnessed a single case of recovery, but he has observed very many
cured cases of disease which exhibited all the subjective and objective
symptoms of tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands, save and except
those by which its existence can alone be definitely and positively
established.The case of Carswell demonstrates a remote possibility of
cure by the cretaceous metamorphosis of the degenerated glands in a
subject exhibiting the scrofulous diathesis.In view of this isolated
observation, one cannot refuse to accept a similar possibility in cases
in which the disease may be localized and confined to a few of the
glands.In such cases, if recognized previous to the formation of
cheesy foci, the possibility of staying, limiting, and perhaps
occasionally curing, the disease should not be regarded as absolutely
hopeless; yet the opportunities of examining the glands in the first
stage of change has so rarely occurred that no one is authorized to
assert that the hyperplasia is the true picture of the condition in
which those in the advanced stage had its beginning; nor has any one
claimed to have witnessed the progressive stages of resolution taking
place in such glands.The cretaceous transformation is an accepted though remote possibility,
and absorption by means of gradual softening of the cheesy masses is
perhaps a reasonable hypothesis.But even if either of these processes
was an occasional termination of the disease, it could only lessen its
gravity and prolong life, with an incomplete recovery, in those few
cases in which the tuberculous or scrofulous changes were confined to a
less number of glands than was necessary to maintain the nutrition of
the body.For while there is no serious obstacle to the flow of chyle
through the glands in the condition of simple hyperplasia, it is
completely obstructed in those transformed into cheesy masses or
purulent collections.The channels through the glands must sooner or
later be obliterated by the presence of the abundant cell-proliferation
which characterizes the initial stage of change in this disease.For if
the compression is sufficient to cut off the supply of blood, it must
prove equally destructive to the complex system of lymph-paths.To the
impermeability of the glands must the emaciation and exhaustion which
mark the course of the disease, to a greater or less degree according
to the number of glands involved, be due.If the investigations of Schuppel should be verified, and the primary
tubercle-formations be accepted as the initial stage of change, the
prognosis will be less favorable, but a distinct line of demarcation
may be established between two classes of cases in each of which cheesy
transformation may occur, but in one the tubercle-formations may be
primary, and in the other secondary.In the latter class the prognosis
may be more favorable, because treatment may be effective if commenced
prior to the beginning of the retrogressive metamorphosis.COURSE, DURATION, AND COMPLICATIONS.--When tabes is a complication of
pulmonary or bronchial phthisis, or when either of the latter {1193}
diseases appears as an intercurrent affection during the course of a
primary localized tuberculosis of these glands, the glandular
degeneration runs a more rapid course.When it appears as an extension
of external scrofulous affections or finds its cause in
gastro-intestinal irritation, its course is usually less rapid.The
number of glands involved greatly influences its duration.The
mechanical impediment to nutrition offered by a large number of
impermeable glands promotes rapid emaciation and exhaustion.The
condition of the mucous coat of the alimentary tract offers many
considerations that affect its course and duration.Follicular
enteritis hastens, and tuberculous ulceration of the mucous membrane
speedily brings, the case to a fatal termination.Some of the older authors refer to the frequent complication of rickets
with tabes mesenterica, and the writer in numerous post-mortem
examinations of the bodies of children dying of rickets has invariably
found cheesy mesenteric glands.In view of the fact that rickets is
constantly associated with disturbance of the alimentary tract, it
should not be a surprise to find the glands in such close contiguity
to, and having vascular communication with, the diseased mucous surface
in a condition of hyperplasia.Simple hypertrophy is probably a common
complication in cases which terminate by recovery, but there must be
some element of cause, other than inflammation of the mucous membrane
of the intestines, that determines the retrogressive metamorphosis.Several of the older authors have classed rickets in the category of
strumous diseases, and it may be that in the fatal cases tuberculosis
of the mesenteric glands is a local expression of this diathesis.TREATMENT.--The treatment consists, for the most part, in methods of
prevention and palliation.The tendency to disease of the lymphatic
glands in scrofulous children is so constant that it is important to
remove all sources of irritation and to combat all influences likely to
hasten or promote the localization of the constitutional condition.All
chronic discharges and diseases of the skin and mucous membrane, the
continuance of which might produce glandular complications, should be
cured as speedily as possible, slight colds should receive prompt
attention, and catarrhal inflammations of the respiratory organs should
be arrested as quickly as the resources of science will permit.The
alimentary tract demands constant and careful observation.Trivial
disorders should not be neglected: the causes should be ascertained and
removed.Digestion and nutrition should be maintained at a healthy
standard.The hygiene of person, dwelling, and sleeping apartments
merits constant and intelligent supervision.As stated above, tabes of the mesenteric glands is so frequently
secondary to other diseases of a scrofulous nature that the danger lies
in the failure to arrest or cure such affections.It is unfortunately
too true that some of them are often beyond the resources of medical
skill, but in many cases the initial manifestations of the strumous
diathesis are either entirely neglected or inappropriately treated.In
many such cases the final and fatal complication of mesenteric phthisis
could be prevented.The treatment of these affections belongs properly
to the subjects of tuberculosis and scrofula, to be found in other
parts of this System of Medicine.Localized tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands is so often, either
{1194} directly or indirectly, connected with catarrhal inflammations
of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane that the cure of these
affections cannot be too strongly insisted upon as an effective method
of prevention.This is especially true with children exhibiting the
physical signs of the strumous diathesis.When it is inherited from a
diseased mother, it may be necessary to resort to artificial feeding
before the proper time for weaning has been reached.In such cases no
uniform rule can be arbitrarily followed.The condition of both mother
and child must be considered, and cases will occur which will demand
the exercise of the most cautious discretion and diligent observation.When the disease has become established but little can be accomplished.In such cases the treatment refers to the palliation of symptoms and
the maintenance of nutrition.Pain, when present, must be relieved--if
necessary by anodynes, either given internally or applied in the form
of cataplasms.Most often it is due to the coexisting disease of the
intestinal mucous membrane or to the ingestion of unsuitable foods.The
diet should be regulated and limited to nutritious and easily-digested
articles.Sometimes, even in cases of advanced degeneration of the
glands, great benefit may be temporarily obtained by attention to the
diet.Diarrhoea should be controlled, but when dependent upon
tuberculous ulcerations of the intestinal mucous membrane but little
can be done toward delaying the fatal termination.When a large number
of glands are affected, it will be necessary to limit the diet to such
nutrient fluids as may be absorbed from the stomach.The medical treatment is confined to a few remedies.Faulty nutrition
is the predominant factor, and the drugs employed should be directed to
the improvement of the assimilative functions.The lacto-phosphate of
iron in the form of syrup, or the phosphates in the form of the
compound syrup, sometimes prove valuable tonics.The lacto-phosphate
may be given in combination with cod-liver oil.This latter, either
internally or by inunction, is the most valuable and universally
applicable of all remedies.The mistake is very frequently made of
giving too large quantities.Few children can digest as much as a
drachm administered three times a day.In Washington it is usually
given in the form of the phosphatic emulsion, and has proved in the
service of the Children's Hospital a valuable and effective remedy in
the nutritional disorders of children.Of the chalybeates, the syrup of
the iodide of iron is by far the most valuable; this may be given alone
or in combination with cod-liver oil.It is specially indicated when
anaemia is a marked characteristic.Some recent reports favor the
employment of pancreatized foods.The ointment of the iodide of lead
has been highly extolled as a local application to the belly.The
nature of the disease should be constantly borne in mind, and all
depressing agencies should be sedulously avoided.{1195}
