It was a wonderful discovery of our modern morale, that a renegade,
being a madman, should not be considered a renegade in earnest, or
responsible for his actions.Nevertheless, these unfortunate beings,
should they have better thoughts, or as mad-doctors have it, "a lucid
interval," and leave the profession of the Mahometan faith, and
afterwards again relapse into madness, and turn Mahometans once more,
are doomed to irretrievable slavery, or if they relapse, to death
itself; the Mahometan law, punishes relapsing renegades with death.This
curious clause says, "that though being madmen, they must abide their
decision (of unreason) and their excuses will not be accepted."This
said article was confirmed as late as the year 1824 by the
plenipotentiary of a nation, which boasts of being the most free and
civilized of Europe, and whose people spend annually millions for the
conversion of the heathen, and the extinction of the slave-trade.The last clause of Article IV also demands our attention, viz."And if
any English merchant should happen to have a vessel in or outside the
port, he may go on board himself, or any of his people, without being
liable to pay anything whatever."Now in spite of this (but of course forgotten) stipulation, the
merchants of Mogador are not permitted to visit their own vessels, nor
those of other persons which may happen to be in or outside the port.It
is true, the authorities plead the reason of their refusal to be, "The
merchants are indebted to the Emperor:" neither will the authorities
take any security, and arbitrarily, and insolently prohibit, under any
circumstances, the merchants from visiting their vessels.I have said
enough to shew that our treaties (I beg the reader's pardon,
"capitulations") with the Emperor of Morocco, require immediate
revision, and to be amended with articles more suited to the spirit of
the age, and European civilization, as likewise more consistent with the
dignity of Great Britian.The treaty for the supply of provisions, especially cattle, to the
garrison of Gibraltar is either a verbal one, or a secret arrangement,
for no mention is made of it in the published state paper documents.It
is probably a mere verbal unwritten understanding, but, neverthelesss is
more potent in its working than the written treaties.This is not the
first time that the unwritten has proved stronger than the written
engagement.The two different aspects by which the strength and resources of the
Empire of Morocco may be viewed or estimated.--Native appellation of
Morocco.--Geographical limits of this country.--Historical review of the
inhabitants of North Africa, and the manner in which this region was
successively peopled and conquered.--The distinct varieties of the human
race, as found in Morocco.--Nature of the soil and climate of this
country.--Derem, or the Atlas chain of mountains.--Natural
products.--The Shebbel, or Barbary salmon; different characters of
exports of the Northern and Southern provinces.--The Elaeonderron
Argan.--Various trees and plants.--Mines.--The Sherb-Errech, or
Desert-horse.The empire of Morocco may be considered under two aspects, as to its
extent, and as to its influence.It may be greatly circumscribed or
expanded to an almost indefinite extent, according to the feelings, or
imagination, of the writer, or speaker.A resident here gave me a meagre
_tableau_, something like this,

  The city of Morocco    50,000 souls.
        "Fez        40,000   "
        "     Mequinez   25,000   "
                        -------
                        115,000   "

The maritime cities contain little more than 100,000 inhabitants, making
altogether about 220,000.Over the provinces of the south, Sous and
Wadnoun, the Sultan has no real power; so the south is cut off as an
integral portion of the empire.Over the Rif, or the northern Berber
provinces, the Sultan exercises a precarious sovereignty, every man's
gun or knife is there his law and authority.Fez contains a disaffected
population, teeming some years since with the adherents of Abd-el-Kader.Then the Atlas is full of quasi-independent Berber tribes, who detest
equally the Arabs and the Moorish government; finally, Tafilett and the
provinces on the eastern side of the Atlas, are too remote to feel the
influence of the central government.As to military force, the Emperor's standing army does not amount to
more than 20 or 30,000 Nigritian troops, and all cavalry.The irregular
and contingent cavalry and infantry can never be depended upon, even
under such a chief as Abd-el-Kader was.They must always be fed, but
they will not, at any summons, leave the cultivation of their fields, or
their wives and children defenceless.As to the commerce of the Empire, with fifty ships visiting Mogador and
other maritime cities, the amount, per annum, does not exceed forty
millions of francs, or about a million and a half sterling including
imports and exports.Such is the view of the Empire on the depreciating
side.Another resident of this country gives the opposite or more favourable
view.The Sultan is the head of the orthodox religion of the Mussulmen of the
West, and more firmly established on his throne than the Sultan of the
Ottomans.His influence, as a sovereign Shereef, spreads throughout
Western Barbary and Central Africa, wherever there is a Mussulman to be
found.In the event of an enemy appearing in the shape of a Christian,
or Infidel, all would unite, including the most disjointed and hostile
tribes against the common foe of Islamism.The Sultan, upon an emergency or insurrection in his own empire, by the
politic distribution of titles of _Marabout_ (often used as a species of
degree of D.D.)and other honours attached to the Shereefian Parasol,
can likewise easily excite one chief against another, and consolidate
his power over their intestine divisions.His Moorish Majesty, at any
rate, has always actual possession in his favour; and, whether he really
governs the whole Empire or not, or to the extent which he has presumed
to mark out its boundaries, he can always proclaim to his disjointed
provinces that he does so govern it and exercise authority; and, in
general, he does succeed in making both his own people and foreign
nations believe in his pretensions, and acknowledge his power.The truth lies, perhaps, between these extremes.The Shereefs once
pretended to exercise authority over all Western Sahara as far as
Timbuctoo, that is to say, all that region of the great desert lying
west of the Touaricks.The account of the expedition of the Shereef Mohammed, who penetrated as
far as Wadnoun, and which took place more than three centuries ago, as
related by Marmol, leaves no doubt of the ancient ambition of the
sovereign of Morocco.And although this pretension has now been given
up, they still claim sovereignty over the oases of Touat, a month's
journey in the Sahara.Formerly, indeed, the authority of the Maroquine
Sultans over Touat and the south appears to have been more real and
effective.Diego de Torres relates that, in his time, the Shereefs maintained a
force of ten thousand cavalry in the provinces of Draha, Tafilett and
Jaguriri, and Monsieur Mouette counts Touat as one of the provinces of
the Empire.The Sheikh Haj Kasem, in the itinerary which he dictated to
Monsieur Delaporte, says that, about forty years ago, Agobli and
Taoudeni depended on Morocco.This, however, is what the people of
Ghadames told me, whilst they admitted that the oases neither did
contain a single officer of the Emperor, nor did the people pay his
Shereefian Highness the smallest impost.The Sultan's authority is now
indeed purely nominal, and the French look forward to the time when
these fine and centrally placed oases will form "une dependance de
l'Algerie."The only countries in the South which now pay a regular impost to the
Emperor, are Tafilett, limited to the valley of Fez, Wad-Draha as far as
the lake Ed-Debaia, and Sous.The countries of Sidi, Hashem, and Wadnoun
nominally acknowledge the Emperor, and occasionally send a present; but
the most mountainous, between Sous and Wad-Draha, which has been called
Guezoula or Gouzoula, and is said to be peopled by a Berber race, sprang
from the ancient Gelulir, is entirely independent.In the north and west
are also many quasi-independent tribes, but still the Emperor keeps up a
sort of authority over them; and, if nothing more, is content simply
with being called their Sultan.Maroquine Moors call their country El-Gharb, "The West," and sometimes
Mogrel-el-Aksa, that is "The far West:" [8] the name seems to have
originated something in the same way among the Saracenic conquerors, as
the "Far West" with the Anglo-Americans, arising from an apprehensive
feeling of indefinite extent of unexplored country.Among the Moors
generally, Morocco is now often called, "Blad Muley Abd Errahman", or
"Country of the Sultan Muley Abd Errahman."The northwestern portion of
Morocco was first conquered; Morocco Proper, Sous and Tafilett were
added with the progress of conquest.But scarcely a century has elapsed
since their union under one common Sultan, whilst the diverse population
of the four States are solely kept together by the interests and
feelings of a common religion.The Maroquine Empire, with its present limits, is bounded on the north
by the Mediterranean Sea and the Straits of Gibraltar, on the west by
the Atlantic Ocean and the Canary and Madeira Islands, on the south by
the deserts of Noun Draha and the Sahara, on the east by Algeria, the
Atlas, and Tafilett, on the borders of Sahara beyond their eastern
<DW72>s.The greatest length from north to south is about five hundred
miles, with a breadth from east to west varying considerably at an
average of two hundred, containing an available or really _dependent_
territory of some 137,400 square miles, or nearly as large as Spain; and
the whole is situate between the 28 deg.Monsieur
Benou, in his "Description Geographique de l'Empire de Maroc" says
Morocco "comprend une superficie d'environ 5,775 myriametres carres, un
peu plus grande, par consequant, que celle de la France, qui equivaut a
5,300."This then is the available and immediate territory of Morocco,
not comprising distant dependencies, where the Shereefs exercise a
precarious or nominal sovereignty.Previously to particularizing the population of Morocco, I shall take
the liberty of introducing some general observations on the whole of the
inhabitants of North Africa, and the manner in which this country was
successively peopled and conquered.Greek and Roman classics contain
only meagre and confused notions of the aborigines of North Africa,
although they have left us a mass of details on the Punic wars, and the
struggles which ensued between the Romans and the ancient Libyans,
before the domination of the Latin Republic could be firmly established.Herodotus cites the names of a number of people who inhabited North
Africa, mostly confining himself to repeat the fables or the more
interesting facts, of which they were the object.The nomenclature of Strabo is neither so extensive, nor does it contain
more precise or correct information.He mentions the celebrated oasis of
Ammonium and the nation of the Nasamones.Farther west, behind Carthage
and the Numidians, he also notices the Getulians, and after them the
Garamantes, a people who appear to have colonized both the oasis of
Ghadames and the oases of Fezzan.Ptolemy makes the whole of the
Mauritania, including Algeria and Morocco, to be bounded on the south by
tribes, called Gaetuliae and Melanogaeluti, on the south the latter
evidently having contracted alliance of blood with the <DW64>s.According to Sallust, who supports himself upon the authority of
Heimpsal, the Carthaginian historian, "North Africa was first occupied
by Libyans and Getulians, who were a barbarous people, a heterogeneous
mass, or agglomeration of people of different races, without any form of
religion or government, nourishing themselves on herbs, or devouring the
raw flesh of animals killed in the chase; for first amongst these were
found Blacks, probably some from the interior of Africa, and belonging
to the great <DW64> family; then whites, issue of the Semitic stock, who
apparently constituted, even at that early period, the dominant race or
caste.Later, but at an epoch absolutely unknown, a new horde of
Asiatics," says Sallust, "of Medes, Persians, and Armenians, invaded the
countries of the Atlas, and, led on by Hercules, pushed their conquests
as far as Spain."[9]

The Persians, mixing themselves with the former inhabitants of the
coast, formed the tribes called Numides, or Numidians (which embrace the
provinces of Tunis and Constantina), whilst the Medes and the Armenians,
allying themselves with the Libyans, nearer to Spain, it is pretended,
gave existence to a race of Moors, the term Medes being changed into
that of Moors.[10]

As to the Getulians confined in the valleys of the Atlas, they resisted
all alliance with the new immigrants, and formed the principal nucleus
of those tribes who have ever remained in North Africa, rebels to a
foreign civilization, or rather determined champions of national
freedom, and whom, imitating the Romans and Arabs, we are pleased to
call Barbarians or Berbers (Barbari Braber [11]), and whence is derived
the name of the Barbary States.But the Romans likewise called the
aboriginal tribes of North Africa, Moors, or Mauri, and some contend
that Moors and Berbers are but two different names for the aboriginal
tribes, the former being of Greek and the latter of African origin.The
Romans might, however, confound the African term berber with barbari,
which latter they applied, like the Greeks, to all strangers and
foreigners.The revolutions of Africa cast a new tribe of emigrants upon
the North African coast, who, if we are to believe the Byzantine
historian, Procopius, of the sixth century, were no other than
Canaanites, expelled from Palestine by the victorious arms of Joshua,
when he established the Israelites in that country.Procopius affirms
that, in his time, there was a column standing at Tigisis, on which was
this inscription:--"We are those who fled from the robber Joshua, son of
Nun."[12] Now whether Tigisis was in Algeria, or was modern Tangier, as
some suppose, it is certain there are several traditions among the
Berber tribes of Morocco, which relate that their ancestors were driven
out of Palestine.Also, the Berber historian, Ebn-Khal-Doun, who
flourished in the fourteenth century, makes all the Berbers descend from
one Bar, the son of Mayigh, son of Canaan.However, what may be the
truths of these traditions of Sallust or Procopius, there is no
difficulty in believing that North Africa was peopled by fugitive and
roving tribes, and that the first settlers should be exposed to be
plundered by succeeding hordes; for such has been the history of the
migrations of all the tribes of the human race.But the most ancient historical fact on which we can depend is, the
invasion, or more properly, the successive invasions of North Africa by
the Phoenicians.Their definite establishment on these shores took place
towards the foundation of Carthage, about 820 years before our era.Yet
we know little of their intercourse or relations with the aboriginal
tribes.When the Romans, a century and a half before Christ, received,
or wrested, the rule of Africa from the Phoenicians, or Carthaginians,
they found before them an indigenous people, whom they indifferently
called Moors, Berbers, or Barbarians.A part of these people were called
also Nudides, which is perhaps considered the same term as nomades.Some ages later, the Romans, too weak to resist a vigorous invasion of
other conquerors, were subjugated by the Vandals, who, during a century,
held possession of North Africa; but, after this time, the Romans again
raised their heads, and completely expelled or extirpated the Vandals,
so that, as before, there were found only two people or races in Africa:
the Romans and the Moors, or aborigines.Towards the middle of the seventh century after Christ, and a few years
after the death of Mahomet, the Romans, in the decline of their power,
had to meet the shock of the victorious arms of the Arabians, who poured
in upon them triumphant from the East; but, too weak to resist this new
tide of invasion, they opposed to them the aborigines, which latter were
soon obliged to continue alone the struggle.The Arabian historians, who recount these wars, speak of _Roumi_ or
Romans (of the Byzantine empire) and the Braber--evidently the
aboriginal tribes--who promptly submitted to the Arabs to rid themselves
of the yoke of the Romans; but, after the retreat of their ancient
masters, they revolted and remained a long time in arms against their
new conquerors--a rule of action which all subjugated nations have been
wont to follow.Were we English now to attempt to expel the French from
Algeria, we, undoubtedly, should be joined by the Arabs; but who would,
most probably, soon also revolt against us, were we to attempt to
consolidate our dominion over them.In the first years of the eighth century, and at the end of the first
century of the Hegira, the conquering Arabs passed over to Spain, and,
inasmuch as they came from Mauritania, the people of Spain gave them the
name of Moors (that of the aborigines of North Africa), although they
had, perhaps, nothing in common with them, if we except their Asiatic
origin.Another and most singular name was also given to these Arab
warriors in France and other parts of Europe--that of Saracens--whose
etymology is extremely obscure.[13] From this time the Spaniards have
always given the names of Moors (_los Moros_), not only to the Arabs of
Spain, but to all the Arabs; and, confounding farther these two
denominations, they have bestowed the name of _Moros_ upon the Arabs of
Morocco and those in the environs of Senegal.The Arabs who invaded Northern Africa about 650, were all natives of
Asia, belonging to various provinces of Arabia, and were divided into
Ismaelites, Amalekites, Koushites, &c. They were all warriors; and it is
considered a title of nobility to have belonged to their first irruption
of the enthusiastic sons of the Prophet.A second invasion took place towards the end of the ninth century--an
epoch full of wars--during which, the Caliph Kaim transported the seat
of his government from Kairwan to Cairo, ending in the complete
submission of Morocco to the power of Yousef Ben Tashfin.One cannnot
now distinguish which tribe of Arabs belong to the first or the second
invasion, but all who can shew the slightest proof, claim to belong to
the first, as ranking among a band of noble and triumphant warriors.After eight centuries of rule, the Arabs being expelled from Spain, took
refuge in Barbary, but instead of finding the hospitality and protection
of their brethren, the greater part of them were pillaged or massacred.The remnant of these wretched fugitives settled along the coast; and it
is to their industry and intelligence that we owe the increase, or the
foundation of many of the maritime cities.Here, considered as strangers
and enemies by the natives, whom they detested, the new colonists sought
for, and formed relations with Turks and renegades of all nations,
whilst they kept themselves separate from the Arabs and Berbers.This,
then, is the _bona-fide_ origin of the people whom we now generally call
Moors.History furnishes us with a striking example of how the expelled
Arabs of Spain united with various adventurers against the Berber and
North African Arabs.In the year 1500, a thousand Andalusian cavaliers,
who had emigrated to Algiers, formed an alliance with the Barbarossas
and their fleet of pirates; and, after expelling the native prince,
built the modern city of Algiers.And such was the origin of the
Algerine Corsairs.The general result of these observations would, therefore, lead us to
consider the Moors of the Romans, as the Berbers or aborigines of North
Africa, and the Moors of the Spaniards, as pure Arabians; and if,
indeed, these Arabian cavaliers marshalled with them Berbers, as
auxiliaries, for the conquest of Spain, this fact does not militate
against the broad assumption.The so-called Moors of Senegal and the Sahara, as well as those of
Morocco, are chiefly a mixture of Berbers, Arabs and <DW64>s; but the
present Moors located in the northern coast of Africa, are rather the
descendants from the various conquering nations, and especially from
renegades and Christian slaves.The term Moors is not known to the natives themselves.The people speak
definitely enough of Arabs and of various Berber tribes.The population
of the towns and cities are called generally after the names of these
towns and cities, whilst Tuniseen and Tripoline is applied to all the
inhabitants of the great towns of Tunis and Tripoli.Europeans resident
in Barbary, as a general rule, call all the inhabitants of towns--Moors,
and the peasants or people residents in tents--Arabs.But, in Tripoli, I
found whole villages inhabited by Arabs, and these I thought might be
distinguished as town Arabs.Then the mountains of Tripoli are covered
with Arab villages, and some few considerable towns are inhabited by
people who are _bona-fide_ Arabs.Finally, the capitals of North Africa
are filled with every class of people found in the country.The question is then where shall we draw the line of distinction in the
case of nationalities?or can we, with any degree of precision, define
the limits which distinguish the various races in North Africa?With
regard to the Blacks or <DW64> tribes, there can be no great difficulty.The Jews are also easily distinguished from the rest of the people as
well by their national features as by their dress and habits or customs
of living.But, when we come to the Berbers, Arabs, Moors and Turks, we
can only distinguish them in their usual and ordinary occupations and
manners of life.Whenever they are intermixed, or whenever they change
their position, that is to say, whenever the Arab or Berber comes to
dwell in a town, or a Moor or a Turk goes to reside in the country,
adopting the Arab or Berber dress and mode of living, it is no longer
possible to distinguish the one from the other, or mark the limitation
of races.And since it is seen that the aborigines of Northern Africa consisted,
with the exception of the <DW64> tribes, of the Asiatics of the Caucasian
race or variety, many of whom, like the Phoenicians, have peopled
various cities and provinces of Europe, it is therefore not astonishing
we should find all the large towns and cities of North Africa, where the
human being becomes _policed_, refined and civilized sooner than in
remote and thinly-inhabited districts, teeming with a population, which
at once challenges an European type, and a corresponding origin with the
great European family of nations.North Africa is wonderfully homogeneous in the matter of religion.The
people, indeed, have but one religion.Even the extraneous Judaism is
the same in its Deism--depression of the female--circumcision and many
of the religious customs, festivals and traditions.And this has a
surprising effect in assimilating the opposite character and sharpest
peculiarities of various races of otherwise distinct and independant
origin.The population of Morocco presents five distant races and classes of
people; Berbers, Arabs, Moors, Jews and <DW64>s.Turks are not found in
Morocco, and do not come so far west; but sons of Turks by Moorish women
in Kouroglies are included among the Moors, that have emigrated from
Algeria.Maroquine Berbers, include the varieties of the Amayeegh [14]
and the Shelouh, who mostly are located in the mountains, while the
Arabs are settled on the plains.The Moors are the inhabitants of towns and cities, consisting of a
mixture of nearly all races, a great proportion of them being of the
descendants of the Moors expelled from Spain.All these races have been,
and will still be, farther noticed in the progress of the work.The
proximate amount of this population is six millions.The greater number
of the towns and cities are situate on the coast, excepting the three or
four capitals, or imperial cities.The other towns of the interior
should be considered rather as forts to awe neighbouring tribes, or as
market villages (_souks_), where the people collect together for the
disposal and exchange of their produce.Numerous tribes, located in the
Atlas, escape the notice of the imposts of imperial authority.Their
varieties and amount of population are equally unknown.In the immense
group of Gibel Thelge (snowy mountains), some of the tribes are said to
have their faces shaved, like Christians, and to wear boots.We can
understand why a people inhabiting a cold region of rain and mists and
perpetual snow should wear boots; but as to their shaving like
Christians, this is rather vague.But it is not impossible the Atlas
contains the descendants of some European refugees.The nature of the soil and climate of Morocco are not unlike those of
Spain and Portugal; and though Morocco does not materially differ from
other parts of Barbary, its greater extent of coast on the Atlantic,
along which the tradewind of the north coast blows nine months out of
twelve, and its loftier ridges of the Atlas, so temper its varied
surface of hill and plain and vast declivities that, together with the
absence of those marshy districts which in hot climates engender fatal
disease, this country may be pronounced, excepting perhaps Tunis, the
most healthy in all Africa.In the northern provinces, the climate is nearly the same as that of
Spain; in the southern there is less rain and more of the desert heat,
but this is compensated for by the greater fertility in the production
of valuable staple articles of commerce.Nevertheless, Morocco has its
extremes of heat and cold, like all the North African coast.The most striking object of this portion of the crust of the globe, is
the vast Atlas chain of mountains [15], which traverses Morocco from
north-east to south-west, whose present ascertained culminating point,
Miltsin, is upwards of 15,000 feet above the level of the sea, or equal
to the highest peaks of the Pyrenees.The Maroquine portion of the Atlas
contains its highest peaks, which stretch from the east of Tripoli to
the Atlantic Ocean, at Santa Cruz; and we find no mountains of equal
height, except in the tenth degree of North latitude, or 18,000 miles
south, or 30,000 south, south-east.The Rif coast has a mountainous
chain of some considerable height, but the Atlantic coast offers chiefly
ridges of hills.The coasts of Morocco are not much indented, and
consequently have few ports, and these offer poor protection from the
ocean.The general surface of Morocco presents a large ridge or lock, with two
immense declivities, one sloping N.W.to the ocean, with various rivers
and streams descending from this enormous back-bone of the Atlas, and
the other fulling towards the Sahara, S.E., feeding the streams and
affluents of Wad Draha, and other rivers, which are lost in the sands of
the Desert.This shape of the country prevents the formation of those
vast _Sebhahas_, or salt lakes, so frequent in Algeria and the south of
Tunis.We are acquainted only with two lakes of fresh or sweet
water--that of Debaia, traversed by Wad Draha,--and that of
Gibel-Akhder, which Leo compares to Lake Bolsena.The height of the
mountains, and the uniformity of their <DW72>s, produce large and
numerous rivers; indeed, the most considerable of all North Africa.These rivers of the North are shortest, but have the largest volume of
water; those of the South are larger, but are nearly dry the greater
part of the year.Some abound
with fish, particularly the Shebbel, or Barbary salmon.It is neither so
rich nor so large as our salmon, and is whitefleshed; it tastes
something like herring, but is of a finer and more delicate flavour.They are abundant in the market of Mogudor.The Shebbel, converted by
the Spaniards Sabalo, is found in the Guadalquivir.The products of the soil are nearly the same as in other parts of
Barbary.On the plains, or in the open country, the great cultivation is
wheat and barley; in suburban districts, vegetables and fruits are
propagated.In a commercial point of view, the North exports cattle,
grain, bark, leeches, and skins; and the South exports gums, almonds,
ostrich-feathers, wax, wool, and skins, as principle staple produce.When the rains cease or fail, the cultivation is kept up by irrigation,
and an excellent variety of fruits and esculent vegetables are produced;
indeed, nearly all the vegetables and fruit-trees of Southern Europe are
here abundantly and successfully cultivated, besides those peculiar to
an African clime and soil.In the south, grows a tree peculiar to this
country, the Eloeondenron Argan, so called from its Arabic name Argan.This tree produces fruit resembling the olive, whose egg-shaped, brown,
smooth and very hard stone, encloses a flat almond, of a white colour,
and of a very disagreeable taste, which, when crushed, produces a rancid
oil, used commonly as a substitute for olive-oil.The tree itself is
bushy and large, and sometimes grows of the size to a wide-spreading
oak.Not far from Mogador are several Argan forests.The level country
of the north is covered with forests of dwarfish oak; some bear sweet,
and others bitter acorns, and also the cork-tree, whose bark is a
considerable object of commerce.In the Atlas, has been found the
magnificent cedar of Lebanon.This tree has also been met with in
Algeria, but only on the mountains, some forty thousand feet above the
level of the sea.In the South there is, of course, growing in all its Saharan vigour, the
noble date-palm, and by its side, squats the palmetto, or dwarf-palm (in
Arabic _dauma_).Of trees and plants, the usual tinzah, and snouber or
pine of Aleppo, are used for preparing the fine leathers of Morocco.Many plants are also deleteriously employed for exciting intoxication,
or inflaming the passions.Morocco has its mines of gold, silver, lead, iron, tin, sulphur,
mineral, salt, and antimony; but nearly all are neglected, or unworked.Government will not encourage the industry of the people, for fear of
exciting the cupidity of foreigners.A Frenchman, a short time ago,
reported a silver mine in the south, and Government immediately bribed
him to make another statement that there was no such mine.At Elala and
Stouka, in the province of Sous, are several rich silver mines.Gold is
found in the Atlas and the Lower Sous.But this country is especially
rich in copper mines.A great number of ancient and modern authors speak
of these mines, which are situate in the mountainous country comprised
between Aghadir, Morocco, Talda, Tamkrout, and Akka.The mines most
worked, are those of Tedsi and Afran.At the foot of the Atlas, near
Taroudant, is a great quantity of sulphur.In the neighbourhood of
Morocco, saltpetre is found.In the province of Abda is an extensive
salt lake, and salt has been exported from this country to Timbuctoo.Of
precious stones, some fine specimens of amethyst have been discovered.There are scarcely any animals peculiar to Morocco, or which are not
found in other parts of North Africa.Davidson mentions some curious
facts relative to the desert horse; "_sherb-errech_, wind-bibber, or
drinker of the wind," a variety of this animal, which is not to be met
with in the Saharan regions of Tunis, or Tripoli.This horse is fed only on camel's milk, and is principally used for
hunting ostriches, which are run down by it, and then captured.[16] The
_sherb-errech_ will continue running three or four days together without
any food.It is a slight and spare-formed animal, mostly in wretched
condition, with ugly thick legs, and devoid of beauty as a horse.Division of Morocco into kingdoms or States, and zones or regions.--

such divisions scarcely exist in the administration of the native
princes.The ancient division mentioned by Leo was that of two large
provinces of Morocco and Fez, separated by the river Bouragrag, which
empties itself into the sea between Rabat and Salee; and, indeed, for
several centuries, these districts were separated and governed by
independent princes.Tafilett always, and Sous occasionally, were united
to Morocco, while Fez itself formed a powerful kingdom, extending itself
eastward as far as the gates of Tlemsen.The modern division adopted by several authors, is--

Northern, or the kingdom of Fez.Eastern, or the Province of Tafilett.Some add to this latter, the Province of Draha.Then, a great number of districts are enumerated as comprehended in
these large and general divisions; but the true division of all
Mussulman States is into tribes.There is besides another, which more
approaches to European government, viz, into kaidats, or jurisdictions.The name of a district is usually that of its chief tribe, and mountains
are denominated after the tribes that inhabit them.There is, of course,
a natural division, sometimes called a dividing into zones or specific
regions, which has already been alluded to in enumerating the natural
resources of Morocco, and which besides corresponds with the present
political divisions.I. The North of the Atlas: coming first, the Rif, or mountainous region,
which borders the Mediterranean from the river Moulwia to Tangier,
comprising the districts of Hashbat west, and Gharet and Aklaia east.Then the intermediate zone of plains and hills, which extends from the
middle course of the Moulwia to Tangier on one coast, and to Mogador on
the other.The Central Region, or the great chain of the Atlas.The Deren [17]
of the natives, from the frontiers of Algeria east to Cape Gheer, on the
south-west.This includes the various districts of the Gharb, Temsna,
Beni Hasan, Shawia, Fez, Todla, Dukala, Shragno, Abda, Haha, Shedma,
Khamna, Morocco, &c.

III.South of the Atlas: or quasi-Saharan region, comprising the various
provinces and districts of Sous, Sidi Hisham, Wadnoun, Guezoula, Draha
(Draa), Tafilett, and a large portion of the Sahara, south-east of the
Atlas.As to statistics of population I am inclined fully to admit the
statement of Signor Balbi that, the term of African statistics ought to
be rejected as absurd.Count Hemo de Graeberg, who was a long time Consul
at Tangier, and wrote a statistical and geographical account of the
empire of Morocco, states the number of the inhabitants of the town of
Mazagran to be two thousand.Elton who resided there several months,
assured me it does not contain more than one hundred.Another gentleman
who dwelt there says, three hundred.This case is a fair sample of the
style in which the statistics of population in Morocco are and have been
calculated.Before the occupation of Algeria by the French, all the cities were
vulgarly calculated at double, or treble their amount of population.This has also been the case even in India, where we could obtain, with
care, tolerably correct statistics.The prejudices of oriental and
Africo-eastern people are wholly set against statistics, or numbering
the population.No mother knows the age of her own child.It is
ill-omened, if not an affront, to ask a man how many children he has;
and to demand the amount of the population of a city, is either
constructed as an infringement upon the prerogative of the omnipotent
Creator, who knows how many people he creates, and how to take care of
them, or it is the question of a spy, who is seeking to ascertain the
strength or weakness of the country.Europeans can, therefore, rarely
obtain any correct statistical information in Morocco: all is proximate
and conjectural.[18] I am anxious, nevertheless, to give some
particulars respecting the population, in order that we may really have
a proximate idea of the strength and resources of this important
country.In describing the towns and cities of the various provinces, I
shall divide them into,

1.Other towns and remarkable places in the interior [19].The towns and ports, on the Mediterranean, are of considerable interest,
but our information is very scanty, except as far as relates to the
_praesidios_ of Spain, or the well-known and much frequented towns of
Tetuan and Tangier.Near the mouth of the Malwia (or fifteen miles distant), is the little
town of Kalat-el-wad, with a castle in which the Governor resides.Whether the river is navigable up to this place, I have not been able to
discover.The water-communication of the interior of North Africa is not
worth the name.Zaffarinds or Jafarines, are three isles lying off the
west of the river Mulweeah, at a short distance, or near its mouth.These belong to Spain, and have recently been additionally fortified,
but why, or for what reason, is not so obvious.Opposite to them, there
is said to be a small town, situate on the mainland.The Spaniards, in
the utter feebleness and decadence of their power, have lately dubbed
some one or other "Captain-general of the Spanish possessions, &c. in
North Africa."Melilla or Melilah is a very ancient city, founded by the Carthaginians,
built near a cape called by the Romans, _Rusadir_ (now Tres-Forcas) the
name afterwards given to the city, and which it still retains in the
form of Ras-ed-Dir, (Head of the mountain).This town is the capital of
the province of Garet, and is said to contain 3,000 souls.It is situate
amidst a vast tract of fine country, abounding in minerals, and most
delicious honey, from which it is pretended the place receives its name.On an isle near, and joined to the mainland by a draw-bridge, is the
Spanish _praesidio_, or convict-settlement called also Melilla,
containing a population of 2,244 according to the Spanish, but Rabbi and
Graeberg do not give it more than a thousand.At a short distance,
towards the east, is an exceedingly spacious bay, of twenty-two miles in
circumference, where, they say, a thousand ships of war could be
anchored in perfect safety, and where the ancient galleys of Venice
carried on a lucrative trade with Fez.Within the bay, three miles
inland, are the ruins of the ancient city of Eazaza, once a celebrated
place.Alhucemos, is another small island and _praesidio_ of the Spaniards,
containing five or six hundred inhabitants; it commands the bay of the
same name, and is situate at the mouth of the river Wad Nechor, where
there is also the Islet of Ed-Housh.Near the bay, is the ancient
capital, Mezemma, now in ruins; it had, however, some commercial
importance in the times of Louis XIV., and carried on trade with France.Penon de Velez is the third _praesidio_-island, a convict settlement of
the Spaniards on this coast, and a very strong position, situate
opposite the mouths of the river Gomera, which disembogues in the
Mediterranean.So
far as natural resources are concerned, Penon de Velez is a mere rock,
and a part of the year is obliged to be supplied with fresh water from
the mainland.Immediately opposite to the continent is the city of
Gomera (or Badis), the ancient Parientina, or perhaps the Acra of
Ptolemy, afterwards called Belis, and by the Spaniards, Velez de la
Gomera.The name Gomera, according to J.A.Conde, is derived from the
celebrated Arab tribe of the Gomeres, who flourished in Africa and Spain
until the last Moorish kings of Granada.Count Graberg pretends Gomera
now contains three thousand inhabitants!whilst other writers, and of
later date, represent this ancient city, which has flourished and played
an important part through many ages, as entirely abandoned, and the
abode of serpents and hyaenas.Gellis is a small port, six miles east of
Velez de Gomera.Tegaza is a small town and port, at two miles or less from the sea near
Pescadores Point, inhabited mostly by fishermen, and containing a
thousand souls.The provinces of Rif and Garet, containing these maritime towns are rich
and highly cultivated, but inhabited by a warlike and semi-barbarous
race of Berbers, over whom the Emperor exercises an extremely precarious
authority.Among these tribes, Abd-el-Kader sought refuge and support
when he was obliged to retire from Algeria, and, where he defied all the
power of the Imperial government for several months.Had the Emir
chosen, he could have remained in Rif till this time; but he determined
to try his strength with the Sultan in a pitch battle, which should
decide his fate.The savage Rifians assemble for barter and trade on market-days, which
are occasions of fierce and incessant quarrels among themselves, when it
is not unusual for two or three persons to be left dead on the spot.Should any unfortunate vessel strike on these coasts, the crew find
themselves in the hands of inhuman wreckers.No European traveller has
ever visited these provinces, and we may state positively that
journeying here is more dangerous than in the farthest wastes of the
Sahara.Spanish renegades, however, are found among them, who have
escaped from the _praesidios_, or penal settlements.The Rif country is
full of mines, and is bounded south by one of the lesser chains of the
Atlas running parallel with the coast.Forests of cork clothe the
mountain-<DW72>s; the Berbers graze their herds and flocks in the deep
green valleys, and export quantities of skins.Tetuan, the Yagath of the Romans, situate at the opening of the Straits
of Gibraltar, four or five miles from the sea, upon the declivity of a
hill and within two small ranges of mountains, is a fine, large, rich
and mercantile city of the province of Hasbat.It has a resident
governor of considerable power and consequence, the name of the present
functionary being Hash-Hash, who has long held the appointment, and
enjoys great influence near the Sultan.Half a mile east of the city
passes from the south Wad Marteen, (the Cus of Marmol) which disembogues
into the sea; on its banks is the little port of Marteen or Marteel, not
quite two miles distant from the coast, and about three from the city,
where a good deal of commerce is carried on, small vessels, laden with
the produce of Barbary, sailing thence to Spain, Gibraltar, and even
France and Italy.The population of Tetouan is from nine to twelve
thousand souls, including, besides Moors and Arabs, four thousand Jews,
two thousand <DW64>s, and eight thousand Berbers.The streets are
generally formed into arcades, or covered bazaars.The Jews have a separate quarter; their women are celebrated for their
beauty.The suburbs are adorned with fine gardens, and olive and vine
plantations.Orange groves, or rather orange forests, extend for miles
around, yielding their golden treasures.A great export of oranges could
be established here, which might be conveyed overland to India.Altogether, Tetuan is one of the most respectable coast-cities of
Morocco, though it has no port immediately adjoining it.Its
fortifications are only strong enough to resist the attack of hostile
Berbers.The town is about two-thirds of a day's journey from Tangier,
south-east.A fair day's journey would be, in Morocco, upwards of thirty
English miles, but a good deal depends upon the season of the year when
you travel.Ceuta is considered to be Esilissa of Ptolemy, and was once the capital
of Mauritania Tingitana.The Arabs call it Sebat and Sebta, _i.e._,
"seven," after the Romans, who called it _Septem fratres_, and the
Greeks the same, apparently on account of the seven mountains, which are
in the neighbourhood.Ceuta, or Sebta, is evidently the modern form of
this classic name.It is a very ancient city and celebrated fortress,
situate fourteen miles south of Gibraltar, nearly opposite to it, as a
species of rival stronghold, and placed upon a peninsula, which detaches
itself from the continent on the east, and turns then to the north.The
city extends over the tongue of land nearest the continent; the citadel
occupies Monte-del-Acho, called formerly Jibel-el-Mina, a name still
preserved in Almina, a suburb to the south-east.In the beginning of the eighth century, Ceuta, which was inhabited by
the Goths, passed into the hands of the Arabs, who made it a point of
departure for the expeditions into Spain.It was conquered by the
powerful Arab family of the Ben-Hamed, one of whom, called Mohammed
Edris, invaded Spain, and, after several conquests, was proclaimed King
of Cordova, in A.D.1,000,

On 21st of August, 1415, the Portuguese conquered it, and it was the
first place which they occupied in Africa.In 1578, at the death of Don
Sebastian, Ceuta passed with Portugal and the rest of the colonies into
the power of Spain; and when, in 1640, the Portuguese recovered their
independence, the Spaniards were left masters of Ceuta, which continues
still in their hands, but is of no utility to them except as a
_praesidio_, which makes the fourth penal settlement possessed by them
on this coast.Ceuta contains a garrison of two or three thousand men.The free
population amounts to some five or six thousand.It has a small and
insecure port.Here is the famed Gibel Zaterit, "Monkey's promontory,"
or "Ape's Hill," which has occasioned the ingenious fable, that,
inasmuch as there are no monkeys in any part of Europe except Gibraltar,
directly opposite to this rock, where also monkeys are found, there must
necessarily be a subterranean passage beneath the sea, by which they
pass and re-pass to opposite sides of the Straits, and maintain a
friendly and uninterrupted intercourse between the brethren of Africa
and Europe.Anciently, the mountains hereabouts formed the African
pillars of Hercules opposite to Gibraltar, which may be considered the
European pillar of that respectable hero of antiquity.Passing Tangier after a day's journey, we come to Arzila or Asila, in
the province of Hasbat, which is an ancient Berber city, and which, when
conquered by the Romans, was named first Zilia and afterwards Zulia,
_Constantia Zilis_.It is placed on the naked shores of the Atlantic,
and has a little port.Whilst possessed by the Portuguese, it was a
place of considerable strength, but its fortifications being, as usual,
neglected by the Moors, are now rapidly decaying.[20] The population is
about one thousand.The next
town on the Atlantic, after another day's journey southwards, is El
Araish, _i.e._, the trellices of vines; vulgarly called Laratsh.This
city replaces the ancient Liscas or Lixus and Lixa, whose ruins are
near.The Arabs call it El-Araish Beai-Arous, _i.e._, the vineyards of
the Beni-Arous, a powerful tribe, who populate the greater part of the
district of Azgar, of which it is the capital and the residence of the
Governor.It was, probably, built by this tribe about 1,200 or 1,300,
AD.El-Araish contains a population of 2,700 Moors, and 1,300 Jews, or
4,000 souls; but others give only 2,000 for the whole amount, of which
250 are Jews.The town is situate upon
a small promontory stretching into the sea, and along the mouth of the
river Cos, or Luccos (Loukkos), which forms a secure port, but of so
difficult access, that vessels of two hundred tons can scarcely enter
it.In winter, the roadstead is very bad; [21] the houses are
substantially built; and the fortifications are good, because made by
the Spaniards, who captured this place in 1610, but it was re-taken by
Muley Ishmael in 1689.In the
environs, cotton is cultivated, and charcoal is made from the Araish
forest of cork-trees.El-Araish exports cork, wool, skins, bark, beans,
and grain, and receives in exchange iron, cloth, cottons, muslins, sugar
and tea.The lions and panthers of the mountains of Beni Arasis
sometimes descend to the plains to drink, or carry off a supper of a
sheep or bullock.Azgar, the name of this district, connects it with one
of the powerful tribes of the Touaricks; and, probably, a section of
this tribe of Berbers were resident here at a very early period (at the
same time the Berber term _ayghar_ corresponds to the Arabic _bahira_,
and signifies "plain.")The ancient Lixus deserves farther mention on account of the interest
attached to its coins, a few of which remain, although but very recently
deciphered by archeologists.There are five classes of them, and all
Phoenician, although the city now under Roman rule, represents the
vineyard riches of this part of ancient Mauritania by two bunches of
grapes, so that, after nearly three thousand years, the place has
retained its peculiarity of producing abundant vines, El-Araish, being
"the vine trellices;" others have stamped on them "two ears of corn" and
"two fishes," representing the fields of corn waving on the plains of
Morocco, and the fish (shebbel especially) which fills its northern
rivers.Strabo says:--"Mauritania generally, excepting a small part desert, is
rich and fertile, well watered with rivers and washed with lakes;
abounding in all things, and producing trees of great dimensions."Another writer adds "this country produces a species of the vine whose
trunk the extended arms of two men cannot embrace, and which yields
grapes of a cubit's length.""At this city," says Pliny, "was the palace
of Antaeus, and his combat with Hercules and the gardens of Hesperides."Mehedia or Mamora, and sometimes, Nuova Mamora, is situate upon the
north-western <DW72> of a great hill, some four feet above the sea, upon
the left bank of the mouth of the Sebon, and at the edge of the
celebrated plain and forest of Mamora, belonging to the province of
Beni-Hassan.According to Marmol, Mamora was built by Jakob-el-Mansour
to defend the embouchure of the river.It was captured by the Spaniards
in 1614, and retaken by the Moors in 1681.The Corsairs formerly took
refuge here.It is now a weak and miserable place, commanded by an old
crumbling-down castle.There are five or six hundred fishermen,
occupying one hundred and fifty cabins, who make a good trade of the
Shebbel salmon; it has a very small garrison.The forest of Mamora,
contains about sixty acres of fine trees, among which are some splendid
oaks, all suitable for naval construction.Salee or Sala, a name which this place bore antecedently to the Roman
occupation, is a very ancient city, situate upon the right bank of the
river Bouragrag, and near its mouth.This place was captured in 1263, by
Alphonso the Wise, King of Castille, who was a short time after
dispossessed of his conquest by the King of Fez; and the Moorish Sultans
have kept it to the present time, though the city itself has often
attempted to throw off the imperial yoke.The modern Salee is a large
commercial and well-fortified city of the province of Beni-Hassan.Its
port is sufficiently large, but, on account of the little depth of
water, vessels of large burden cannot enter it.The houses and public
places are tolerably well-built.The town is fortified by a battery of
twenty-four pieces of cannon fronting the sea, and a redoubt at the
entrance of the river.What navy the Maroquines have, is still laid up
here, but the dock-yard is now nearly deserted, and the few remaining
ships are unserviceable.The population, all of whom are Mahometans, are
now, as in Corsair times, the bitterest and most determined enemies of
Christians, and will not permit a Christian or Jew to reside among them.The amount of this population, and that of Rabat, is thus given,

  _Salee Rabat_
  Graeberg         23,000    27,000
  Washington       9,000    21,000
  Arlett          14,000    24,000

but it is probably greatly exaggerated.A resident of this country reduces the population of Salee as low as two
or three thousand.For many years, the port of Salee was the rendezvous
of the notorious pirates of Morocco, who, together with the city of
Rabat, formed a species of military republic almost independent of the
Sultan; these Salee rovers were at once the most ferocious and
courageous in the world.Time was, when these audacious freebooters lay
under Lundy Island in the British Channel, waiting to intercept British
traders!"Salee," says Lempriere, "was a place of good commerce, till,
addicting itself entirely to piracy, and revolting from the allegiance
to its Sovereign, Muley Zidan, that prince in the year 1648, dispatched
an embassy to King Charles 1, of England, requesting him to send a
squadron of men-of-war to lie before the town, while he attacked by
land."This request being acceded to, the city was soon reduced, the
fortifications demolished, and the leaders of the rebellion put to
death.The year following, the Emperor sent another ambassador to
England, with a present of Barbary horses and three hundred Christian
slaves.Rabat, or Er-Rabat, and on some of the foreign maps Nuova Sale, is a
modern city of considerable extent, densely populated, strong and
well-built, belonging to the province of Temsna.It is situated on the
declivity of a hill, opposite to Salee, on the other side of the river,
or left side of the Bouragrag, which is as broad as the Thames at
London Bridge, and might be considered as a great suburb, or another
quarter of the same city.It was built by the famous Yakob-el-Mansour,
nephew of Abd-el-Moumen, and named by him Rabat-el-Fatah, _i.e._, "camp
of victory," by which name it is now often mentioned.The walls of Rabat enclose a large space of ground, and the town is
defended on the seaside by three forts, erected some years ago by an
English renegade, and furnished with ordnance from Gibraltar.Among the
population are three or four thousand Jews, some of them of great wealth
and consequence.The merchants are active and intelligent, carrying on
commerce with Fez, and other places of the interior, as also with the
foreign ports of Genoa, Gibraltar, and Marseilles.In the middle ages,
the Genoese had a great trade with Rabat, but this trade is now removed
to Mogador, Many beautiful gardens and plantations adorn the suburbs,
deserving even the name of "an earthly paradise."The Moors of Rabat are mostly from Spain, expelled thence by the
Spaniards.The famous Sultan, Almanzor, intended that Rabat should be
his capital.His untenanted mausoleum is placed here, in a separate and
sacred quarter.This prince, surnamed "the victorious," (Elmansor,) was
he who expelled the Moravedi from Spain.He is the Nero of Western
Africa, as Keatinge says, their "King Arthur."Tradition has it that
Elmansor went in disguise to Mecca, and returned no more.Mankind love
this indefinite and obscure end of their heroes.Moses went up to the
mountain to die there in eternal mystery.At a short distance from Rabat
is Shella, or its ruins, a small suburb situated on the summit of a
hill, which contains the tombs of the royal family of the Beni-Merini,
and the founder of Rabat, and is a place of inviolate sanctity, no
infidel being permitted to enter therein.Monsieur Chenier supposes
Shella to have been the site of the metropolis of the Carthaginian
colonies.Of these two cities, on the banks of the Wad-Bouragrag, Salee was,
according to D'Anville, always a place of note as at the present time,
and the farthest Roman city on the coast of the Atlantic, being the
frontier town of the ancient Mauritania Tingitana.Some pretend that all
the civilization which has extended itself beyond this point is either
Moorish, or derived from European colonists.The river Wad-Bouragrag is
somewhat a natural line of demarcation, and the products and animals of
the one side differ materially from those of the other, owing to the
number and less rapid descent of the streams on the side of the north,
and so producing more humidity, whilst the south side, on the contrary,
is of a higher and drier soil.Fidallah, or Seid Allah, _i.e_., "grace," or "gift of God," is a
maritime village of the province of Temsa, founded by the Sultan
Mohammed in 1773.It is a strong place, and surrounded with walls.Fidallah is situated on a vast plain, near the river Wad Millah, where
there is a small port, or roadstead, to which the corsairs were wont to
resort when they could not reach Salee, long before the village was
built, called Mersa Fidallah.The place contains a thousand souls,
mostly in a wretched condition.Sidi Mohammed, before he built Mogador,
had the idea of building a city here; the situation is indeed
delightful, surrounded with fertility.Dar-el-Beida (or Casa-Blanco, "white house,") is a small town, formerly
in possession of the Portuguese, who built it upon the ruins of Anfa or
Anafa, [22] which they destroyed in 1468.They, however, scarcely
finished it when they abandoned it in 1515.Dar-el-Beida is situate on
the borders of the fertile plains of the province of Shawiya, and has a
small port, formed by a river and a spacious bay on the Atlantic.The
Romans are said to have built the ancient Anafa, in whose time it was a
considerable place, but now it scarcely contains above a thousand
inhabitants, and some reduce them to two hundred.Sidi Mohammed
attempted this place, and the present Sultan endeavoured to follow up
these efforts.A little commerce with Europe is carried on here.The bay
will admit of vessels of large burden anchoring in safety, except when
the wind blows strong from the north-west.Casa Blanco is two days
journey from Rabat, and two from Azamor, or Azemmour, which is an
ancient and fine city of the province of Dukaila, built by the Amazigh
Berbers, in whose language it signifies "olives."It is situate upon a
hill, about one hundred feet above the sea, and distant half a mile from
the shore, not far from the mouth of the Wad-Omm-er-Rbia (or Omm-Erbegh)
on its southern bank, and is everywhere surrounded by a most fertile
soil.Azamor contains now about eight or nine hundred inhabitants, but
formerly was much more populated.The Shebbel salmon is the principal
commerce, and a source of immense profit to the town.The river is very
deep and rapid, so that the passage with boats is both difficult and
dangerous.It is frequently of a red colour, and charged with slime like
the Nile at the period of its inundations.The tide is felt five or six
leagues up the river, according to Chenier.Formerly, vessels of every
size entered the river, but now its mouth has a most difficult bar of
sand, preventing large vessels going up, like nearly all the Maroquine
ports situate on the mouths, or within the rivers.Azamor was taken by the Portuguese under the command of the Duke of
Braganza in 1513 who strengthened it by fortifications, the walls of
which are still standing; but it was abandoned a century afterwards, the
Indies having opened a more lucrative field of enterprise than these
barren though honourable conquests on the Maroquine coast.This place is
half a day's journey, or about fourteen miles from Mazagran, _i.the
above Amayeeghs, an extremely ancient and strong castle, erected on a
peninsula at the bottom of a spacious and excellent bay.It was rebuilt
by the Portuguese in 1506, who gave it the name of Castillo Real.The
site has been a centre of population from the remotest period, chiefly
Berbers, whose name it still bears.The Arabs, however, call it
El-Bureeja, i.e., "the citadel."The Portuguese abandoned it in 1769;
Mazagran was the last stronghold which they possessed in Morocco.The
town is well constructed, and has a wall twelve feet thick, strengthened
with bastions.There is a small port, or dock, on the north side of the
town, capable of admitting small vessels, and the roadstead is good,
where large vessels can anchor about two miles off the shore.Its
traffic is principally with Rabat, but there is also some export trade
to foreign parts.[23] After
proceeding two days south-west, you arrive at Saffee, or properly
Asafee, called by the natives Asfee, and anciently Soffia or Saffia, is
a city of great antiquity, belonging to the province of Abda, and was
built by the Carthaginians near Cape Pantin.Its site lies between two
hills, in a valley which is exposed to frequent inundations.The
roadstead of Saffee is good and safe during summer, and its shipping
once enabled it to be the centre of European commerce on the Atlantic
coast.The population amounts to about one thousand, including a number
of miserable Jews.The walls of Saffee are massy and high.The
Portuguese captured this city in 1508, voluntarily abandoning it in
1641.The country around is not much cultivated, and presents melancholy
deserts; but there is still a quantity of corn grown.About forty miles
distant, S.E., is a large salt lake.Saffee is one and a half day's
journey from Mogador.Equidistant between Mazagran and Saffee is the small town of El-Waladia,
situate on an extensive plain.Persons report that near this spot is a
spacious harbour, or lagune, sufficiently capacious to contain four or
five hundred sail of the line; but, unfortunately, the entrance is
obstructed by some rocks, which, however, it is added, might easily be
blown up.The lagune is also exposed to winds direct for the ocean.The
town, enclosed within a square wall, and containing very few
inhabitants, is supposed to have been built in the middle of the
seventeenth century by the Sultan Waleed.This brings us to Mogador, which, with Aghadir, have already been
described.CHAPTER V.

Description of the Imperial Cities or Capitals of the Empire.--
El-Kesar.--Mequinez.--Fez.--Morocco.--The province of Tafilett, the
birth-place of the present dynasty of the Shereefs.The royal or capitals of the interior now demand our attention, which
are El-Kesar, Mequinez, Fez, and Morocco.El-Kesar, or Al-Kesar, [24] styled also El-Kesue-Kesar, is so named and
distinguished because it owes its enlargement to the famous Sultan of
Fez, Almansor, who improved and beautified it about the year 1180, and
designed this city as a magazine and rendezvous of troops for the great
preparations he was making at the time for the conquest of Granada.El-Kesar is in the province of the Gharb, and situate on the southern
bank of the Luccos; here is a deep and rapid stream, flowing W.The town is nearly as large as Tetuan, but the streets are dirty and
narrow, and many of the houses in a ruinous condition, This fortified
place was once adorned by some fifteen mosques, but only two or three
are now fit for service.The population does not exceed four or five
thousand souls, and some think this number over-estimated.The surrounding country is flat meadowland, but flooded after the rains,
and producing fatal fevers, though dry and hot enough in summer.The
suburban fields are covered with gardens and orchards.It was at
El-Kesar, where, in A.D.1578, the great battle of The Three Kings came
off, because, besides the Portuguese King, Don Sebastian, two Moorish
princes perished on this fatal day.But one of them, Muley Moluc, died
very ill in a litter, and was not killed in the fight; his death,
however, was kept a secret till the close of the battle, in order that
the Moors might not be discouraged.With their prince, Don Sebastian,
perished the flower of the Portuguese nobility and chivalry of that
time.War, indeed, was found "a dangerous game" on that woeful day: both
for princes and nobles, and many a poor soul was swept away

  "Floating in a purple tide."But the "trade of war" has been carried on ever since, and these
lessons, written in blood, are as useless to mankind as those dashed off
by the harmless pen of the sentimental moralist.El-Kesar is placed in
Latitude, 35 deg.1 10" N.; Longitude, 5 deg.49' 30" W.

Mequinez, [25] in Arabic, Miknas (or Miknasa), is a royal residence, and
city of the province of Fez, situate upon a hill in the midst of a
well-watered and most pleasant town, blessed with a pure and serene air.The city of Miknas is both large and finely built, of considerable
interest and of great antiquity.It was founded by the tribe of Berbers
Meknasab, a fraction of the Zenatah, in the middle of the tenth century,
and called Miknasat, hence is derived its present name.The modern town
is surrounded with a triple wall thirteen feet high and three thick,
enclosing a spacious area.This wall is mounted with batteries to awe
the Berbers of the neighbouring mountains.The population amounts to
about twenty thousand souls, (some say forty or fifty thousand) in which
are included about nine thousand <DW64> troops, constituting the greater
portion of the Imperial guard.Two thousand of these black troops are in
charge of the royal treasures, estimated at some fifty millions of
dollars, and always increasing.These treasures consist of jewels, bars
of gold and silver, and money in the two precious metals, the greater
part being Spanish and Mexican dollars.The inhabitants are represented as being the most polished of the Moors,
kind and hospitable to strangers.The palace of the Emperor is extremely
simple and elegant, all the walls of which are _embroidered_ with the
beautiful stucco-work of Arabesque patterns, as pure and chaste as the
finest lace.The marble for the pillars was furnished from the ruins
adjacent, called Kesar Faraoun, "Castle of Pharoah" (a name given to
most of the old ruins of Morocco, of whose origin there is any doubt).During the times of piracy, there was here, as also at Morocco, a
Spanish hospitium for the ransom and recovery of Christian slaves.Even
before Mequinez was constituted a royal city, it was a place of
considerable trade and riches.Nothing of any peculiar value has been
discovered among the extensive and ancient ruins about a mile distant,
and which have furnished materials for the building of several royal
cities; they are, however, supposed to be Roman.Scarcely a day's
journey separates Mequinez from Fez.It is not usual for two royal
cities to be placed so near together, but which must render their
fortunes inseparable.According to some, the name Fas, which signifies in Arabia
a pickaxe, was given to it because one was found in digging its
foundations.Others derive it from Fetha, silver.It is no longer the
marvellous city described by Leo Africanus, yet its learning, wealth,
and industry place it in the first rank of the cities of Morocco.During
the eighth century, the Arabs, masters of Tunis, of all Algeria, and the
maritime cities of Morocco, seemed to think only of invading Europe and
consolidating their power in Spain; but at this epoch, a descendant of
Ali and Fatima, Edris Ben Abdalluh, quitted Arabia, passed into Morocco,
and established himself at Oualili, the capital, where he remained till
his death, and where he was buried.His character was generally known
and venerated for its sanctity, and drew upon him the affectionate
regard of the people, and all instinctively placed themselves near him
as a leader of the Faithful, likely to put an end to anarchy, and
establish order in the Mussulman world.His son, Edris-Ben-Edris, who
inherited his virtues and influence, offering a species of ancient
prototype to Abd-el Kader and his venerable father, Mahadin, was the
first _bona-fide_ Mussulman sovereign of the Maroquine empire, and
founded Fez.Fez is a most ancient centre of population, and had long been a famed
city, before Muley Edris, in the year A.D.807 (others in 793), gave it
its present form and character.From that period, however, Fez [26] dates its modern celebrity and rank
among the Mahometan capitals of the world, and especially as being the
second city of Islamism, and the "palace of the Mussulmen Princes of the
West."That the Spanish philologists should make Fut, of the Prophet
Nahum, to be the ancient capital of Fez, is not remarkable, considering
the numerous bands of emigrants, who, emerging from the coast, wandered
as far as the pillars of Hercules; and, besides, in a country like North
Africa, the theatre of so many revolutions, almost every noted city of
the present period has had its ancient form, from which it has been
successively changed.The modern capital is placed in a valley upon the gentle <DW72> of
several hills by which it is surrounded, and whose heights are crowned
with lovely gardens breathing odoriferous sweets.Close by is a little
river, or a branch of the Tebou, named Wad-el-Juhor, or "streamlet,"
which supplies the city with excellent water.The present buildings are divided into old and new Fez.The streets are
so narrow that two men on horseback could scarcely ride abreast; they
are, besides, very dark, and often arched over.Colonel Scott represents
some of the streets, however, as a mile in length.The houses are high,
but not handsome.The shops are numerous and much frequented, though not
very fine in appearance.Fez contains no less than seven hundred
mosques, fifty of which are superb, and ornamented with fine columns of
marble; there is, besides, a hundred or more of very small and ill-built
mosques, or rather, houses of prayer.The most famous of these temples
of worship is El-Karoubin (or El-Karouiin), supported by three hundred
pillars.In this is preserved the celebrated library of antiquity,
where, it is pretended, ancient Greek and Latin authors are to be found
in abundance with the lost books of Titus Livy.[27] But the mosque the more
frequented and venerated, is that dedicated to the founder of the city,
Muley Edris, whose ashes repose within its sacred enclosure.So
excessive is this "hero-worship" for this great sultan, that the people
constantly invoke his name in their prayers instead of that of the
Deity.The mausoleum of this sacro-santo prince is inviolable and
unapproachable.The university of Fez was formally much celebrated, but
little of its learning now remains.Its once high-minded orthodox mulahs
are now succeeded by a fanatic and ignorant race of marabouts.Nevertheless, the few _hommes de lettres_ found in Morocco are
congregated here, and the literature of the empire is concentrated in
this city.Seven large public schools are in full activity, besides
numbers of private seminaries of instruction.The low humour of the
talebs, and the fanaticism of the people, are unitedly preserved and
developed in this notorious doggerel couplet, universally diffused
throughout Morocco:--

  _Ensara fee Senara
  Elhoud fee Sefoud_

  "Christians on the hook
  Jews on the spit," or

  "Let Christians be hooked,
  And let Jews be cooked."The great division of the Arabic into eastern and western dialects makes
little real difference in a practical point of view.The Mogrebbin, or
western, is well understood by all travellers, and, of course, by all
scholars from the East.The palace of the Sultan is not large, but is handsome.There are
numerous baths, and an hospital for the mad or incurable.The population
was estimated, not long ago, at 88,000 souls, of which there were 60,000
Moors and Arabs (the Moors being chiefly immigrants from Spain), 10,000
Berbers, 8,000 Jews, and 10,000 <DW64>s.But this amount has been
reduced to 40,000, or even 30,000; and the probability is, the present
population of Fez does not by any means, exceed 50,000, if it reaches
that number.Nearly all the Jews reside in the new city, which, by its
position, dominates the old one.The inhabitants of Fez, in spite of
their learning and commerce, are distinguished for their fanaticism; and
an European, without an escort of troops, cannot walk in the streets
unless disguised.It was lately the head-quarters of the fanatics who
preached "the holy war," and involved the Emperor in hostilities with
the French.The immense trade of every kind carried on at Fez gives it almost the
air of an European city.In the great square, called Al-Kaisseriah, is
exhibited all the commerce of Europe and Africa--nay, even of the whole
world.The crowd of traffickers here assemble every day as at a fair.Fez has two annual caravans; one leaves for Central Africa, or
Timbuctoo; and another for Mecca, or the caravan of pilgrims.The two
great stations and rendezvous points of the African caravan are Tafilett
and Touat.The journey from Fez to Timbuctoo occupies about ninety days.The Mecca caravan proceeds the same route as far as Touat, and then
turns bank north-east to Ghadames, Fezzan, and Angelah, and thence to
Alexandria, which it accomplishes in four or five, to six months.All
depends on the inclination of the Shereef, or Commandant, of the
caravan; but the journey from Fez to Alexandria cannot, by the quickest
caravan, be accomplished in much less time than three months and a half,
or one hundred days.The value of the investments in this caravan has
been estimated at a million of dollars; for the faithful followers of
the Prophet believe, with us, that godliness is profitable in the life
that now is, as well as in that which is to come.Fez is surrounded with a vast wall, but which is in decay.It applies almost to every Moorish city and public building in
North Africa.And yet the faith of the false prophet is as strong as
ever, and with time and hoary age seems to strike its roots deeper into
the hearts of its simple, but enthusiastic and duped devotees!The city has seven gates, and two castles, at the east and west, form
its main defence.These castles are very ancient, and are formed and
supported by square walls about sixty feet in front, Ali Bey says,
subterraneous passages are reported to exist between these castles and
the city; and, whenever the people revolt against the Sultan, cannon are
planted on the castles with a few soldiers as their guard.The
fortifications, or Bastiles, of Paris, we see, therefore, were no new
invention of Louis Philippe to awe the populace.The maxims of a subtle
policy are instructive in despotism of every description.The constituted authorities of Fez are like those of every city of
Morocco.The Governor is the lieutenant of the sovereign, exercising the
executive power; the Kady, or supreme judge, is charged with the
administration of the law, and the Al-Motassen fixes the price of
provisions, and decides all the questions of trade and customs.There
are but few troops at Fez, for it is not a strong military possession;
on the contrary, it is commanded by accessible heights and is exposed to
a _coup-de-main_.Fez, indeed, could make no _bona-fide_ resistance to an European army.The manufactures are principally woollen haiks, silk handkerchiefs,
slippers and shoes of excellent leather, and red caps of felt, commonly
called the fez; the first fabrication of these red caps appears to have
been in this city.The Spanish Moorish immigrants introduced the mode of
dressing goat and sheep-skins, at first known by the name of Cordovan
from Cordova; but, since the Moorish forced immigration, they have
acquired the celebrated name of Morocco.The chief food of the people is
the national Moorish dish of _cuscasou_, a fine grained paste, cooked by
steam, with melted fat, oil, or other liquids poured upon the dish, and
sometimes garnished with pieces of fowl and other meat.A good deal of
animal food is consumed, but few vegetables.The climate is mild in the
winter, but suffocating with heat in the summer.This city is placed in
latittude 34 deg.6' 3" N. longitude 4 deg.Morocco, or strictly in Arabic, _Maraksh_, which signifies "adorned,"
is the capital of the South, and frequently denominated the capital of
the Empire, but it is only a _triste_ shadow of its former greatness.It
is sometimes honoured with the title of "the great city," or "country."Morocco occupies an immense area of ground, being seven miles in
circumference, the interior of which is covered with heaps of ruins or
more pleasantly converted into gardens.Morocco was built in 1072 or
1073 by the famous Yousel-Ben-Tashfin, King of Samtuna, and of the
dynasty of the Almoravedi, or Marabouts.Its site is that of an ancient
city, Martok, founded in the remotest periods of the primitive Africans,
or aboriginal Berbers, in whose language it signifies a place where
everything good and pleasant was to be found in abundance.Bocanum Hermerum of the Ancients was also near the site of this capital,
Morocco attained its greatest prosperity shortly after its foundation,
and since then it has only declined.In the twelfth century, under the
reign of Jakoub Almanzor, there were 10,000 houses and 700,000 souls,
(if indeed we can trust their statistics); but, at the present time,
there are only some forty to fifty thousand inhabitants, including 4,000
Shelouhs and 5,000 Jews.Ali Bey, in 1804, estimates its population at
only 30,000, and Captain Washington in 1830 at 80, or 100,000.This vast
city lies at the foot of the Atlas, or about fourteen miles distant,
spread over a wide and most lovely plain of the province of Rhamma,
watered by the river Tensift, six miles from the gates of the capital.The mosques are numerous and rich, the principal of which are
El-Kirtubeeah, of elegant architecture with an extremely lofty minaret;
El-Maazin, which is three hundred years old, and a magnificent building;
and Benious, built nearly seven hundred years ago of singular
construction, uniting modern and ancient architecture.The mosque of the
patron saint is Sidi Belabbess.Nine gates open in the city-walls; these
are strong and high, and flanked with towers, except on the south east
where the Sultan's palace stands.The streets are crooked, of uneven
width, unpaved, and dirty in winter, and full of dust in summer.The Kaessaria, or
commercial quarter, is extensive, exhibiting every species of
manufacture and natural product.The manufactures of this, as of other large places, are principally,
silks, embroidery, and leather.The merchants of Mogador have magazines
here; this capital has also its caravans, which trade to the interior,
passing through Wadnoun to the south.The Imperial palace is without the city and fortified with strong walls.There are large gardens attached, in one of which the Emperor receives
his merchants and the diplomatic agents.The air of the country, at the
foot of the Atlas, is pure and salubrious.The city is well supplied
with water from an aqueduct, connecting it with the river Tensift, which
flows from the gorges of the Atlas.But the inhabitants, although they
enjoy this inestimable blessing in an African climate, are not famous
for their cleanliness; Morocco, if possessing any particular character,
still must be considered as a commercial city, for its learning is at a
very low ebb.Its interior wears a deeply dejected, nay a profoundly
gloomy aspect."Horrendum incultumque specus."and the European merchants, when they come up here are glad to get away
as soon as possible.Outside the city, there is a suburb appropriated to lepers, a
Lazar-house of leprosy, which afflicting and loathsome disease descends
from father to son through unbroken generations; the afflicted cannot
enter the city, and no one dare approach their habitations.The Emperor
usually resides for a third portion of his time at Morocco the rest at
Fez and Mequinez.Whenever his Imperial Highness has anything
disagreeable with foreign European powers, he comes down from Fez to
Morocco, to get out of the way.Occasionally, he travels from town to
town of the interior, to awe by his presence the ever restless
disaflfection of the tribes, or excite their loyalty for the Shereefian
throne.35" 30', W.

Tafilett consists of a group of towns or villages, situate on the
south-eastern side of the Atlas, which may he added to the royal cities,
being inhabited in part by the Imperial family, and is the birth-place
of their sovereign power--emphatically called Beladesh-Sherfa, "country
of the Shereefs."The country was anciently called Sedjelmasa, and
retained this name up to 1530 A.D., when the principal city acquired the
apellation of Tafilett, said to be derived from an Arab immigrant,
called Filal, who improved the culture of dates, and whose name on this
account, under the Berber form of Tafilett, was given to a plantation of
dates cultivated by him, and then passed to the surrounding districts.At the present time, Tafilett consists of a group of fortified or
castle-built villages, environed by walls mounted with square towers,
which extend on both sides of the river Zig.There is also a castle, or
rather small town, upon the left side of the river, called by the
ordinary name of Kesar, which is in the hands of the Shereefs, and
inhabited entirely by the family of the Prophet.The principal and most
flourishing place was a long time called Tafilett, but is now according
to Callie, Ghourlan, and the residence of the Governor of the province
of Ressant, a town distinguished by a magnificent gateway surrounded
with various  Dutch tiles, symmetrically arranged in a diamond
pattern.This traveller calls the district of Tafilett, Afile or Afilel.It is probable that from the rains of the ancient Sedjelmasa, some of
the modern villages have been constructed.The towns and districts of
Tafilett once formed an independent kingdom.The present population has
been estimated at some ten thousand, but this is entirely conjectural.Callie mentions the four towns of Ghourlan, L'Eksebi, Sosso and Boheim
as containing eleven or twelve thousand souls.The soil of Tafilett is
level, composed of sand of an ashy grey, productive of corn, and all
sorts of European fruits and vegetables.The natives have fine sheep,
with remarkably white wool.The manufactures, which are in woollen and
silk, are called Tafiletes.Besides being a rendezvous of caravans, radiating through all parts of
the Sahara, Tafilett is a great mart of traffic in the natural products
of the surrounding countries.A fine bridge spans the Zig, built by a
Spaniard.When the Sultan of Morocco finds any portion of his family
inclined to be naughty, he sends them to Tafilett, as we are wont to
send troublesome people to "Jericho."This, at any rate, is better than
cutting off their heads, which, from time immemorial, has been the
invariable practice of African and Oriental despots.The Maroquine
princes may be thankful they have Tafilett as a place of exile.The
Emperors never visit Tafilett except as dethroned exiles.A journey to
such a place is always attended with danger; and were the Sultan to
escape, he would find, on his return, the whole country in revolt.Regarding these royal cities, we sum up our observations.The destinies
of Fez and Mequinez are inseparable.United, they contain one hundred
thousand inhabitants, the most polished and learned in the Empire.Fez
is the city of arts and learning, that is of what remains of the once
famous and profound Moorish doctors of Spain.Mequinez is the strong
place of the Empire, an emporium of arms and imperial Cretsures.The two cities are the capitals of two kingdoms,
never yet amalgamated.The present dynasty belongs not to Fez, but to
Morocco; though a dynasty of Shereefs, they are Shereefs of the south,
and African blood flows in their veins.The Sultan generally is obliged to give a preference to Fez for a
residence, because his presence is necessary to maintain the allegiance
of the north country, and to curb its powerful warparty, his son in the
meanwhile being left Governor during his absence.But all these royal
cities are on the decline, the "sere and yellow leaf" of a well nigh
defunct civilization.Morocco is a huge shell of its former greatness, a
monster of Moresque dilapidations.France may awaken the slumbering
energies of the population of these once flourishing and august cities,
but left to themselves they are powerless, sinking under their own
weight and uncouth encumbrances, and will rise no more till
reconstructed by European hands.Description of the towns and cities of the Interior, and those of the

interior, with some other remarkable places.First, these distinguished and well ascertained places in the kingdom of
Fez.Seisouan, or Sousan, is the capital of the Rif province, situate also on
the borders of the province of the Habat, and by the sources of a little
river which runs into the Mediterranean, near Cape Mazari.The town is
small, but full of artizans and merchants.The country around is
fertile, being well irrigated with streams.Sousan is the most
beautifully picturesque of all the Atlas range.Sofou, or Sofron, is a fine walled city, southeast of Fez, situate upon
the river Guizo; in a vast and well-watered plain near, are rich mines
of fossil salt.Wazen, or Wazein, in the province of Azgar, and the region of the Gharb,
is a small city without Walls, celebrated for being the residence of
the High Priest, or Grand Marabout of the Empire.This title is
hereditary, and is now (or up to lately) possessed by the famous
Sidi-el-Haj-el-Araby-Ben-Ali, who, in his district, lives in a state of
nearly absolute independence, besides exercising great influence over
public affairs.This saint, or priest, has, however, a rival at Tedda.The two popes together pretend to decide the fate of the Empire.The
districts where these Grand Marabouts reside, are without governors,
and the inhabitants pay no tribute into the imperial coffers, they are
ruled by their two priests under a species of theocracy.The Emperor
never attempts or dares to contest their privileges.Occasionally they
appear abroad, exciting the people, and declaiming against the vices of
the times.His Moorish Majesty then feels himself ill at ease, until
they retire to their sanctuaries, and employs all his arts to effect
the object, protesting that he will be wholly guided by their councils
in the future administration of the Empire.With this humiliation of
the Shereefs, they are satisfied, and kennel themselves into their
sanctum-sanctorums.Zawiat-Muley-Driss, which means, retirement of our master, Lord Edris
(Enoch) and sometimes called Muley Edris, is a far famed city of the
province of Fez, and placed at the foot of the lofty mountains of
Terhoun, about twenty-eight miles from Fez, north-west, amidst a most
beautiful country, producing all the necessaries and luxuries of human
life.The site anciently called Tuilet, was perhaps also the Volubilis
of the ancients.Here is a sanctuary dedicated to the memory of Edris,
progenitor and founder of the dynasty of Edrisiti.The population, given by Graeberg, is nine thousand, but this is
evidently exaggerated.Not far off, towards the west, are some
magnificent ruins of an ancient city, called Kesar Faraoun, or "Castle
of Pharoah."Dubdu, called also Doubouton, is an ancient, large city, of the district
of Shaous, and once the residence of an independent prince, but now
fallen into decay on account of the sterility of its site, which is upon
the sides of a barren mountain.Dubdu is three days' journey southeast
of Fez, and one day from Taza, in the region of the Mulweeah.Taza is
the capital of the well-watered district of Haiaina, and one of the
finest cities in Morocco, in a most romantic situation, placed on a rock
which is shaped like an island, and in presence of the lofty mountains
of Zibel Medghara, to the south-west.Perhaps it is the Babba of the
ancients; a river runs round the town.The houses and streets are
spacious, and there is a large mosque.The air is pure, and provisions
are excellent.The population is estimated at ten or twelve thousand,
who are hospitable, and carry on a good deal of commerce with Tlemsen
and Fez.Taza is two days from Fez, and four from Oushda.Oushda is the well-known frontier town, on the north-east, which
acquired some celebrity during the late war.It is enclosed by the walls
of its gardens, and is protected by a large fortress.The place contains
a population of from six hundred to one thousand Moors and Arabs.There
is a mosque, as well as three chapels, dedicated to Santous.The houses,
built of clay, are low and of a wretched appearance; the streets are
winding, and covered with flints.The fortress, where the Kaed resides,
is guarded in ordinary times by a dozen soldiers; but, were this force
increased, it could not be defended, in consequence of its dilapidated
condition.A spring of excellent water, at a little distance from
Oushda, keeps up the whole year round freshness and verdure in the
gardens, by means of irrigation.Oushda is a species of oasis of the Desert of Angad, and the aridity of
the surrounding country makes these gardens appear delicious, melons,
olives, and figs being produced in abundance.The distance between Tlemsen and Oushda is sixteen leagues, or about
sixteen hours' march for troops; Oushda is also four or five days from
Oran, and six days from Fez.The Desert commences beyond the Mulweeah,
at more than forty leagues from Tlemsen.Like the Algerian Angad, which
extends to the south of Tlemsen, it is of frightful sterility,
particularly in summer.In this season, one may march for six or eight
hours without finding any water.It is impossible to carry on military
operations in such a country during summer.On this account, Marshal
Bugeaud soon excavated Oushda and returned to the Tlemsen territory.Aghla is a town, or rather large village, of the district of Fez, where
the late Muley Suleiman occasionally resided.It is situated along the
river Wad Vergha, in a spacious and well-cultivated district.A great
market of cattle, wool, and bees'-wax, is held in the neighbourhood.The
country abounds in lions; but, it is pretended, of such a cowardly race,
that a child can frighten them away.Hence the proverb addressed to a
pusillanimous individual, "You are as brave as the lions of Aghla, whose
tails the calves eat."The Arabs certainly do occasionally run after
lions with sticks, or throw stones at them, as we are accustomed to
throw stones at dogs.Nakhila, _i.e._, "little palm," is a little town of the province of
Temsna, placed in the river Gueer; very ancient, and formerly rich and
thickly populated.A great mart, or souk, is annually held at this
place.It is the site of the ancient Occath.Meshru Khaluf, _i.e._, "ford, or watering-place of the wild-boar," in
the district of the Beni-Miskeen, is a populated village, and situated
on the right bank of the Ovad Omm-Erbergh, lying on the route of many of
the chief cities.Here is the ford of Meshra Khaluf, forty-five feet
wide, from which the village derives its name.On the map will be seen many places called Souk.The interior tribes
resort thither to purchase and exchange commodities.The market-places
form groups of villages.It is not a part of my plan to give any
particular description of them.Second, those places distinguished in the kingdom of Morocco, including
Sous, Draha, and Tafilett.Tefza, a Berber name, which, according to some, signifies "sand," and to
others, "a bundle of straw," is the capital of the province of Todla,
built by the aborigines on the <DW72> of the Atlas, who surrounded it
with a high wall of sandstone (called, also, Tefza.)At two miles east
of this is the smaller town of Efza, which is a species of suburb,
divided from Tefza by the river Derna.The latter place is inhabited
certainly by Berbers, whose women are famous for their woollen works and
weaving.Tefza is also celebrated for its native black and white woollen
manufactures.The population of the two places is stated at upwards of
10,000, including 2,000 Jews.Pitideb, or Sitideb, is another fine town in the neighbourhood, built by
the Amazirghs on the top of a high mountain.The inhabitants are
esteemed the most civilized of their nation, and governed by their own
elders and chiefs, they live in a state of almost republican
independence.Some good native manufactures are produced, and a large
commerce with strangers is carried on.The women are reputed as being
extremely fair and fascinating.Ghuer, or Gheu, (War, _i.e._, "difficult?")is a citadel, or rather a
strong, massive rock, and the most inaccessible of all in Morocco,
forming a portion of the mountains of Jedla, near the sources of the Wad
Omm-Erbegh.This rocky fort is the residence of the supreme Amrgar, or
chief of the Amazirghs, who rendered himself renowned through the empire
by fighting a pitch-battle with the Imperial troops in 1819.Such chiefs
and tribes occasion the weakness of the interior; for, whenever the
Sultan has been embroiled with European Powers, these aboriginal
Amazirghs invariably seized the opportunity of avenging their wrongs and
ancient grudges.The Shereefs always compound with them, if they can,
these primitive tribes being so many centres of an _imperium imperio_,
or of revolt and disaffection.Tijijet in the province of Dukkalah, situate on the left bank of the
river Omm-Erbegh, along the route from Fez to Morocco, is a small town,
but was formerly of considerable importance.A famous market for grain is held here, which is attended by the tribe
of the Atlas: the country abounds in grain and cattle of the finest
breed.Bulawan or Bou-el-Awan, "father of commodious ways or journeys," is a
small town of 300 houses, with an old castle, formerly a place of
consequence; and lying on an arm of the river Omm-Erbegh _en route_ from
Morocco to Salee and Mequinez and commanding the passage of the river.It is 80 miles from Morocco, and 110 from Salee.On the opposite side of
the river, is the village of Taboulaunt, peopled mostly with Jews and
ferrymen.Soubeit is a very ancient city on the left bank of the Omm-Erbegh,
surrounded with walls, and situate twenty miles from El-Medina in a
mountainous region abounding with hares; it is inhabited by a tribe of
the same name, or probably Sbeita, which is also the name of a tribe
south of Tangier.Meramer is a city built by the Goths on a fertile plain, near Mount
Beni-Megher, about fourteen miles east of Saffee, in the province of
Dukkala, and carrying on a great commerce in oil and grain.El-Medina is a large walled populous city of merchants and artizans, and
capital of the district of Haskowra; the men are seditious, turbulent
and inhospitable; the women are reputed to be fair and pretty, but
disposed, when opportunity offers, to confer their favours on strangers.There is another place four miles distant of nearly the same name.Tagodast is another equally large and rich city of the province of
Haskowra crowning the heights of a lofty mountain surrounded by four
other mountains, but near a plain of six miles in extent, covered with
rich vegetation producing an immense quantity of Argan oil, and the
finest fruits.This place contains about 7,000 inhabitants, who are a noble and
hospitable race.Besides, Argan oil, Tagodast is celebrated for its red
grapes, which are said to be as large as hen's eggs--the honey of
Tagodast is the finest in Africa.Dimenet or Demnet is a considerable town, almost entirely populated by
the Shelouhs and Caraaite Jews; it is situate upon the <DW72>s of a
mountain of the same name, or Adimmei, in the district of Damnat,
fifteen miles distant from Wad Tescout, which falls into the Tensift.The inhabitants are reputed to be of a bad and malignant character, but,
nevertheless, learned in Mussulman theology, and fond of disputing with
foreigners.Orthodoxy and morality are frequently enemies of one
another, whilst good-hearted and honest people are often hetherodox in
their opinions.Aghmat, formerly a great and flourishing city and capital of the
province of Rhamna, built by the Berbers, and well fortified--is now
fallen into decay, and consists only of a miserable village inhabited by
some sixty families, among which are a few Jews--Aghmat lies at the foot
of Mount Atlas, on the road which conducts to Tafilett, near a river of
the same name, and in the midst of a fine country abounding in orchards
and vine-yards; Aghmat was the first capital of the Marabout dynasty.Fronga is a town densely populated almost entirely by Shelouhs and Jews,
lying about fifteen miles from the Atlas range upon an immense plain
which produces the finest grain in Morocco.Tednest, the ancient capital of the province of Shedmah, and built by
the Berbers, is deliciously placed upon a paridisical plain, and was
once the residence of the Shereefs.It contains a population of four
thousand souls, one thousand eight hundred being Jews occupied with
commerce, whilst the rest cultivate the land.This is a division of
labour amongst Mahometans and Israelites not unfrequent in North Africa.But, as in Europe, the Jew is the trader, not the husbandman.Tekoulet is a small and pretty town, rising a short distance from the
sea, by the mouth of the stream Dwira, in the province of Hhaha.The
water is reckoned the best in the province, and the people are honest
and friendly; the Jews inhabit one hundred houses.Tesegdelt, is another city of the province of Hhaha, very large and
rich, perched high upon a mountain, and that fortified by nature.The
principal mosque is one of the finest in the empire.Tagawost is a city, perhaps the most ancient, and indeed the largest of
the province of Sous.It is distant ten miles from the great river Sous,
and fifty from the Atlas.The suburbs are surrounded with huge blocks of
stone.Togawost contains a number of shops and manufactories of good
workmen, who are divided into three distinct classes of people, all
engaged in continual hostilities with one another.The men are, however,
honest and laborious, while the women are pretty and coquettish.Augustine, whom the Mahometans have dubbed a Marabout, was
born in this city.Their trade is with the Sahara and Timbuctoo.Fedsi is another considerable city, anciently the capital of Sous,
reclining upon a large arm of the river Sous, amidst a fruitful soil,
and contains about fourteen thousand inhabitants, who are governed by
republican institutions.It is twenty miles E.N.E.Beneali is a town placed near to the source of the river Draha, in the
Atlas.It is the residence of the chief of the Berbers of Hadrar, on the
southern Atlas.Beni-Sabih, Moussabal, or Draha, is the capital of the province of
Draha, and a small place, but populated and commercial.On the river of
the same name, was the Draha of ancient geography.Tatta and Akka, are two towns or villages of the province of Draha,
situate on the southern confines of Morocco, and points of rendezvous
for the caravans in their route over the Great Desert.Tatta is four days direct east from Akka, and placed in 28 deg.Akka consists of two hundred houses,
inhabited by Mussulmen, and fifty by Jews.The environs are highly
cultivated.Akka is two days east of Wadnoun, situate on a plain at the
foot of Gibel-Tizintit, and is placed in 28 deg.Messa is, according to Graeberg, a walled city, built
by the Berbers, not far from the river Sous, and divided like nearly all
the cities of Sous, into three parts, or quarters, each inhabited by
respective classes of Shelouhs, Moors, and Jews.Cities are also divided
in this manner in the provinces of Guzzala and Draha.The sea on the
coast of Sous throws up a very fine quantity of amber.The town is named Assah, and
distant about two miles from the sea, there being a few scattered houses
on each side of the river, to within half a mile of the sea.The place
is of no importance, famed only for having near it a market on Tuesday,
to which many people resort.Assah is
also the name of the district though which the Sous river flows.The
Bas-el-wad (or head of the river) is very properly the name of the upper
part of the river; when passing through Taroudant it takes the name of
Sous.Fifteen miles from Assah is the town of Aghoulon, containing about
six hundred people.Talent, or Tilin, the difference only is the adding of the Berber
termination.The other consonants are the same, perhaps, as Mr.It is a strong city, and capital of the province
of Sous-el-Aksa, or the extreme part of Sous.This province is sometimes
called Tesset, or Tissert.A portion of it is also denominated
Blad-Sidi-Hasham, and forms a free and quasi-independant state, founded
in 1810 by the Emir Hasham, son of the Shereef Ahmed Ben Mousa.This
prince was the bug-bear of Captain Riley.The district contains upwards
of twenty-five thousand Shelouhs and industrious Arabs.Talent is the
residence of the prince, and is situate on the declivity of a hill, not
far from the river Wad-el-Mesah, or Messa, and a mile from Ilekh, or
Ilirgh, a populous village, where there is a famous sanctuary, resorted
to by the Mahometans of the surrounding regions, of the name of Sidi
Hamed-ou-Mousa, (probably Ben Mousa).The singularity of this sacred
village is, that Jews constitute the majority of the population.But
they seem absolutely necessary to the very existence of the Mussulmen of
North Africa, who cannot live without them, or make profitable exchange
of the products of the soil, or of native industry, for European
articles of use and luxury.Shtouka, or Stuka, is, according to some, a large town or village; or,
as stated by Davidson, a _district_.The fact is, many African districts
are called by the name of a principal town or village in them, and _vice
versa_.This place stands on the banks of the Wad-el-Mesah, and is
inhabited by some fifteen hundred Shelouhs, who are governed by a
Sheikh, nearly independent of Morocco.On Talent and Shtouka, Mr."There is no town called
Stuka; it is a district; none that I can find called Talent; there is
Tilin.The Mesah flows through Stuka, in which district are twenty
settlements, or rather towns, some of which are large.They are known in
general by the names of the Sheikhs who inhabit them.I stopped at
Sheikh Hamed's.Tilin was distant from this spot a day's journey in the
mountains towards the source of the river.If by Talent, Tissert is
meant, Oferen (a town) is distant six miles."On the province of Sous generally, Don J.A.Conde has this note:--

"In this region (Sous) near the sea, is the temple erected in honour of
the prophet Jonas; it was there he was cast out of the belly of the
whale."This temple, says Assed Ifriki, is made of the bones of whales
which perish on this coast.A little further on, he alludes to the
breaking of horses, and being skilful in bodily exercises, for the Moors
and Numidians have always been renowned in that respect.In the lesser and more remote towns, I have followed generally the
enumeration of Count Graeberg, but there are many other places on the
maps, with varieties of names or differences of position.Our geography
of the interior of Morocco, especially in the South, is still very
obscure, and I have only selected those towns and places of whose
present existence there is no question.My object, in the above
enumeration, has been simply to give the reader a proximate estimate of
the population and resources of this country.Of the strength and number
of the tribes of the interior, we know scarcely anything.The names of
the towns and villages of the South, so frequently beginning and ending
with T., sufficiently indicate the preponderance of the Berber
population, under the names of Shelouh or Amazirgh, whilst the great
error of writers has been to represent the Arabs as more numerous than
this aboriginal population.Monsieur E. Renou, in his geographical description of the Empire of
Morocco (Vol.of the "Exploration Scientifique," &c.)foolishly
observes that there is no way of arriving at correct statistics of this
empire, except by comparing it with Algeria; and then remarks, which is
true enough, "Malheureusement, la population de l'Algerie n'est pas
encore bien connue."When, however, he asserts that the numbers of
population given by Jackson and Graeberg are gross, and almost
unpardonable exaggerations, given at hazard, I am obliged to agree with
him from the personal experience I had in Morocco, and these Barbary
countries generally.Jackson makes the whole of the population to amount to almost fifteen
millions, or nearly two thirds more than it probably amounts to.Graeberg
estimates it at eight millions and a half.But how, or why, or
wherefore, such estimates are made is not so easy to determine.Certain
it is, that the whole number of cities which I have enumerated, scarcely
represent one million of inhabitants.But for those who like to see
something more definite in statistics, however exaggerated may be the
estimate, I shall give the more moderate calculations of Graeberg, those
of Jackson being beyond all rhyme or reason.Graeberg thus classifies and
estimates the population.Amazirghs, Berbers, and Touaricks       2,300,000
  Amazirghs, Shelouhs and Arabs           1,450,000
  Arabs, mixed Moors, &c.3,550,000
  Arabs pure, Bedouins, &c.740,000
  Israelites, Rabbinists, and Caraites      339,500
  <DW64>s, Fullans, and Mandingoes          120,000
  Europeans and Christians                      300
  Renegades                                     200
                                         ----------
                Total                     8,500,000

If two millions are deducted from this amount, perhaps the reader will
have something like a probable estimate of the population of Morocco.It
is hardly correct to classify Moors as mixed Arabs, many of them being
simply descendants of the aboriginal Amazirghs.I am quite sure there
are no Touaricks in the Empire of Morocco.Of the Maroquine Sahara, I have only space to mention the interesting
cluster of oases of Figheegh, or Figuiq.Shaw mentions them as "a knot
of villagers," noted for their plantations of palm-trees, supplying the
western province of Algeria with dates.We have now more ample
information of Figheegh, finding this Saharan district to consist of an
agglomeration of twelve villages, the more considerable of which are
Maiz, counting eight hundred houses, El-Wadghir five hundred, and Zenega
twelve hundred.The others vary from one or two hundred houses.The
villages are more or less connected together, never farther apart than a
quarter of a league, and placed on the descent of Wal-el-Khalouf ("river
of the wild boar") whence water is procured for the gardens, containing
varieties of fruit-trees and abundance of date-palms, all hedged round
with prickly-pears.Madder-root and tobacco are also cultivated, besides
barley sufficient for consumption.The Wad-el-Khalouf is dry, except in winter, but its bed is bored with
inexhaustible wells, whose waters are distributed among the gardens by
means of a _clepsydra_, or a vessel which drops so much water in an
hour.The ancients measured time by the dropping of water, like the
falling of sand in the hour-glass.Some of the houses in these villages have two stories, and are well
built; each place has its mosque, its school, its kady, and its sheikh,
and the whole agglomeration of oases is governed by a Sheikh Kebir,
appointed by the Sultan of Morocco.These Saharan villages are eternally
in strife with one another, and sometimes take up arms.On this account,
they are surrounded by crenated walls, defended by towers solidly built.The immediate cause of discord here is water, that precious element of
all life in the desert.But the imaginations of the people are not
satisfied with this simple reason, and they are right, for the cause
lies deeply in the human heart.They say, however, their ancestors were
cursed by a Marabout, to punish them for their laxity in religion, and
this was his anathema, "God make you, until the day of judgment, like
wool-comber's cards, the one gnawing the other!"Their wars, in fact, are most cruel, for they destroy the noble and
fruitful palms, which, by a tacit convention, are spared in other parts
of the Sahara when these quarrels proceed to bloodshed.They have,
besides, great tact in mining, and their reputation as miners has been a
long time established.But, happily, they are addicted to commerce and
various branches of industry, as well as war, having commercial
relations with Fez, Tafilett and Touat, and the people are, therefore,
generally prosperous.London Jew-boys.--Excursion to the Emperor's garden, and the Argan
Forests.--Another interview with the Governor of Mogador on the
Anti-Slavery Address.--Opinion of the Moors on the Abolition of Slavery.We have at times imported into Mogador a stray London Jew or so, of the
lower lemon-selling sort.These lads from the Minories, are highly
exasperated against the Moors for treating them with so much contempt.Indeed, a high-spirited London Jew-boy will not stop at Mogador, though
the adult merchant will, to get money, for mankind often learn baseness
with age, and pass to it through a golden door.One of these Jew-boys,
being cursed by a man, naturally cursed him again, "an eye for an eye, a
tooth for a tooth."Willshire did not think so; and, on the
complaint of the Moor, the British Consul threw the British Jew-boy into
a Moorish prison, where he remained for some days.This is one more
instance of the disadvantage of having commercial consuls, where
everything is sacrificed to keep on good terms with government
authorities.A fire happened the other night, breaking out in the house of one of the
rich Jewish merchants; but it was soon extinguished, the houses being
built chiefly of mortar and stone, with very little wood.The Governor
got up, and went to the scene of "conflagration;" he cracked a few jokes
with the people and went home to bed.The Moors were sorry the fire did
not extend itself, wanting to have an opportunity of appropriating a few
of the merchant's goods.Elton, with other friends, to spend the day
in the pleasant valley of the Saneeates-Sultan, (Garden of the Emperor)
sometimes called Gharset-es-Sultan, three or four hours' ride south from
Mogador.The small river of Wad-el-Kesab, (overlooked by the village of
Deeabat, where watch-dogs were barking apparently all day long as well
as night), lay in our way, and was with difficulty forded, heavy rain
having fallen up the country, though none on the coast.These Barbary
streams are very deceptive, illustrating the metaphor of the book of
Job, "deceitful as a brook."To-day, their beds are perfectly dry;
to-morrow, a sheet of turbid water dashing and foaming to the ocean,
covers them and the country round, whilst the immediate cause is
concealed.Abrupt and sudden overflowings occur in all rivers having
their source in mountains.The book of Job may also refer to the
disappointment of Saharan travellers, who, on arriving weary and
thirsty, dying for water, at the stream of the Desert, find it dried up,
and so perish.The country in the valley of the Emperor's garden offers nothing
remarkable.Bushes of underwood covering sandy mounds, a few palmettos
and Argan trees, in which wild doves fluttered and flew about, were all
that broke the monotony of a perfect waste.There were no cultivated
lands hereabouts, and I was told that a great part of Morocco presents
this desolate aspect.We visited, however, the celebrated Argan tree,
which the people pretend was planted by the lieutenant of the Prophet,
the mighty Okba, who, having spurred his horse in the roaring rebellious
surge of the Atlantic, wept and wailed before Heaven that there were no
more nations in whose heart to plunge his awful scimitar--so teaching
them the mercy of God!the old hoary tree, with a most peaceful
patriarchal look, seemed to belie the honour, stretching out its broad
sinewy arm to shelter a hundred people from the darting fires of an
African sun.A more noble object of inanimate nature is not to be
contemplated than a large and lofty branching tree; in its boughs and
leaves, endlessly varying, matted together and intersecting each other,
we see the palpable image of infinity.But in the dry and hot climate of
Africa, this tree is a luxury which cannot be appreciated in Europe.We sat under its fresh shade awhile, gazing with security at the bright
fires of the sun, radiating over and through all visible nature.To
check our enthusiasm, we had strewn at our feet old broken bottles and
crockery, the _debris_ and classic relics of former visitors, who were
equally attentive to creature-comforts as to the grandeur of the Argan
monarch of the surrounding forest.The Emperor's garden contains a well of water and a few fruit-trees, on
the trunk of one of which, a fine fig-tree, were carved, in durable
bark, the names of European visitors.Among the rest, that of a famous
_belle_, whose gallant worshippers had cut her name over all its broad
trunk, though they may have failed to cut their own on the plastic and
india-rubber tablet of the fair one's heart.This carving on the
fig-tree is the sum of all that Europeans have done in Morocco during
several ages.We rather adopt Moorish habits, and descend to their
animal gratifications than inculcate our own, or the intellectual
pleasures of Christian nations.European females brought up in this
country, few excepted, adopt with gusto the lascivious dances of the
Mooresses; and if this may be said of them, what may we not think of the
male class, who frequently throw off all restraint in the indulgence of
their passions?While reposing under the umbrageous shade of the Argan tree, a Moor
related to us wondrous sprite and elfin tales of the forests of of these
wilds.At one period, the Argan woods were full of enchantresses, who
prevented good Mussulmen from saying their prayers, by dancing before
them in all their natural charms, to the sounds of melodious and
voluptuous music; and if a poor son of the Prophet, perchance, passed
this way at the stated times of prayer, he found it impossible to attend
to his devotions, being pestered to death by these naughty houries.On another occasion, when it was high summer and the sun burnt every
leaf of the black Argan foliage to a yellow red, and whilst the arid
earth opened her mouth in horrid gaps, crystal springs of water were
seen to bubble forth from the bowels of the earth, and run in rills
among _parterres_ of roses and jessamines.The boughs of the Argan tree
also suddenly changed into _jereeds_ of the date-palm burdened with
luscious fruit; but, on weary travellers descending to slake their
parching thirst and refresh themselves, they fell headlong into the
gaping holes of the ground, and disappeared in the abyss of the dark
entrails of the world.These Argan forests continued under the fearful ban of the enchantress
and wicked jinns, until a holy man was brought from the farthest desert
upon the back of a flying camel, who set free the spell-bound wood by
tying on each bewitched tree a small piece of cork bark on which was
inscribed the sacred name of the Deity.The legends of these haunted
Argan forests remind us of the enchanted wood of Tasso, whose
enchantment was dissolved by the gallant knight, Rinaldo, and which
enabled the Crusaders to procure wood for the machines of war to assault
and capture the Holy City.Two quotations will shew the universality and
permanence of superstition, begotten of human hopes and fears.Such is
the beautiful imagery devoted to superstitious musings, by the
illustrious bard:--

  "While, like the rest, the knight expects to hear
  Loud peals of thunder breaking on his ear,
  A dulcet symphony his sense invades,
  Of nymphs, or dryads, warbling through the shades.Soft sighs the breeze, soft purls the silver rill.The feathered choir the woods with music fill;
  The tuneful swan in dying notes complains;
  The mourning nightingale repeats her strains,
  Timbrels and harps and human voices join,
  And in one concert all the sounds combine!"Then for the streamlets and flowerets--

  "Where'er he treads, the earth her tribute pours,
  In gushing springs, or voluntary flowers.Here blooms the lily; there the fragrant rose;
  Here spouts a fountain; there a riv'let flows;
  From every spray the liquid manna trills,
  And honey from the softening bark distills.Again the strange the pleasing sound he hears,
  Of plaints and music mingling in his ears;
  Yet naught appears that mortal voice can frame.Nor harp, nor timbrel, whence the music came."I had another interview with the Governor on Anti-Slavery subjects.Treppass accompanied me, and assisted to interpret.His Excellency was
very condescending, and even joked about his own slaves, asking me how
much I would give him for them.He then continued:--"I am happy to see
you before your departure.Whilst you have been here, I have heard
nothing of your conduct but what was just and proper.You are a quiet
and prudent man, [28] and I am sorry I could not assist you in your
business (abolition).The Sultan will be glad that you and I have not
quarrelled, but are friends."I then asked His Excellency if a person
were to come direct from our Government, with larger powers and
presents, he would have a better chance of success.The Governor
replied, "Not the least whatever.You have done all that could have been
done.We look at the subject, not the persons.The Sultan will never
listen to anybody on this subject.You may cut off his head, but cannot
convince him.If all the Christians of the world were to come and take
this country, then, of course, the Mussulmen would yield the question to
superior force, to the decree of God, but not till then."Myself.--"How is it, Sidi, that the Bey of Tunis, and the Imaum of
Muscat have entered into engagements with Christians for the suppression
of slavery, they being Mussulmen?"The Governor.--"I'll tell you; we Mussulmen are as bad as you Christians.Some of our people go to one mosque,
and will not go to another.They are foolish (_mahboul_).So it is with
the subject of slaves.Some are with you, but most are with me.The Bey
of Tunis, and the Imaum have a different opinion from us.They think
they are right, and we think we are right; but we are as good as they."Myself.--"Sidi, does not the Koran encourage the abolition of slavery,
and command it as a duty to all pious Mussulmen?"The Governor.--"No, it does not command it, but those who voluntarily
liberate their slaves are therein commended, and have the blessing of
God on them."[29]

Myself.--"Sidi, is it in my power to do anything for you in London?"The Governor.--"Speak well of me, that is all.Tell your friends I did
all I could for you."I may mention the opinions of the more respectable Moors, as to the
mission.They said, "If you had managed your mission well, the Sultan
would have received your Address; your Consul is slack; the French
Consul is more active, because he is not the Sultan's merchant.Our
Sultan must receive every person, even a beggar, because God receives
all.You would not have obtained the liberation of our slaves, but the
Sultan would have promised you everything.All that emanates from the
English people is good this we are certain of; but it would have been
better had you come with letters from the Bey of Tunis, shewing what had
been done in that country."Treppass is also of the opinion, that a
deputation of several persons, accompanied with some presents for the
Emperor and his ministers, would have produced a better effect, by
making an appearance of shew and authority, suitable to the ideas of the
people.[30] If coming direct from Government, it would have greater
weight.He thinks, besides, there are a good number of Moors who are favourable
to abolition.Of the connexion between the east and Morocco, he says,
all the Barbary States look up to the Sultan of Constantinople as to a
great authority, and during the last few years, an active
correspondence, on religious matters, has been carried on between
Morocco and Constantinople, chiefly through a celebrated doctor of the
name of Yousef.If the Turkish Sultan, therefore, would _bona-fide_
abolish the slave-markets, I have no doubt this would produce an
impression in Morocco favourable to abolition.During the time I was in Morocco, I distributed some Arabic tracts,
translated from the English by Professor Lee of Cambridge, on the
abolition of slavery.A few Arabic Bibles and Hebrew New Testaments were
also placed at my disposal for circulation by the Societies.I also
wrote an Anti-slavery circular to the British merchants of Mogador, on
Lord Brougham's Act.El-Jereed, the Country of Dates.--Its hard soil.--Salt Lake.Its vast
extent.--Beautiful Palm-trees.--The Dates, a staple article of Food.--
Some Account of the Date-Palm.--Made of Culture.--Delicious Beverage.--
Tapping the Palm.--Meal formed from the Dates.--Baskets made of the
Branches of the Tree.--Poetry of the Palm.--Its Irrigation.--
Palm-Groves.--Collection of Tribute by the "Bey of the Camp."El-Jereed, or Belad-el-Jereed, the country of dates, or literally, the
country of the palm branches, is a part of the Sahara, or the hot dry
country lying in the immediate vicinity of the Great Desert.Its
principal features of soil and climate offer nothing different from
other portions of the Sahara, or the Saharan regions of Algeria and
Morocco.The Belad-el-Jereed, therefore, may be properly called the
Tunisian Sahara.Shaw observes generally of Jereed:--"This part of the
country, and indeed the whole tract of land which lies between the
Atlantic and Egypt, is by most of the modern geographers, called
Biledulgerid, a name which they seem to have borrowed from
Bloid-el-Jeridde, of the Arabians, who merely signify the dry country;
though, if we except the Jeridde, a small portion of it which is situate
on this side of Lesser Syrtis, and belongs to the Tunisians, all the
rest of it is known by no other general name than the Sahara or Sahra,
among those Arabs, at least, whom I have conversed with."Besides the grand natural feature of innumerable lofty and branching
palms, whose dark depending slender leaves, are depicted by the Arabian
poet as hanging gracefully like the dishevelled ringlets of a beautiful
woman in distress, there is the vast salt lake, El-Sibhah, or literally
the "salt plain," and called by some modern geographers the
Sibhah-el-Soudeeat, or Lake of Marks, from having certain marks made of
the trunks of the palm, to assist the caravans in their marches across
its monotonous samelike surface.This vast lake, or salt plain, was divided by the ancients into three
parts, and denominated respectively, Palus Tritonis, Palus Pallas, and
Palus Libya.The first is derived from the river Triton, which according
to Ptolemy and other ancient geographers, is made to pass through this
lake in its course to the sea, but which is the present river Ghobs,
where it falls into the Mediterranean.The name Pallas is derived from
the tradition of Pallas having accompanied Sesostris in his Asiatic
expeditions with the Lybian women, and she may have been a native of the
Jereed.The lake measures from north-east to south-west about seventy
English miles, with a third of the breadth, but it is not one collection
of water; there being several dry places, like so many islands,
interspersed over its surface, depending however, as to their number and
extent upon the season of the year, and upon the quantity of water in
the particular season."At first, on crossing it," says a tourist, "the grass and bushes become
gradually scarcer; then follows a tract of sand, which some way beyond,
becomes in parts covered with a thin layer of salt.This, as you
advance, is thicker and more united; then we find it a compact and
unbroken mass or sheet, which can, however, be penetrated by a sword, or
other sharp instrument, and here it was found to be eleven inches in
depth; and finally in the centre, it became so hard, deep, and
concentrated, as to baffle all attempts at breaking its surface except
with a pickaxe.The horse's shoe, in fact, makes no impression upon its
stone-like surface."The salt of the lake is considerably weaker than that of the sea, and
not adapted for preserving provisions, though its flavour is very
agreeable; it is not exported, nor made in any way an article of
commerce.The Jereed, from the existence in it of a few antiquities, such as
pieces of granite and marble, and occasionally a name or a classic
inscription, is proved to have been in the possession of the Romans, and
undoubtedly of the Carthaginians before them, who could have had no
difficulty in holding this flat and exposed country.The trade and resources of this country consist principally in dates.The quantity exported to other parts of the Regency, as well as to
foreign countries, where their fine quality is well known, is in round
numbers on an average from three to four thousand quintals per annum.But in Jereed itself, twenty thousand people live six months of the year
entirely on dates."A great number of poles," says Sir Grenville Temple, "are arranged
across the rooms at the height of eight or nine feet from the ground,
and from these are suspended rich and large bunches of dates, which
compose the winter store of the inhabitants; and in one corner of the
room is one or more large earthern jars about six or seven feet high,
also filled with dates pressed close together, and at the bottom of the
jar is a cock, from which is drawn the juice in the form of a thick
luscious syrup.It is scarcely possible to imagine anything more
palatable than this'sweet of sweets.'"As we are writing of the country of dates, _par excellence_, I must
needs give some description of the palm, but it will be understood that
the information is Tunisian, or collected in Tunis, and may differ in
some respects from details collected in other parts of North Africa.The
date-palm abounds in the maritime as well as in the inland districts of
North Africa.They are usually propagated from shoots of full grown
trees, which if transplanted and taken care of, will yield in six or
seven years, whilst those raised immediately from the stone require
sixteen years to produce fruit.The date-palm is male and female, or _dioecious_, and requires
communication, otherwise the fruit is dry and insipid.The age of the
palm, in its greatest vigour, is about thirty years, according to the
Tunisians, after planting, and will continue in vigour for seventy
years, bearing anually fifteen or twenty clusters of dates, each of them
fifteen or twenty pounds in weight; after this long period, they begin
gradually to wither away.But the Saharan Tripolitans will tell you that
the date-palm does not attain its age of full vigour till it reaches a
hundred years, and then will flourish two or or three centuries before
it withers!The only culture requisite, is to be well watered at the roots once in
four or five days, and to have the lower boughs cut off when they begin
to droop and wither.Much rain, however, injures the dates, and we know
that the countries in which they flourish, are mostly without rain.In
many localities in Africa, date-palms can never be watered in the dry
season; it is nevertheless observable that generally wherever a palm
grows and thrives water may usually be obtained by boring.The sap, or
honey of the palm is a delicious and wholesome beverage when drunk quite
fresh; but if allowed to remain for some hours, it acquires a sharp
taste, something like cider, and becomes very intoxicating.It is called
poetically _leghma_, "tears" of the dates.When a tree is found not to
produce much fruit, the head is cut off, and a bowl or cavity scooped
out of the summit, in which the rising sap is collected, and this is
drunk in its pure state without any other preparation.If the tree be
not exhausted by draining, in five or six months it grows afresh; and,
at the end of two or three years, may again be cut or tapped.The palm
is capable of undergoing this operation five or six times, and it may be
easily known how often a tree has been cut by the number of rings of a
narrow diameter which are seen towards its summit; but, if the sap is
allowed to flow too long, it will perish entirely at the end of a year.This sap, by distillation, produces an agreeable spirit called _Araky_
or _Arak_: from the fruit also the Jews distil a spirit called _bokka_,
or what we should call _toddy_.It is usual for persons of distinction
to entertain their friends upon a marriage, or the birth of a child,
with this pure sap, and a tree is usually tapped for the purpose.It
would appear that tapping the palm was known to the ancients, for a
cornelian _intaglio_ of Roman antiquity, has been found in the Jereed,
representing a tree in this state, and the jars in which the juice was
placed.Dates are likewise dried in the sun, and reduced into a kind of meal,
which will keep for any length of time, and which thus becomes a most
valuable resource for travellers crossing the deserts, who frequently
make it their only food, moistening a handful of it with a little water.Certain preparations are made of the male plant, to which medicinal
virtues are attributed; the younger leaves, eaten with salt, vinegar,
and oil, make an excellent salad.The heart of the tree, which lies at
top between the fruit branches, and weighs from ten to twenty pounds, is
eaten only on grand occasions, as those already mentioned, and possesses
a delicious flavour between that of a banana and a pine-apple.The palm, besides these valuable uses to which it is applied,
superseding or supplying the place of all other vegetables to the tribes
of the Jereed, is, nevertheless, still useful for a great variety of
other purposes.The most beautiful baskets, and a hundred other
nick-nackery of the wickery sort are made of its branches; ropes are
made and vestments wove from the long fibres, and its wood, also, when
hardened by age, is used for building.Indeed, we may say, it is the all
and everything of the Jereed, and, as it is said of the camel and the
desert, _the palm is made for the Jereed, and the Jereed is made for the
palm_.The Mussulmen make out a complete case of piety and superstition in the
palm, and pretend that _they are made for the palm, and the palm is made
for them_, alleging that, as soon as the Turks conquered Constantinople,
the palm raised its graceful flowing head over the domes of the former
infidel city, whilst when the Moors evacuated Spain, the palm pined
away, and died."God," adds the pious Mussulman, "has given us the palm;
amongst the Christians, it will not grow!"But the poetry of the palm is
an inseparable appendage in the North African landscape, and even town
scenery.The Moor and the Arab, whose minds are naturally imbued with
the great images of nature, so glowingly represented also in the sacred
leaves of the Koran, cannot imagine a mosque or the dome-roof of a
hermitage, without the dark leaf of the palm overshadowing it; but the
serenest, loveliest object on the face of the landscape is _the lonely
palm_, either thrown by chance on the brow of some savage hill or
planted by design to adorn some sacred spot of mother-earth.I must still give some other information which I have omitted respecting
this extraordinary tree.And, after this, I further refer the reader to
a Tour in the Jereed of which some details are given in succeeding
pages.A palm-grove is really a beautiful object, and requires scarcely
less attention than a vineyard.The trees are generally planted in a
_quincunx_, or at times without any regular order; but at distances from
each other of four or five yards.The situation selected is mostly on
the banks of some stream or rivulet, running from the neighbouring
hills, and the more abundant the supply of water, the healthier the
plants and the finer the fruit.For this tree, which loves a warm
climate, and a sandy soil, is yet wonderfully improved by frequent
irrigation, and, singularly, the _quality_ of the water appears of
little consequence, being salt or sweet, or impregnated with nitre, as
in the Jereed.Irrigation is performed in the spring, and through the whole summer.The
water is drawn by small channels from the stream to each individual
tree, around the stalk and root of which a little basin is made and
fenced round with clay, so that the water, when received, is detained
there until it soaks into the earth.(All irrigation is, indeed,
effected in this way.)As to the abundance of the plantations, the fruit
of one plantation alone producing fifteen hundred camels' loads of
dates, or four thousand five hundred quintals, three quintals to the
load, is not unfrequently sold for one thousand dollars.Besides the
Jereed, Tafilett, in Morocco, is a great date-country.Jackson says,
"We found the country covered with most magnificent plantations, and
extensive forests of the lofty date, exhibiting the most elegant and
picturesque appearance that nature on a plain surface can present to the
admiring eye.In these forests, there is no underwood, so that a
horseman may gallop through them without impediment."Our readers will see, when they come to the Tour, that this description
of the palm-groves agrees entirely with that of Mr.I have already mentioned that the palm is male and female, or,
as botanists say, _dioecious_; the Moors, however, pretend that the palm
in this respect is just like the human being.The _female_ palm alone
produces fruit and is cultivated, but the presence or vicinity of the
_male_ is required, and in many oriental countries there is a law that
those who own a palm-wood must have a certain number of _male_ plants in
proportion.In Barbary they seem to trust to chance, relying on the male
plants which grow wild in the Desert.They hang and shake them over the
female plants, usually in February or March.Koempfe says, that the male
flowers, if plucked when ripe, and cautiously dried, will even, in this
state, perform their office, though kept to the following year.The Jereed is a very important portion of the Tunisian territory,
Government deriving a large revenue from its inhabitants.It is visited
every year by the "Bey of the Camp," who administers affairs in this
country as a sovereign; and who, indeed, is heir-apparent to the
Tunisian throne.Immediately on the decease of the reigning Bey, the
"Bey of the Camp" occupies the hereditary beylick, and nominates his
successor to the camp and the throne, usually the eldest of the other
members of the royal family, the beylick not being transmitted from
father to son, only on the principle of age.At least, this has been the
general rule of succession for many years.The duties of the "Bey of the Camp" is to visit with a "flying-camp,"
for the purpose of collecting tribute, the two circuits or divisions of
the Regency.I now introduce to the reader the narrative of a Tour to the Jereed,
extracted from the notebooks of the tourists, together with various
observations of my own interspersed, and some additional account of
Toser, Nefta, and Ghafsa.Tour in the Jereed of Captain Balfour and Mr.Reade.--Sidi Mohammed.--
Plain of Manouba.--Tunis.--Tfeefleeah.--The Bastinado.--Turkish
Infantry.--Kairwan.--Sidi Amour Abeda.--Saints.--A French Spy--
Administration of Justice.--The Bey's presents.--The Hobara.--Ghafsa.Hot streams containing Fish.--Snakes.--Incantation.--Moorish Village.The tourists were Captain Balfour, of the 88th Regiment, and Mr.Richard
Reade, eldest son of Sir Thomas Reade.The morning before starting from Tunis they went to the Bardo to pay
their respects to Sidi Mohammed, "Bey of the Camp," and to thank him for
his condescending kindness in taking them with him to the Jereed.The
Bey told him to send their baggage to Giovanni, "Guarda-pipa," which
they did in the evening.At nine A. M. Sidi Mohammed left the Bardo under a salute from the guns,
one of the wads of which nearly hit Captain Balfour on the head.The Bey
proceeded across the plain of Manouba, mounted on a beautiful bay
charger, in front of the colours, towards Beereen, the greater part of
the troops of the expedition following, whilst the entire plain was
covered with baggage-camels, horses, mules, and detached parties of
attendants, in glorious confusion.The force of the camp consisted of--Mamelukes
  of the Seraglio, superbly mounted               20

  Mamelukes of the Skeefah, or those who
  guard the entrance of the Bey's
  palace, or tent, and are all Levantines         20

  Boabs, another sort of guard of the Bey,
  who are always about the Bey's
  tent, and must be of this country               20

  Turkish Infantry                               300
  Spahis, o. mounted Arab guards                 300
  Camp followers (Arabs)                       2,000
                                               -----
             Total                             2,660

This is certainly not a large force, but in several places of the march
they were joined for a short time by additional Arab troops, a sort of
honorary welcome for the Bey.As they proceeded, the force of the
camp-followers increased; but, in returning, it gradually decreased, the
parties going home to their respective tribes.We may notice the total
absence of any of the new corps, the Nithalm.This may have been to
avoid exciting the prejudices of the people; however, the smallness of
the force shows that the districts of the Jereed are well-affected.The
summer camp to Beja has a somewhat larger force, the Arabs of that and
other neighbouring districts not being so loyal to the Government.Besides the above-named troops, there were two pieces of artillery.The
band attendant on these troops consisted of two or three flageolets,
kettle-drums, and trumpets made of cow-horns, which, according to the
report of our tourists, when in full play produced the most diabolical
discord.After a ride of about three hours, we pitched our tents at Beereen.Through the whole of the route we marched on an average of about four
miles per hour, the horses, camels, &c., walking at a good pace.The
Turkish infantry always came up about two hours after the mounted
troops.Immediately on the tents being pitched, we went to pay our
respects to the Bey, accompanied by Giovanni, "Guardapipa," as
interpreter.His Highness received us very affably, and bade us ask for
anything we wanted.Afterwards, we took some luncheon with the Bey's
doctor, Signore Nunez Vaise, a Tuscan Jew, of whose kindness during our
whole tour it is impossible to speak too highly.The doctor had with him
an assistant, and tent to himself.Haj Kador, Sidi Shakeer, and several
other Moors, were of our luncheon-party, which was a very merry one.About half-way to Beereen, the Bey stopped at a marabet, a small square
white house, with a dome roof, to pay his devotions to a great Marabout,
or saint, and to ask his parting blessing on the expedition.They told
us to go on, and joined us soon after.Two hours after us, the Turkish
Agha arrived, accompanied with colours, music, and some thirty men.The
Bey received the venerable old gentleman under an immense tent in the
shape of an umbrella, surrounded with his mamelukes and officers of
state.After their meeting and saluting, three guns were fired.The Agha
was saluted every day in the same manner, as he came up with his
infantry after us.We retired for the night at about eight o'clock.The form of the whole camp, when pitched, consisting of about a dozen
very large tents, was as follows:--The Bey's tent in the centre, which
was surrounded at a distance of about forty feet with those of the
Bash-Hamba [31] of the Arabs, the Agha of the Arabs, the Sahab-el-Tabah,
Haznadar or treasurer, the Bash-Boab, and that of the English tourists;
then further off were the tents of the Katibs and Bash-Katib, the
Bash-Hamba of the Turks, the doctors, and the domestics of the Bey, with
the cookery establishment.Among the attendants of the Bey were the
"guarda-pipa," guard of the pipe, "guarda-fusile," guard of the gun,
"guarda-cafe," guard of the coffee, "guarda-scarpe," guard of the shoes,
[32] and "guarda-acqua," guard of water.A man followed the Bey about
holding in his hand a golden cup, and leading a mule, having two paniers
on its back full of water, which was brought from Tunis by camels.There
was also a story-teller, who entertained the Bey every night with the
most extraordinary stories, some of them frightfully absurd.The Bey did
not smoke--a thing extraordinary, as nearly all men smoke in Tunis.None of his ladies ever accompany him in
these expeditions.The tents had in them from twenty to fifty men each.Our tent consisted
of our two selves, a Boab to guard the baggage, two Arabs to tend the
horses and camels, and another Moor of all work, besides Captain
Balfour's Maltese, called Michael.The first night we found very cold; but having abundance of clothing, we
slept soundly, in spite of the perpetual wild shoutings of the Arab
sentries, stationed round the camp, the roaring and grumbling of the
camels, the neighing and coughing of the horses, all doing their utmost
to drive away slumber from our eyelids.We halted on the morrow, which gave us an opportunity of getting a few
things from Tunis which we had neglected to bring.But before returning,
we ate some sweetmeats sent us by the guarda-pipa, with a cup of coffee.The guarda-pipa is also a dragoman interpreter of his Highness, and a
Genoese by birth, but now a renegade.In this country they do not know
what a good breakfast is; they take a cup of coffee in the morning
early, and wait till twelve or one o'clock, when they take a hearty
meal, and then sup in the evening, late or early, according to the
season.Before returning to Tunis, we called upon his Highness, and told
him our object.We afterwards called to see the Bey every morning, to
pay our respects to him, as was befitting on these occasions.His
Highness entered into the most familiar conversation with us.On coming back again from Tunis, it rained hard, which continued all
night.In the evening the welcome news was proclaimed that the tents
would not be struck until daylight: previously, the camp was always
struck at 3 o'clock, about three hours before daylight, which gave rise
to great confusion, besides being without shelter during the coldest
part of the night (three hours before sun-rise) was a very serious trial
for the health of the men.The reason, however, was, to enable the
camels to get up to the new encampment; their progress, though regular
and continual, is very slow.Of a morning the music played off the _reveil_ an hour before sunrise.The camp presented an animated appearance, with the striking of tents,
packing camels, mounting horses, &c. We paid our respects to his
Highness, who was sitting in an Arab tent, his own being down.The music
was incessantly grating upon our ears, but was in harmony with the
irregular marching and movements of the Arabs, one of them occasionally
rushing out of the line of march, charging, wheeling about, firing,
reloading, shouting furiously, and making the air ring with his cries.The order of march was as follows:--The Bey mounts, and, going along
about one hundred yards from the spot, he salutes the Arab guards, who
follow behind him; then, about five or six miles further, overtaking the
Turkish soldiers, who, on his coming up, are drawn up on each side of
the road, his Highness salutes them; and then afterwards the
water-carriers are saluted, being most important personages in the dry
countries of this circuit, and last of all, the gunners; after all
which, the Bey sends forward a mameluke, who returns with the Commander,
or Agha of the Arabs, to his Highness.This done, the Bey gallops off to
the right or left from the line of march, on whichsoever side is most
game--the Bey going every day to shoot, whilst the Agha takes his place
and marches to the next halting-place.One morning the Bey shot two partridges while on horseback.Rade, "he is the best shot on horseback I ever saw--he seldom
missed his game."As Captain B. was riding along with the doctor, they
remarked a cannon-ball among some ruins; but, being told a saint was
buried there, they got out of the way as quick as if a deadly serpent
had been discovered.Stretching away to the left, we saw a portion of
the remains of the Carthaginian aqueduct.The march was only from six to
eight miles, and the encampment at Tfeefleeah.At day-break, at noon, at
3 o'clock, P.M.and at sunset, the Muezzen called from outside and near
the door of the Bey's tent the hour of prayer.An aide-de-camp also
proclaimed, at the same place, whether we should halt, or march, on the
morrow, The Arabs consider fat dogs a great delicacy, and kill and eat
them whenever they can lay hands upon them.Captain B. was fortunate in
not bringing his fat pointer, otherwise he would have lost him.The
Arabs eat also foxes and wolves, and many animals of the chase not
partaken of by us.The French in Algiers kill all the fat cats, and turn
them into hares by dexterous cooking.The mornings and evenings we found
cold, but mid-day very hot and sultry.We left Tfeefleeah early, and went in search of wild-boar; found only
their tracks, but saw plenty of partridges and hares; the ground being
covered with brushwood and heath, we soonae lost sight of them.The Arabs
were seen on a sudden running and galloping in all directions, shouting
and pointing to a hill, when a huge beast was put up, bristling and
bellowing, which turned out to be a hyaena.He was shot by a mameluke, Si
Smyle, and fell in a thicket, wallowing in his blood.He was a fine
fellow, and had an immense bead, like a bull-dog.They put him on a
mule, and carried him in triumph to the Bey.When R. arrived at the
camp, the Bey sent him the skin and the head as a present, begging that
he would not eat the brain.There is a superstitious belief among the
Moors that, if a person eats the brain of a hyaena he immediately becomes
mad.The hyaena is not the savage beast commonly represented; he rarely
attacks any person, and becomes untameably ferocious by being only
chained up.He is principally remarkable for his stupidity when at large
in the woods.The animal abounds in the forests of the Morocco Atlas.Our tourists saw no lions _en route_, or in the Jereed; the lion does
not like the sandy and open country of the plain.Very thick brushwood,
and ground broken with rocks, like the ravines of the Atlas, are his
haunts.Several Arabs were flogged for having stolen the barley of which they
had charge.The bastinado was inflicted by two inferior mamelukes,
standing one on each side of the culprit, who had his hands and his feet
tied behind him.In general, it may be said that bastinadoing in Tunis
is a matter of form, many of the strokes ordered to be inflicted being
never performed, and those given being so many taps or scratches.It is
very rare to see a man bleeding from the bastinado; I (the author) never
did.It is merely threatened as a terror; whilst it is not to be
overlooked, that the soles of the feet of Arabs, and the lower classes
in this country, are like iron, from the constant habit of going
barefoot upon the sharpest stones.Severe punishments of any kind are
rarely inflicted in Tunis.The country was nearly all flat desert, with scarcely an inhabitant to
dissipate its savage appearance.The women of a few Arab horsehair tents
(waterproof when in good repair) saluted us as we passed with their
shrill looloos.We passed the
ruins of several towns and other remains.The camels were always driven
into camp at sunset, and hobbled along, their two fore-legs being tied,
or one of them being tied up to the knee, by which the poor animals are
made to cut a more melancholy figure than with their usual awkward gait
and moody character.We continued our march about ten miles in nearly a southern direction,
and encamped at a place called Heelet-el-Gazlen.One morning shortly after starting, we came to a small stream with very
high and precipitous banks, over which one arch of a fine bridge
remained, but the other being wanting, we had to make a considerable
_detour_ before we could cross; the carriages had still greater
difficulty.Here we have an almost inexcusable instance of the
disinclination of the Moors to repairs, for had the stream been swollen,
the camp would have been obliged to make a round-about march by the way
of Hamman-el-Enf, of some thirty miles; and all for the want of an arch
which would scarcely cost a thousand piastres!This stream or river is
the same as that which passes near Hamman-el-Enf, and the extensive
plain through which it meanders is well cultivated, with douwars, or
circular villages of the Arabs dotted about.We saw hares, but, the
ground being difficult running for the dogs, we caught but few.Bevies
of partridges got up, but we were unprepared for them.In the evening,
the Bey sent a present of a very fine bay horse to R. Marched about ten
miles, and halted at Ben Sayden.The following day after starting, we left the line of march to shoot;
saw one boar, plenty of foxes and wolves, and we put up another hyaena,
but the bag consisted principally of partridges, the red-legged
partridge or _perdix ruffa_, killed, by the Bey, who is a dead-shot.Our
ride lay among hills; there was very little water, which accounted for
the few inhabitants.After dinner, went out shooting near Jebanah, and
bagged a few partridges, but, not returning before the sun went down,
the Bey sent a dozen fellows bawling out our names, fearing some harm
had befallen us.On leaving the hills, there lay stretched at our feet a boundless plain,
on which is situate Kairwan, extending also to Susa, and leagues around.North Africa, is a country of hills and plains--such was the case along
our entire route.We saw a large herd of gazelles feeding, as well as
several single ones, but they have the speed of the greyhound, so we did
not grace our supper with any.Saw several birds called Kader, about the
size of a partridge, but we shot none.A good many hares and partridges
either crossed our path or whirred over our heads.Passed over a running
stream called Zebharah, where we saw the remains of an ancient bridge,
but in the place where the baggage went over there was a fine one in
good repair.Here was a small dome-topped chapel, called Sidi Farhat, in
which are laid the ashes of a saint.We had seen many such in the hills;
indeed these gubbah abound all over Barbary, and are placed more
frequently on elevations.We noticed particularly the 300 Turkish
infantry; they were irregulars with a vengeance, though regulars
compared to the Arabs.On overtaking them, they drew up on each side,
and some dozen of them kept up a running sham fight with their swords
and small wooden and metal shields before the Bey.The officers kissed
the hand of the Bey, and his treasurer tipped their band, for so we must
call their tumtums and squeaking-pipes.This ceremony took place every
morning, and they were received in the camp with all the honours.They
kept guard during the night, and did all they could to keep us awake by
their eternal cry of "Alleya," which means, "Be off," or "Keep your
distance!"These troops had not been recruited for eight years, and will
soon die off; and yet we see that the Bey treats these remnants of the
once formidable Turkish Tunisian Janissaries with great respect; of
course, in an affair with the Arabs, their fidelity to the Bey would be
most unshaken.As we journeyed onward, we saw much less vegetation and very little
cultivation.An immense plain lay before and around us, in which,
however, there was some undulating ground.Passed a good stone bridge;
were supplied with water near a large Arab encampment, around which were
many droves of camels; turned up several hares, partridges, and
gazelles.One of the last gave us a good chase, but the greyhounds
caught him; in the first half mile, he certainly beat them by a good
half of the instance, but having taken a turn which enabled the dogs to
make a short cut, and being blown, they pulled the swift delicate
creature savagely down.There were several good courses after hares,
though her pursuers gave puss no fair play, firing at her before the
dogs and heading her in every possible way.Prince Pueckler
Muskau was the fourth when he visited it in 1835.The town is clean, but
many houses are in ruins.The greater part of a regiment of the Nitham
are quartered here.The famous mosque, of course, we were not allowed to
enter, but many of its marble pillars and other ornaments, we heard from
Giovanni, were the spoils of Christian churches and Pagan temples.The
house of the Kaed was a good specimen of dwellings in this country.Going along a street, we were greatly surprised at seeing our
attendants, among whom were Si Smyle (a very intelligent and learned
man, and who taught Mr.R. Arabic during the tour) and the Bash-Boab,
jumping off their horses, and, running up to an old-looking Moor, and
then seizing his hand, kissed it; and for some time they would not leave
the ragged ruffian-like saint.At last, having joined us, they said he was Sidi Amour Abeda, a man of
exceeding sanctity, and that if the Bey had met the saint, his Highness
must have done the same.The saint accompanied us to the Kaed's house;
and, on entering, we saw the old Kaed himself, who was ill and weeping
on account of the arrival of his son, the commander of a portion of the
guards of the camp.We went up stairs, and sat down to some sweetmeats
which had been prepared for us, together with Si Smyle and Hamda, but,
as we were commencing, the saint, who was present, laid hold of the
sweets with his hands, and blessed them, mumbling _bismillas_ [33] and
other jargon.We afterwards saw a little house, in course of erection by
order of the Bey, where the remains of Sidi Amour Abeda are to be
deposited at his death, so that the old gentleman can have the pleasure
of visiting his future burial-place.In this city, a lineal descendant
of the Prophet, and a lucky guesser in the way of divining, are the
essential ingredients in the composition of a Moorish saint.Saints of
one order or another are as thick here as ordinary priests in Malta,
whom the late facetious Major Wright was accustomed to call
_crows_--from their black dress--but better, cormorants, as agreeing
with their habits of fleecing the poor people.Sidi Amour Abeda's hands
ought to be lily-white, for every one who meets him kisses them with
devout and slavering obeisance.The renegade doctor of the Bey told us
that the old dervish now in question would like nothing better than to
see us English infidels burnt alive.Fanaticism seems to be the native
growth of the human heart!We afterwards visited the Jabeah, or well, which they show as a
curiosity, as also the camel which turns round the buckets and brings up
the water, being all sanctified, like the wells of Mecca, and the
drinking of the waters forming an indispensable part of the pilgrimage
to all holy Mohammedan cities.We returned to the Kaed's, and sat down to a capital dinner.The old
Governor was a great fanatic, and when R. ran up to shake hands with
him, the mamelukes stopped R. for fear he might be insulted.We visited
the fortress, which was in course of repair, our _cicerone_ being Sidi
Reschid, an artillery-officer.We then returned to the camp, and found
Santa Maria, the French officer, had arrived, who, during the tour,
employed himself in taking sketches and making scientific observations.He was evidently a French spy on the resources of the Bey.It was given
out, however, that he was employed to draw charts of Algiers, Tunis, and
Tripoli, by his Government.He endeavoured to make himself as unpopular
as some persons try to make themselves agreeable, being very jealous of
us, and every little thing that we had he used to cry for it and beg it
like a child, sometimes actually going to the Bey's tent in person, and
asking his Highness for the things which he saw had been given to us.We went to see his Highness administer justice, which he always did,
morning and evening, whilst at Kairwan.There were many plaintiffs, but
no defendants brought up; most of them were turned out in a very summary
manner.To some, orders were given, which we supposed enabled them to
obtain redress; others were referred to the kadys and chiefs.The Bey,
being in want of camels, parties were sent out in search of them, who
drove in all the finest that they could find, which were then marked
("taba,") _a la Bey_, and immediately became the Bey's property.It was
a curious sight to see the poor animals thrown over, and the red-hot
iron put to their legs, amidst the cries and curses of their late
different owners--all which were not in the least attended to, the wants
of the Bey, or Government, being superior on such occasions of
necessity, or what not, to all complaint, law, or justice.About two
hundred changed hands in this way.The Bey of Tunis has an immense number of camels which he farms out.He
has overseers in certain districts, to whom he gives so many camels;
these let them out to other persons for mills and agricultural labours,
at so much per head.The overseers annually render an account of them to
Government, and, when called upon, supply the number required.At this
time, owing to a disorder which had caused a great mortality, camels had
been very scarce, and this was the reason of the extensive seizure just
mentioned.If an Arab commits manslaughter, his tribe is mulcted
thirty-three camels; and, as the crime is rather common in the Bedouin
districts, the Bey's acquisition in this way is considerable.A few
years ago, a Sicilian nobleman exported from Tunis to Sicily some eighty
camels, the duty for which the Bey remitted.The camel, if ever so
healthy and thriving in the islands of the Mediterranean, could never
supersede the labour of mules.The camel is only useful where there are
vast plains to travel, as in North Africa, Arabia, Persia, Australasia,
and some parts of the East Indies.A hundred more Arabs joined, who passed in a single file before the Bey
for inspection: they came rushing into the camp by twos and threes,
firing off their long guns.We crossed large plains, over which ran troops of gazelles, and had many
gallops after them; but they go much faster than the greyhound, and,
unless headed and bullied, there is little chance of taking them, except
found asleep.On coming on a troop unawares, R. shot one, which the dogs
caught.R. went up afterwards to cut its throat _a la Moresque_, when he
was insulted by an Arab.R. noticed the fellow, and afterwards told the
Bey, who instantly ordered him to receive two hundred bastinadoes, and
to be put in chains; but, just as they had begun to whip him, R. went up
and generously begged him off.This is the end of most bastinados in the
country.We passed a stream which they said had swallowed up some
persons, and was very dangerous.A muddy stream, they add, is often very
fatal to travellers.The Bey surprised Captain B. by sending him a
handsome black horse as a present; he also sent a grey one to the
Frenchman, who, when complaining of it, saying that it was a bad one, to
the Bey's mamelukes, his Highness sent for it, and gave him another.Under such circumstances, Saint Mary ought to have looked very foolish.The Bey shot a kader, a handsome bird, rather larger than a partridge,
with black wings, and flies like a plover.We had a large
hawking-establishment with us, some twenty birds, very fine falconry,
which sometimes carried off hares, and even attacked young goat-kids.Marched to a place called Gilma, near which the road passes through an
ancient town.Shaw says, "Gilma, the ancient Cilma, or Oppidum
Chilmanenense, is six leagues to the east-south-east of Spaitla.We have
here the remains of a large city, with the area of a temple, and some
other fragments of large buildings.According to the tradition of the
Arabs, this place received its name in consequence of a miracle
pretended to have been wrought by one of their marabouts, in bringing
hither the river of Spaitla, after it was lost underground.For Ja Elma
signifies, in their language, 'The water comes!'an expression we are to
imagine of surprise at the arrival of the stream."During our tour, the mornings were generally cold.We proceeded about
twenty miles, and encamped near a place called Wady Tuckah.This river
comes from the hills about three or four miles off, and when the camp
arrives at Kairwan, the Bey sends an order to the Arabs of the district
to let the water run down to the place where the tents are pitched.When
we arrived, the water had just come.We saw warrens of hares, and caught
many with the dogs.Troops of gazelles were also surprised; one was
fired at, and went off scampering on three legs.The hawks caught a
beautiful bird called hobara, or habary, [34] about the size of the
small hen-turkey, lily white on the back, light brown brindle, tuft of
long white feathers on its head, and ruffle of long black feathers,
which they stretch out at pleasure, with a large grey eye.A curious
prickly plant grows about here, something like a dwarf broom, if its
leaves were sharp thorns, it is called Kardert.The Bey made R. a
present of the hobara.One day three gazelles were caught, and also a fox, by R.'s greyhound,
which behaved extremely well, and left the other dogs in the rear, every
now and then attacking him in the hind-quarters.Saw seven or eight
hobaras, but too windy for the hawks to be flown.Captain B. chased a
gazelle himself, and had the good fortune to catch him.As soon as an
Arab secures an animal, he immediately cuts its throat, repeating
"Bismillah, Allah Akbar," "In the name (of God), God is great."We marched seventeen miles to a place called Aly Ben Own, the name of
the saint buried close by.The plain we crossed must have been once
thickly inhabited, as there were many remains.We were joined by more
Arabs, and our force continued to augment.The Bey, being in want of
horses, the same system of seizing them was adopted as with the camels.One splendid morning that broke over our encampment we had an
opportunity of witnessing Africa's most gorgeous scenery.[35] Plenty of
hobaras; they fly like a goose.The hawks took two or three of them,
also some hares.The poor hare does not know what to make of the hawks;
after a little running, it gives itself up for death, only first dodging
out of the bird's pounce, or hiding itself in a tuft of grass or a bush,
but which it is not long allowed to do, for the Arabs soon drive it out
from its vain retreat.The hawk, when he seizes the hare with one claw,
catches hold of any tuft of grass or irregularity of the ground with the
other; a strong leather strap is also fastened from one leg to the
other, to prevent them from being pulled open or strained.We came upon
a herd of small deer, called ebba, which are a little larger than the
gazelle, but they soon bounded beyond our pursuit, leaving us scarcely
time to admire their delicate make and unapproachable speed.We crossed a range of hills into another plain, at the extremity of
which lies Ghafsa.The surface was naked, with the exception of tufts of
strong, rushy grass, almost a sure indication of hares, and of which we
started a great number.We saw another description of bird, called
rhaad, [36] with white wings, which flew like a pigeon, but more
swiftly.Near our tract were the remains of a large tank of ancient
Roman construction.Marched fourteen or fifteen
miles to Zwaneah, which means "little garden," though there is no sign
of such thing, unless it be the few oranges, dates, and pomegranates
which they find here.We had water from a tank of modern construction;
some remains were close to the camp, the ancient cistern and stone duct
leading from the hills.We had two thousand camels with the camp and
following it, for which not a single atom of provender is carried, the
camels subsisting scantily upon the coarse grass, weeds or thorns, which
the soil barely affords.The camel is very fond of sharp, prickly
thorns.You look upon the animal, with its apparently most tender mouth,
chopping the sharpest thorns it can find, full of amazement!Some of the
chiefs who have lately joined us, have brought their wives with them,
riding on camels in a sort of palanquin or shut-up machine.These
palanquins have a kind of mast and shrouds, from which a bell is slung,
tinkling with the swinging motion of the camel.This rude contrivance
makes the camel more than ever "the ship of the Desert."Several fine
horses were brought in as presents to the Bey, one a very fine mare.Our next march was towards Ghafsa, about twenty miles off.We were
joined by a considerable number of fresh Arabs, who "played at powder,"
and kept firing and galloping before the Bey the whole day; some of them
managed themselves and their arms and horses with great address,
balancing the firelock on their heads, firing it, twisting it round,
throwing it into the air, and catching it again, and all without once
losing the command of their horses.An accident happened amidst the fun;
two of the parties came in contact, and one of them received a dreadful
gash on the forehead.The dresses of some of them were very rich, and
looked very graceful on horseback.A ride over sand-hills brought us in
view of the town, embedded in olive and date-trees, looking fresh and
green after our hot and dusty march; it lay stretched at the foot of a
range of hills, which formed the boundaries of another extensive plain.We halted at Ghafsa, [37] which is almost a mass of rubbish filled with
dirty people, although there are plenty of springs about, principally
hot and mineral waters.Although the Moors, by their religion, are
enjoined the constant use of the bath, yet because they do not change
their linen and other clothes, they are always very dirty.They do not,
however, exceed the Maltese and Sicilians, and many other people of the
neighbourhood, in filth, and perhaps the Moors are cleaner in their
hahits than they.The Arabs are extremely disgusting, and their women
are often seen in a cold winter's evening, standing with their legs
extended over a smoky wood fire, holding up their petticoats, and
continuing in this indelicate position for hours together.In these Thermae, or hot, sulphurous, and other mineral springs, is the
phenomenon of the existence of fish and small snakes.These were
observed by our tourists, but I shall give three other authorities
besides them.Shaw says: "'The Ouri-el-Nout,' _i.e_., 'Well of Fish,'
and the springs of Ghasa and Toser, nourish a number of small fishes of
the mullet and perch kind, and are of an easy digestion.Of the like
quality are the other waters of the Jereed, all of them, after they
become cold, being the common drink of the inhabitants."Sir Grenville
Temple remarks: "The thermometer in the water marked ninety-five
degrees; and, what is curious, a considerable number of fish is found in
this stream, which measure from four to six inches in length, and
resemble, in some degree, the gudgeon, having a delicate flavour.Bruce
mentions a similar fact, but he says he saw it in the springs of
Feriana.Part of the ancient structure of these baths still exists, and
pieces of inscriptions are observed in different places."Honneger has made a sketch of this fish.The wood-cut represents it
one half the natural size:

[Illustration]

The snake, not noticed by former tourists, has been observed by Mr.Honneger, which nourishes itself entirely upon the fish.The wood-cut
represents the snake half its natural size:

[Illustration]

The fish and the snake live together, though not very amicably, in the
hot-springs.Prince Puekler Muskau, who travelled in Tunis, narrates
that, "Near the ruins of Utica was a warm spring, in whose almost hot
waters we found several turtles, _which seemed to inhabit this basin_."However, perhaps, there is no such extraordinary difficulty in the
apprehension of this phenomenon, for "The Gulf Stream," on leaving the
Gulf of Mexico, "has a temperature of more than 27 deg.(centigrade), or
80-6/10 degrees of Fahrenheit."[38]

Many a fish must pass through and live in this stream.And after all,
since water is the element of fish, and is hotter or colder in all
regions, like the air, the element of man, which he breathes, warmer or
cooler, according to clime and local circumstances--there appear to be
no physical objections in the way of giving implicit credence to our
tourists.Water is so abundant, that the adjoining plain might be easily
irrigated, and planted with ten thousand palms and forests of olives.God is bountiful in the Desert, but man wilfully neglects these aqueous
riches springing up eternally to repair the ravages of the burning
simoum!In one of the groves we met a dervish, who immediately set about
charming our Boab.He began by an incantation, then seized him round the
middle, and, stooping a little, lifted him on his shoulders, continuing
the while the incantation.He then put him on his feet again, and, after
several attempts, appeared to succeed in bringing off his stomach
something in the shape of leaden bullets, which he then, with an air of
holy swagger, presented to the astonished guard of the Bey.The dervish
next spat on his patient's hands, closed them in his own, then smoothed
him down the back like a mountebank smooths his pony, and stroked also
his head and beard; and, after further gentle and comely ceremonies of
this sort, the charming of the charmer finished, and the Boab presented
the holy man with his fee.We dined at the Kaed's house; this
functionary was a very venerable man, a perfect picture of a patriarch
of the olden Scriptural times of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.There was
not a single article of furniture in the room, except a humble sofa,
upon which he sat.We inspected the old Kasbah at Ghafsa, which is in nearly a state of
ruin, and looked as if it would soon be down about our ears.It is an
irregular square, and built chiefly of the remains of ancient edifices.It was guarded by fifty Turks, whose broken-down appearance was in
perfect harmony with the citadel they inhabited.The square in a
building is the favourite form of the Moors and Mohammedans generally;
the Kaaba of Mecca, the _sanctum sanctorum_, is a square.The Moors
endeavour to imitate the sacred objects of their religion in every way,
even in the commonest affairs of human existence, whilst likewise their
troops of wives and concubines are only an earthly foretaste and an
earnest of the celestial ladies they expect to meet hereafter.We saw them making oil, which was in a very primitive fashion.The
oil-makers were nearly all women.The olives were first ground between
stones worked by the hands, until they became of the consistence of
paste, which was then taken down to the stream and put into a wooden tub
with water.On being stirred up, the oil rises to the top, which they
skim off with their hands and put into skins or jars; when thus skimmed,
they pass the grounds or refuse through a sieve, the water running off;
the stones and pulp are then saved for firing.But in this way much of
the oil is lost, as may be seen by the greasy surface of the water below
where this rude process is going on.Among the oil-women, we noticed a
girl who would have been very pretty and fascinating had she washed
herself instead of the olives.We entered an Arab house inhabited by
some twenty persons, chiefly women, who forthwith unceremoniously took
off our caps, examined very minutely all our clothes with an excited
curiosity, laughed heartily when we put our hands in our pockets, and
wished to do the same, and then pulled our hair, looking under our faces
with amorous glances.On the hill overlooking the town, we also met two
women screaming frightfully and tearing their faces; we learned that one
of them had lost her child.The women make the best blankets here with
handlooms, and do the principal heavy work.We saw some hobaras, also a bird called getah, smaller than a partridge,
something like a ptarmigan, with its summer feathers, and head shaped
like a quail.The Bey sent two live ones to R., besides a couple of
large jerboahs of this part, called here, _gundy_.They are much like
the guinea-pig, but of a sandy colour, and very soft and fine, like a
young hare.The jerboahs in the neighbourhood of Tunis are certainly
more like the rat.The other day, near the south-west gates, we fell in
with a whole colony of them--which, however, were the lesser animal, or
Jerd species--who occupied an entire eminence to themselves, the
sovereignty of which seemed to have been conceded to them by the Bey of
Tunis.They looked upon us as intruders, and came very near to us, as if
asking us why we had the audacity to disturb the tranquillity of their
republic.The ground here in many places was covered with a substance
like the rime of a frosty morning; it tastes like salt, and from it they
get nitre.The water which we drank was
brought from Ghafsa: the Bey drinks water brought from Tunis.We marched
across a vast plain, covered with the salt just mentioned, which was
congealed in shining heaps around bushes or tufts of grass, and among
which also scampered a few hares.We encamped at a place called
Ghorbatah.Close to the camp was a small shallow stream, on each side of
which grew many canes; we bathed in the stream, and felt much refreshed.The evening was pleasantly cool, like a summer evening in England, and
reminded us of the dear land of our birth.Numerous plains in North
Africa are covered with saline and nitrous efflorescence; to the
presence of these minerals is owing the inexhaustible fertility of the
soil, which hardly ever receives any manure, only a little stubble being
occasionally burnt.We saw flights of the getah, and of another bird called the gedur,
nearly the same, but rather lighter in colour.When they rise from the
ground, they make a curious noise, something like a partridge.We were
unusually surprised by a flight of locusts, not unlike grasshoppers, of
about two inches long, and of a reddish colour.Halted by the dry bed of a river, called Furfouwy.A pool supplied the
camp: in the mountains, at a distance, there was, however, a delicious
spring, a stream of liquid pearls in these thirsty lands!A bird called
mokha appeared now and then; it is about the size of a nightingale, and
of a white light-brown colour.We seldom heard such sweet notes as this
bird possesses.Its flying is beautifully novel and curious; it runs on
the ground, and now and then stops and rises about fifteen feet from the
surface, giving, as it ascends, two or three short slow whistles, when
it opens its graceful tail and darts down to the ground, uttering
another series of melodious whistles, but much quicker than when it
rises.We continued our march over nearly the same sort of country, but all was
now flat as far as the eye could see, the hills being left behind us.About eight miles from Furfouwy, we came to a large patch of date-trees,
watered by many springs, but all of them hot.Under the grateful shade
of the lofty palm were flowers and fruits in commingled sweetness and
beauty.Here was the village of Dra-el-Hammah, surrounded, like all the
towns of the Jereed, with date-groves and gardens.The houses were most
humbly built of mud and bricks.After a scorching march, we encamped
just beyond, having made only ten miles.Saw quantities of bright soft
spar, called talc.Here also the ground was covered with a saline
effloresence.Near us were put up about a dozen blue cranes, the only
birds seen to-day.A gazelle was caught, and others chased.We
particularly observed huge patches of ground covered with salt, which,
at a distance, appeared just like water.Toser.--The Bey's Palace.--Blue Doves.--The town described.--Industry

arrived at the top of a rising ground, at the base of which was situate
the famous Toser, the head-quarters of the camp in the Jereed, and as
far as it goes.Behind the city was a forest of date-trees, and beyond
these and all around, as far as the eye could wander, was an
immeasurable waste--an ocean of sand--a great part of which we could
have sworn was water, unless told to the contrary.We were met, before
entering Toser, with some five or six hundred Arabs, who galloped before
the Bey, and fired as usual.The people stared at us Christians with
open mouths; our dress apparently astonished them.At Toser, the Bey
left his tent and entered his palace, so called in courtesy to his
Highness, but a large barn of a house, without any pretensions.We had
also a room allotted to us in this palace, which was the best to be
found in the town, though a small dark affair.Toser is a miserable
assemblage of mud and brick huts, of very small dimensions, the beams
and the doors being all of date-wood.The gardens, however, under the
date-trees are beautiful, and abundantly watered with copious streams,
all of which are warm, and in one of which we bathed ourselves and felt
new vigour run through our veins.We took a walk in the gardens, and
were surprised at the quantities of doves fluttering among the
date-trees; they were the common blue or Barbary doves.In the environs
of Mogador, these doves are the principal birds shot.Toser, or Touzer, the _Tisurus_ of ancient geography, is a considerable
town of about six thousand souls, with several villages in its
neighbourhood.The impression of Toser made upon our tourists agrees with that of the
traveller, Desfontaines, who writes of it in 1784:--"The Bey pitched his
tent on the right side of the city, if such can be called a mass of
_mud-houses_."Shaw,
who says that "the villages of the Jereed are built of mud-walls and
rafters of palm-trees."Evidently, however, some improvement has been
made of late years.The Arabs of Toser, on the contrary, and which very
natural, protested to the French scientific commission that Toser was
the finest city in El-Jereed.They pretend that it has an area as large
as Algiers, surrounded with a mud wall, twelve or fifteen feet high, and
crenated.In the centre is a vast open space, which serves for a
market-place.Toser has mosques, schools, Moorish baths--a luxury rare
on the confines of the Desert, fondouks or inns, &c. The houses have
flat terraces, and are generally well-constructed, the greater part
built from the ruins of a Roman town; but many are now dilapidated from
the common superstitious cause of not repairing or rebuilding old
houses.The choice material for building is brick, mostly unbaked or
sun-dried.Toser, situate in a plain, is commanded from the north-west by a little
rocky mountain, whence an abundant spring takes its source, called
_Meshra_, running along the walls of the city southward, divides itself
afterwards in three branches, waters the gardens, and, after having
irrigated the plantations of several other villages, loses itself in the
sand at a short distance.The wells within the city of Toser are
insufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants, who fetch water
from Wad Meshra.The neighbouring villages are Belad-el-Ader, Zin,
Abbus; and the sacred villages are Zaouweeat, of Tounseea, Sidi Ali Bou
Lifu, and Taliraouee.The Arabs of the open country, and who deposit
their grain in and trade with these villages, are Oulad Sidi Sheikh,
Oulad Sidi Abeed, and Hammania.The dates of Toser are esteemed of the
finest quality.Walked about the town; several of the inhabitants are very wealthy.The
dead saints are, however, here, and perhaps everywhere else in Tunis,
more decently lodged, and their marabets are real "whitewashed
sepulchres."They make many burnouses at Toser, and every house presents
the industrious sight of the needle or shuttle quickly moving.We tasted
the leghma, or "tears of the date," for the first time, and rather liked
it.On going to shoot doves, we, to our astonishment, put up a snipe.The weather was very hot; went to shoot doves in the cool of the
evening.The Bey administers justice, morning and evening, whilst in the
Jereed.An Arab made a present of a fine young ostrich to the Bey, which
his Highness, after his arrival in Tunis, sent to R. The great man here
is the Sheikh Tahid, who was imprisoned for not having the tribute ready
for the Bey.The tax imposed is equivalent to two bunches for each
date-tree.The Sheikh has to collect them, paying a certain yearly sum
when the Bey arrives, a species of farming-out.It was said that he is
very rich, and could well find the money.The dates are almost the only
food here, and the streets are literally gravelled with their stones.Santa Maria again returned his horse to the Bey, and got another in its
stead.He is certainly a man of _delicate_ feeling.This gentleman
carried his impudence so far that he even threatened some of the Bey's
officers with the supreme wrath of the French Government, unless they
attended better to his orders.A new Sheikh was installed, a good thing
for the Bey's officers, as many of them got presents on the occasion.We blessed our stars that a roof was over our heads to shield us from
the burning sun.We blew an ostrich-egg, had the contents cooked, and
found it very good eating.They are sold for fourpence each, and it is
pretended that one makes an ample meal for twelve persons.We are
supplied with leghma every morning; it tastes not unlike cocoa-nut milk,
but with more body and flavour.R. very unwell, attributed it to his
taking copious draughts of the leghma.Rode out of an evening; there was
a large encampment of Arabs outside the town, thoroughly sun-burnt,
hardy-looking fellows, some of them as black as <DW64>s.Many people in
Toser have sore eyes, and several with the loss of one eye, or nearly
so; opthalmia, indeed, is the most prevalent disease in all Barbary.The
neighbourhood of the Desert, where the greater part of the year the air
is filled with hot particles of sand, is very unfavourable to the sight;
the dazzling whiteness of the whitewashed houses also greatly injures
the eyes.But the Moors pretend that lime-washing is necessary to the
preservation of the houses from the weather, as well as from filth of
all sorts.We think really it is useful, by preventing dirty people in
many cases from being eaten up by their own filth and vermin,
particularly the Jews, the Tunisian Jews being the dirtiest persons in
the Regency.The lime-wash is the grand _sanitary_ instrument in North
Africa.There are little birds that frequent the houses, that might be called
Jereed sparrows, and which the Arabs name boo-habeeba, or "friend of my
father;" but their dress and language are very different, having reddish
breasts, being of a small size, and singing prettily.Shaw mentions them
under the name of the Capsa-sparrow, but he is quite wrong in making
them as large as the common house-sparrow.He adds: "It is all over of a
lark-colour, excepting the breast, which is somewhat lighter, and
shineth like that of a pigeon.The boo-habeeba has a note infinitely
preferable to that of the canary, or nightingale."He says that all
attempts to preserve them alive out of the districts of the Jereed have
failed.R. has brought several home from that country, which were alive
whilst I was in Tunis.There are also many at the Bardo in cages, that
live in this way as long as other birds.Went to see the houses of the inhabitants: they were nearly all the
same, the furniture consisting of a burnouse-loom, a couple of
millstones, and a quantity of basins, plates, and dishes, hung upon the
walls for effect, seldom being used; there were also some skins of
grain.The beams across the rooms, which are very high, are hung with
onions, dates, and pomegranates; the houses are nearly all of one story.Some of the women are pretty, with large long black eyes and lashes;
they colour the lower lid black, which does not add to their beauty,
though it shows the bewitching orb more fully and boldly.They were
exceedingly dirty and ragged, wearing, nevertheless, a profusion of
ear-rings, armlets, anclets, bracelets, and all sorts of _lets_, with a
thousand talismanic charms hanging from their necks upon their ample
bosoms, which latter, from the habit of not wearing stays, reach as low
down as their waists.They wrap up the children in swaddling-clothes,
and carry them behind their backs when they go out.Two men were bastinadoed for stealing a horse, and not telling where
they put him; every morning they were to be flogged until they divulged
their hiding-place.A man brought in about a foot of horse's skin, on which was the Bey's
mark, for which he received another horse.This is always done when any
animal dies belonging to the Beys, the man in whose hands the animal is,
receiving a new one on producing the part of the skin marked.The Bey
and his ministers and mamelukes amused themselves with shooting at a
mark.The Bey and his mamelukes also took diversion in spoiling the appearance
of a very nice young horse; they daubed hieroglyphics upon his shoulders
and loins, and dyed the back where the saddle is placed, and the three
legs below the knee with henna, making the other leg look as white as
possible.Another grey horse, a very fine one, was also cribbed.We may
remark here, that there were very few fine horses to be met with, all
the animals looking poor and miserable, whilst these few fine ones fell
into the hands of the Bey.It is probable, however, that the Arabs kept
their best and most beautiful horses out of the way, while the camp was
moving among them.The bastinadoes with which he
had been treated were inflicted on his bare person, cold water being
applied thereto, which made the punishment more severe.After receiving
one hundred, he said he would shew his hiding-place; and some people
being sent with him, dug a hole where he pointed out, but without coming
to anything.This was done several times, but with the same effect.He
was then locked up in chains till the following morning.Millions of
dollars lie buried by the Arabs at this moment in different parts of
Barbary, especially in Morocco, perhaps the half of which will never be
found, the owners of them having died before they could point out their
hoarded treasures to their relatives, as but a single person is usually
in the secret.Money is in this way buried by tribes, who have nothing
whatever to fear from their sovereigns and their sheikhs; they do it
from immemorial custom.It is for this reason the Arabs consider that
under all ancient ruins heaps of money are buried, placed there by men
or demons, who hold the shining hoards under their invincible spell.They cannot comprehend how European tourists can undertake such long
journeys, merely for the purpose of examining old heaps of stones, and
making plans and pictures of such rubbish.When any person attempts to
convince the Arabs that this is the sole object, they only laugh with
incredulity.Went to Nefta, a ride of about fourteen miles, lying somewhat nearer the
Sahara than Toser.The country on the right was undulating sand, on the
left an apparently boundless ocean, where lies, as a vast sheet of
liquid fire, when the sun shines on it, the now long celebrated Palus
Libya.In this so-called lake no water is visible, except a small marsh
like the one near Toser, where we went duck-shooting.Our party was very
respectable, consisting of the Agha of the Arabs, two or three of the
Bey's mamelukes, the Kaed of the Jereed, whose name is Braun, and fifty
or sixty Arab guards, besides ourselves.On entering Nefta, the escort
immediately entered, according to custom, a marabet (that of Sidi Bou
Aly), Captain B. and R. meanwhile standing outside.There were two famous saints here, one of whom was a hundred years of
age.The other, Sidi Mustapha Azouz, had the character of being a very
clever and good man, which also his intelligent and benevolent
appearance betokened, and not a fanatic, like Amour Abeda of Kairwan.There were at the time of our visit to him about two hundred people in
his courtyard, who all subsisted on his charities.We were offered
dates, kouskousou, [39] and a seed which they call sgougou, and which
has the appearance of dried apple-seed.The Arabs eat it with honey,
first dipping their fingers into the honey, and then into the seed,
which deliciously sticks to the honey.The Sheikh's saint also
distributed beads and rosaries.He gave R. a bag of sgougou-seed, as
well as some beads.These two Sheikhs are objects of most religious
veneration amongst all true believers, and there is nothing which would
not be done at their bidding.Nefta, the Negeta of the ancients, is the frontier town of the Tunisian
territories from the south, being five days' journey, or about
thirty-five or forty leagues from the oases of Souf, and fifteen days'
from Ghadumes.Nefta is not so much a town as an agglomeration of
villages, separated from one another by gardens, and occupying an extent
of surface twice the size that of the city of Algiers.These villages
are Hal Guema, Mesaba, Zebda Ouled, Sherif, Beni Zeid, Beni Ali, Sherfa,
and Zaouweeah Sidi Ahmed.The position of Nefta and its environs is very picturesque.The principal source, which, under the name of Wad Nefta,
takes its rise at the north of the city, in the midst of a movement of
earth, enters the villages of Sherfa and Sidi Ahmed; divides them in
two, and fecundates its gardens planted with orange-trees, pomegranates,
and fig-trees.The same spring, by the means of ducts of earth, waters a
forest of date-trees which extends some leagues.A regulator of the
water (kaed-el-ma) distributes it to each proprietor of the plantation.The houses of Nefta are built generally of brick; some with taste and
luxury; the interior is ornamented with Dutch tiles brought from Tunis.Each quarter has its mosque and school, and in the centre of the group
of villages is a place called Rebot, on the banks of Wad Nefta, which
serves for a common market.Here are quarters specially devoted to the
aristocratic landed proprietors, and others to the busy merchants.The
Shereefs are the genuine nobles, or seigneurs of Nefta, from among whom
the Bey is wont to choose the Governors of the city.The complexion of
the population is dark, from its alliance with Negress slaves, like most
towns advanced in the Desert.They
are strict observers of the law, and very hospitable to strangers.Captain B., however, thought that, had he not been under the protection
of the Bey, his head would not have been worth much in these districts.Every traveller almost forms a different opinion, and frequently the
very opposite estimate, respecting the strangers amongst whom he is
sojourning.A few Jewish artizans have always been tolerated here, on
condition of wearing a black handkerchief round their heads, and not
mount a horse, &c. Recently the Bey, however, by solemn decrees, has
placed the Jews exactly on the same footing of rights and privileges as
the rest of his subjects.Nefta is the intermediate _entrepot_ of commerce which Tunis pours
towards the Sahara, and for this reason is called by the Arabs, "the
gate of Tunis;" but the restrictive system established by the Turks
during late years at Ghadumes, has greatly damaged the trade between the
Jereed and the Desert.The movement of the markets and caravans takes
place at the beginning of spring, and at the end of summer.Only a
portion of the inhabitants is devoted to commerce, the rich landed
proprietory and the Shereefs representing the aristocracy, lead the
tranquil life of nobles, the most void of care, and, perhaps, the
happiest of which contemplative philosophy ever dreamed.The oasis of
Nefta, indeed, is said to be the most poetic of the Desert; its gardens
are delicious; its oranges and lemons sweet; its dates the finest fruit
in the "land of dates."Nearly all the women are pretty, of that beauty
peculiar to the Oriental race; and the ladies who do not expose
themselves to the fierce sun of the day, are as fair as Mooresses.Santa Maria left for Ghabs, to which place there is not a correct route
laid down in any chart.There are three routes, but the wells of one are
only known to travellers, a knowledge which cannot be dispensed with in
these dry regions.The wells of the other two routes are known to the
bordering tribes alone, who, when they have taken a supply of water,
cover them up with sand, previously laying a camel-skin over the
well-mouth, to prevent the sand falling into the water, so that, while
dying with thirst, you might be standing on a well and be none the
wiser.The Frenchman has taken with him an escort of twelve men.The
weather is cooler, with a great deal of wind, raising and darkening the
sky with sand; even among the dategroves our eyes and noses were like so
many sand-quarries.Sheikh Tahib has been twice subjected to corporal punishment in the same
way as before mentioned, with the addition of fifty, but they cannot
make him bleed as they wish.He declares he has not got the money, and
that he cannot pay them, though they cut him to pieces.As he has
collected a great portion of the tribute of the people, one cannot much
pity the lying rogue.We were amused with the snake-charmers.These gentry are a company under
the protection of their great saint Sidi Aysa, who has long gone
upwards, but also is now profitably employed in helping the juggling of
these snake-mountebanks.These fellows take their snakes about in small
bags or boxes, which are perfectly harmless, their teeth and poison-bags
being extracted.They carry them in their bosoms, put them in their
mouths, stuffing a long one in of some feet in length, twist them around
their arms, use them as a whip to frighten the people, in the meanwhile
screaming out and crying unto their Heavenly protector for help, the
bystanders devoutly joining in their prayers.The snake-charmers usually
perform other tricks, such as swallowing nails and sticking an iron bar
in their eyes; and they wear their hair long like women, which gives
them a very wild maniacal look.Three of the mamelukes and ourselves went to Wedyen, a town and
date-wood about eight miles from Toser, to the left.The date-grove is
extensive, and there are seven villages in it of the same name.We slept
in the house of the Sheikh, who complained that the Frenchman, in
passing that way, had allowed his escort to plunder, and actually bound
the poor Sheikh, threatening him on his remonstrating.What conduct for
Christians to teach these people!One morning before daylight, we were on horseback, and _en route_
towards the hills, for the purpose of shooting loted, as they call a
species of deer found here.The ground in the neighbourhood of Wedyen is
tossed about like a hay-field, and volcanic looking.About four miles
off we struck into the rocks, on each side of our path, rising
perpendicularly in fantastic shapes.On reaching the highest ground, the
view was exceedingly wild.Much of the rock appeared as if it had only
just been cooled from a state of fusion; there was also a quantity of
tuffo rock, similar to that in the neighbourhood of Naples.The first
animal we saw was a wolf, which, standing on the sky-line of the
opposite hill, looked gigantic.The deep valley between, however,
prevented our nearer approach.We soon after came on a loted, who took to his heels, turning round a
mass of rock; but, soon after, he almost met as, and we had a view of
him within forty yards.Several shots were fired at him without effect,
and he at last made his escape, with a speed which defied all our
attempts at following him.Dismounting, the Sheikh Ali, of the Arab
tribe Hammama, who was with us, and who is the greatest deer-stalker in
the country, preceded us a little distance to look out for deer, the
marks of which were here very numerous.After a short time, an Arab
brought information of a herd of some thirty, with a good many young
ones; but our endeavours to have a shot at them were fruitless, though
one of the Arabs got near enough to loose the dogs at them, and a
greyhound was kicked over for his pains.We saw no more of them; but our
want of success was not surprising, silence not being in the least
attended to, and our party was far too large.The Arabs have such a
horrible habit of vociferation, that it is a wonder they ever take any
game at all.About the hills was scattered a great variety of aromatic
plants, quantities of shells, and whole oyster-beds, looking almost as
fresh as if they had been found by the sea-side.On our return from Toser, we had an extensive view of the Sahara, an
ocean as far as the eye could see, of what one would have taken his oath
was water, the shores, inlets, and bays being clearly defined, but, in
reality, nothing but salt scattered on the surface.Several islets were
apparently breaking its watery expanse, but these also were only heaps
of sand raised from the surrounding flat.The whole country, hills,
plains and deserts, gave us an idea as if the materials had been thrown
together for manufacture, and had never been completed.Nevertheless
these savage deserts of boundless extent are as complete in their kind
as the smiling meadows and fertile corn-fields of England, each being
perfect in itself, necessary to the grand whole of creation, and forming
an essential portion of the works of Divine Providence.The Sheikh Tahib's gardens were sold for 15,000 piastres, his wife also
added to this 1,000, and he was set at liberty.The dates have been
coming in to a great amount.The
principal are:--Degalah, the most esteemed, which are very sweet and
almost transparent.Captain B. preferred the Trungah, another first-rate
sort, which are plum-shaped, and taste something like a plum.There are
also the Monachah, which are larger than the other two, dryer and more
mealy, and not so sweet as Degalah, and other sorts.The dates were very
fine, though in no very great abundance, the superior state of ripeness
being attributed to there only being a single day of rain during the
past year in the Jereed.Rain is bad for the dates, but the roots of the
tree cannot have too much water.The tent-pitchers of the camp went round and performed, in mask, actions
of the most revolting description, some being dressed as women, and
dancing in the most lascivious and indecent manner.One fellow went up
to R., who was just on the point of knocking him down, when, seeing the
Treasurer of the Bey cracking his sides with laughter, he allowed the
brute to go off under such high patronage.It was even said that these
fellows were patronized by his Highness.But, on all Moorish feastdays,
lascivious actions of men and women are an indispensable part of their
entertainment.This is the worst side of the character of the Moors.The
Moorish women were never so profligate as since the arrival of the
French in Algeria.One of the greatest chiefs, Sultan Kaed, of the Hammama has just died.He was an extremely old man, and it is certain that people live to a
good old age in this burning clime.During his life, he had often
distinguished himself, and lastly against the French, before
Constantina.Whilst in the hills one day, we came suddenly upon a set of
Arabs, about nine in number, who took to their heels on seeing us.A man
has just been killed near this place, probably by the same gang.For
robbery and murder, no hills could be better fitted, the passes being so
intricate, and the winds and turns so sudden and sharp.The Sheikh Ali
brought in two loteds, a female and its young one, which he had shot.The head of the loted is like a deer's, but the eye is further up: it is
about a fallowdeer's size.The female has not the beard like a goat, but
long hair, reaching from the head to the bottom of the chest, and over
the fore-legs.These loteds were taken in consequence of an order from
the Bey, that they should not return without some.On our march back to Tunis, we encamped for two days by the foot of a
range of hills at Sheesheeah, about ten miles off.The water, brought
from some distance, was bad and salt.We proceeded to Ghortabah, our old place.Two of the prisoners (about
twelve of whom we had with us), and one of the Turks, died from the
excessive heat.The two couriers that were sent with despatches for the
Government were attacked near this place by the Arabs, and the horse of
one was so injured, that it was necessary to kill him; the man who rode
the horse was also shot through the leg.This was probably in revenge
for the exactions of the Bey of the Camp on the tribes.On our return to Ghafsa, we had rain, hail, and high wind, and
exceedingly cold--a Siberian winter's day on the verge of the scorching
desert.The ground, where there was clay, very slippery; the camels
reeled about as if intoxicated.The consequence was, it was long before
the tents came up, and we endured much from this sudden change of the
weather.Our sufferings were, however, nothing as compared to others,
for during the day, ten men were brought in dead, from the cold (three
died four days before from heat), principally Turks; and, had there been
no change in the temperature, we cannot tell how many would have shared
the same fate.Many of the camels, struggling against the clayey soil,
could not come up.Eight more men were shortly buried, and three were missing.The sudden
transition from the intense heat of the one day to the freezing cold of
the next, probably gave the latter a treble power, producing these
disastrous effects, the poor people being sadly ill-clad, and quite
unprepared for such extreme rigour.Besides, on our arrival at the camp,
all the money in Europe could not have purchased us the required
comforts, or rather necessaries, to preserve our health.We were exceedingly touched on hearing of the
death of a little girl, whom we saw driven out of a kitchen, in which
the poor helpless little thing had taken refuge from the inclemency of
the weather.Santa Maria arrived from Ghabs without accident, having scarcely seen a
soul the whole of the way.He certainly was an enterprizing fellow,
worthy of imitation.He calculated the distance from Ghabs to Toser at
200 miles.There are a number of towns in the districts of Ghabs better
built than those of Nefta and Toser; Ghabs river is also full of water
and the soil of the country is very fertile.The dates are not so good
as those of the Jereed.Ghabs is about 130 miles from Ghafsa.We here
took our farewell of Santa Maria; he went to Beja, the head-quarters of
the summer-camp: thence, of course, he would proceed to Algiers, to give
an account of his _espionage_.Next season, he said, he would go to
Tripoli and Ghadames; he had been many years in North Africa, and spoke
Arabic fluently.We next marched to Byrlafee, about twenty miles, and ninety-one from
Toser, where there are the ruins of an old town.The weather continued
cold and most wintry.Here is a very ancient well still in use.Fragments of cornices and pillars are strewn about.The foundations of
houses, and some massive stone towers, which from their having a pipe up
the centre, must have had something to do with regulating the water, are
all that remain.We had now much wind, but no rain.A great many camels and horses
perished.Altogether, the number of camels that died on the return of
the camp, was 550.The price of a camel varies from 60 to 200 piastres.Many good ones were sold at the camp for eighty piastres each, or about
two pounds ten shillings, English money.A good sheep was disposed of
for four or five piastres, or about three shillings.A horse in the extremities of nature, or near to
the _articulo mortis_, was sold for a piastre, eight pence; a camel, in
a like situation, was sold for a piastre and a half.A tolerably good
horse in Tunis sells at from 800 to 1000 piastres.There are the remains of an aqueduct at Gilma, and several other
buildings, the capitals of the pillars being elaborately worked.It is
seen that nearly the entire surface of Tunis is covered with remains of
aqueducts, Roman, Christian, and Moorish.If railways be applied to this
country--the French, are already talking about forming one from Algiers
to Blidah, across the Mitidjah--unquestionably along the lines will be
constructed ducts for water, which could thus be distributed over the
whole country.Instead of the camels of the "Bey of the Camp" carrying
water from Tunis to the Jereed, the railway would take from Zazwan, the
best and most delicious water in the Regency, to the dry deserts of the
Jereed, with the greatest facility.As to railways paying in this
country, the resources of Tunis, if developed, could pay anything.Marching onwards about eighteen miles, we encamped two or three beyond
an old place called Sidi-Ben-Habeeba.A man murdered a woman from
jealousy in the camp, but made his escape.Almost every eminence we
passed was occupied with the remains of some ancient fort, or temple.There was a good deal of corn in small detached patches, but it must be
remembered, the north-western provinces are the corn-districts.In the course of the following three days, we reached Sidi-Mahammedeah,
where are the magnificent remains of Udina.After about an hour's halt,
and when all the tents had been comfortably pitched, the Bey astonished
us with an order to continue our march, and we pursued our way to
Momakeeah, about thirty miles, which we did not reach until after dark.We passed, for some three or four hours, through a flight of locusts,
the air being darkened, and the ground loaded with them.At a little
distance, a flight of locusts has the appearance of a heavy snow-storm.These insects rarely visit the capital; but, since the appearance of
those near Momakeeah, they have been collected in the neighbourhood of
the city, cooked, and sold among the people.Momakeeah is a countryhouse
belonging to the Bey, to whom, also, belongs a great portion of the land
around.There is a large garden, laid out in the Italian style attached
to this country-seat.On arriving at Tunis, we called at the Bardo as we passed, and saw the
guard mounting.There was rather a fine band of military music; Moorish
musicians, but playing, after the European style, Italian and Moorish
airs.We must give here some account of our Boab's domestic concerns.He
boasted that he had had twenty-seven wives, his religion allowing four
at once, which he had bad several times; he was himself of somewhat
advanced years.According to him, if a man quarrels with his wife, he
can put her in prison, but must, at the same time, support her.A
certain quantity of provision is laid down by law, and he must give her
two suits, or changes, of clothes a year.But he must also visit her
once a week, and the day fixed is Friday.If the wife wishes to be
separated, and to return to her parents, she must first pay the money
which he may demand, and must also have his permission, although he
himself may send her to her parents whenever he chooses, without
assigning any reason.He retains the children, and he may marry again.The woman is generally expected to bring her husband a considerable sum
in the way of dowry, but, on separation, she gets nothing back.This was
the Boab's account, but I think he has overdone the harshness and
injustice of the Mohammedan law of marriage in relating it to our
tourists.It may be observed that the strict law is rarely acted upon,
and many respectable Moors have told me that they have but one wife, and
find that quite enough.It is true that many Moors, especially learned
men, divorce their wives when they get old, feeling the women an
embarrassment to them, and no wonder, when we consider these poor
creatures have no education, and, in their old age, neither afford
connubial pleasure nor society to their husbands.With respect to
divorce, a woman can demand by law and right to be separated from her
husband, or divorced, whenever he ill-treats her, or estranges himself
from her.Eunuchs, who have the charge of the women, are allowed to
marry, although they cannot have any family.The chief eunuch of the
Bardo has the most revolting countenance.Our tourists brought home a variety of curious Jereed things: small
date-baskets full of dates, woollen articles, skins of all sorts, and a
few live animals.Sidi Mohammed also made them many handsome presents.Some deer, Jereed goats, an ostrich, &c., were sent to Mr.R. after his
return, and both Captain B. and Mr.R. have had every reason to be
extremely gratified with the hospitality and kind attentions of the "Bey
of the Camp."It is very difficult to ascertain the amount of tribute collected in the
Jereed, some of which, however, was not got in, owing to various
impediments.Our tourists say generally:--

  Camel-loads.[40]
  Money, dollars, and piastres, (chiefly I
  imagine, the latter.)23

  Burnouses, blankets, and quilts, &c.6

  Dates (these were collected at Toser,
    and brought from Nefta and the surrounding
    districts)                                     500
                                                  ----
                 Total                             529

  It is impossible, with this statement
    before us, to make out any exact
    calculation of the amount of tribute.A cantar of dates varies from fifteen
    to twenty-five shillings, say on an
    average a pound sterling; this will
    make the amount of the 500 camel-loads
    at five cantars per load                    L2,500

  Six camel-loads of woollen manufactures,
    &c., at sixty pound per load, value            360
                                                ------
                   Total                        L2,860

The money, chiefly piastres, must be left to conjecture.Levy, a large merchant at Tunis, thinks the amount might be from 150 to
200,000 piastres, or, taking the largest sum, L6,250 sterling:

  Total amount of the tribute of the Jereed:
  in goods                                      L2,860
  Ditto, in money:                               6,250
                                                ------
                   Total                        L9,110

To this sum may be added the smaller presents of horses, camels, and
other beasts of burden.*       *       *       *       *

Before leaving Mogador, in company with Mr.Willshire, I saw his
Excellency, the Governor again, when I took formal leave of him.He
accompanied me down to the port with several of the authorities, waiting
until I embarked for the Renshaw schooner.Several of the Consuls, and
nearly all the Europeans, were also present.On the whole, I was
satisfied with the civilities of the Moorish authorities, and offer my
cordial thanks to the Europeans of Mogador for their attentions during
my residence in that city.A little circumstance shews the subjection of our merchants, the Consul
not excepted, to the Moorish Government.One of the merchants wished to
accompany me on board, but was not permitted, on account of his
engagements with the Sultan.A merchant cannot even go off the harbour to superintend the stowing of
his goods.Never were prisoners of war, or political offenders, so
closely watched as the boasted imperial merchants of this city.After setting sail, we were soon out of sight of Mogador; and, on the
following day, land disappeared altogether.During the next month, we
were at sea, and out of view of the shore.I find an entry in my
journal, when off the Isle of Wight.We had had most tremendous weather,
successive gales of foul wind, from north and north-east.Our schooner
was a beautiful vessel, a fine sailer with a flat bottom, drawing little
water, made purposely for Barbary ports.She had her bows completely
under water, and pitched her way for twenty-five succeeding days,
through huge rising waves of sea and foam.During the whole of this
time, I never got up, and lived on bread and water with a little
biscuit.Captain Taylor, who was a capital seaman, and took the most
accurate observations, lost all patience, and, though a good methodist,
would now and then rush on deck, and swear at the perverse gale and
wrathful sea.We took on board a fine barb for Mr.Elton, which died
after a few days at sea, in these tempests.I had a young vulture that
died a day before the horse, or we should have fed him on the carcase.[Illustration]

An aoudad which we conveyed on account of Mr.Willshire to London, for
the Zoological Society, outlived these violent gales, and was safely and
comfortably lodged in the Regent's Park.After my return from Africa, I
paid my brave and hardy fellow-passenger a visit, and find the air of
smoky London agrees with him as well as the cloudless region of the
Morocco Desert.The following account of the bombardment of Mogador by the French,
written at the period by an English Resident may be of interest at the
present time.Mogador was bombarded on the 13th of August, 1844.Hostilities began at
9 o'clock A.M., by the Moors firing twenty-one guns before the French
had taken up their position, but the fire was not returned until 2 P.M.The 'Gemappes,' 100; 'Suffren,' 99; 'Triton,' 80; ships of the line.'Belle Poule,' 60, frigate; 'Asmodee' and 'Pluton,' steamers, and some
brigs, constituted the bombarding squadron.The batteries were silenced,
and the Moorish authorities with many of the inhabitants fled, leaving
the city unprotected against the wild tribes, who this evening and the
next morning, sacked and fired the city.On the 16th, nine hundred
French were landed on the isle of Mogador.After a rude encounter with
the garrison, they took possession of it and its forts.Their loss was,
after twenty-eight hours' bombarding, trifling, some twenty killed and
as many more wounded; the Moors lost some five hundred on the isle
killed, besides the casualties in the city.The British Consul and his wife, and Mr.Robertson, with
others, were obliged to remain in the town during the bombardment on
account of their liabilities to the Emperor.The escape of these people
from destruction was most miraculous.The bombarding squadron reached on the 10th, the English frigate,
'Warspite,' on the 13th, and the wind blowing strong from N.E., and
preventing the commencement of hostilities, afforded opportunity to
save, if possible, the British Consul's family and other detained
Europeans; but, notwithstanding the strenuous remonstrances of the
captain of the 'Warspite', nothing whatever could prevail upon the
Moorish Deputy-Governor in command, Sidi Abdallah Deleero, to allow the
British and other Europeans to take their departure.The Governor even
peremptorily refused permission for the wife of the Consul to leave,
upon the cruel sophism that, "The Christian religion asserts the husband
and wife to be one, consequently," added the Governor, "as it is my
duty, which I owe to my Emperor, to prevent the Consul from leaving
Mogador, I must also keep his wife."The fact is the Moors, in their stupidity, and perhaps in their revenge,
thought the retaining of the British Consul and the Europeans might, in
some way or other, contribute to the defence of themselves, save the
city, or mitigate the havoc of the bombardment.At any rate, they would
say, "Let the Christians share the same fate and dangers as ourselves."During the bombardment, the Moors for two hours fought well, but their
best gunner, a Spanish renegade, Omar Ei-Haj, being killed, they became
dispirited and abandoned the batteries.The Governor and his troops,
about sunset, disgracefully and precipitately fled, followed by nearly
all the Moorish population, thereby abandoning Mogador to pillage, and
the European Jews to the merciless wild tribes, who, though levied to
defend the town, had, for some hours past, hovered round it like droves
of famished wolves.As the Governor fled out, terrified as much at the wild tribes as of the
French, in rushed these hordes, led on by their desperate chiefs.These
wretches undismayed, unmoved by the terrors of the bombarding ravages
around, strove and vied with each other in the committal of every act of
the most unlicensed ferocity and depredation, breaking open houses,
assaulting the inmates, murdering such as shewed resistance, denuding
the more submissive of their clothing, abusing women--particularly in
the Jewish quarter--to all which atrocities the Europeans were likewise
exposed.At the most imminent hazard of their lives, the British Consul and his
wife, with a few others, escaped from these ruffians.Truly providential
was their flight through streets, resounding with the most turbulent
confusion and sanguinary violence.It was late when the plunderers
appeared before the Consulates, where, without any ceremony, by
hundreds, they fell to work, breaking open bales of goods, ransacking
places for money and other treasures; and, thus unsatisfied in their
rapacity, they tore and burnt all the account-books and Consular
documents.Other gangs fought over the spoil; some carrying off their booty, and
others setting it on fire.It was a real pandemonium of discord and
licentiousness.During the darkness, and in the midst of such scenes, it
was that the Consul and his wife threaded their precarious flight
through the streets, and in their way were intercepted by a marauding
band, who attacked them; tore off his coat; and, seizing his wife,
insisted upon denuding her, four or five daggers being raised to her
throat, expecting to find money concealed about their persons; nor would
the ruffians desist until they ascertained they had none, the Consul
having prudently resolved to take no money with them.Fortunately, at
this juncture, his wife was able to speak, and in Arabic (being born
here, and daughter of a former Consul), therefore she could give force
to her entreaties by appealing to them not to imbue their hands in the
blood of their countrywomen.The chief of
the party undertook to conduct them to the water-port, when, coming in
contact with another party, a conflict about booty ensued, during which
the Consul's family got out of the town to a place of comparative
security.Incidents of a similar alarming nature attended the escape of Mr.Robertson, his wife, and four children; one, a baby in arms.Robertson, with a child in each hand, lost sight of Mrs.Robertson, with her infant and another child.Distracted by sad
forebodings, poor Mr.Robertson forced his way to the water-port, but
not before a savage mountainer--riding furiously by him--aimed a
sabre-blow at him to cut him down; but, as the murderous arm was poised
above, Mr.Robertson stooped, and, raising his arm at the time, warded
it off; the miscreant then rode off, being satisfied at this cut at the
detested Nazarene.Another ruffian seized one of his little girls, a pretty child of nine
years old, and scratched her arm several times with his dagger, calling
out _flous_ (money) at each stroke.Robertson
joined his fainting wife, and the British Consul and his wife, with Mr.An old Moor never deserted the Consul's family,
"faithful among the faithless;" and a Jewess, much attached to the
family, abandoned them only to return to those allied to her by the ties
of blood.Their situation was now still perilous, for, should they be discovered
by the wild Berbers, they all might be murdered.This night, the 15th,
was a most anxious one, and their apprehensions were dreadful.Dawn of
day was fast approaching, and every hour's delay rendered their
condition more precarious.Lucas, who never once
failed or lost his accustomed suavity and presence of mind amidst these
imminent dangers, resolved upon communicating with the fleet by a most
hazardous experiment.On his way from the town-gate to the water-port,
he noticed some deal planks near the beach.The idea struck him of
turning these into a raft, which, supporting him, could enable their
party to communicate with the squadron.Lucas fetched the planks,
and resolutely set to work.Taking three of them, and luckily finding a
quantity of strong grass cordage, he arranged them in the water, and
with some cross-pieces, bound the whole together; and, besides, having
found two small pieces of board to serve him as paddles, he gallantly
launched forth alone, and, in about an hour, effected his object, for he
excited the attention of the French brig, 'Canard,' from which a boat
came and took him on board.The officers, being assured there were no Moors on guard at the
batteries, and that the Berbers were wholly occupied in plundering the
city, promptly and generously sent off a boat with Mr.Lucas to the
rescue of the alarmed and trembling fugitives.The Prince de Joinville
afterwards ordered them to be conveyed on board the 'Warspite.'The
self-devotedness, sagacity, and indefatigable exertions of the excellent
young man, Mr.Lucas, were above all encomiums, and, at the hands of the
British Government, he deserved some especial mark of favour.Levy (an English Jewess, married to a Maroquine Jew), and her
family were left behind, and accompanied the rest of the miserable Jews
and natives, to be maltreated, stripped naked, and, perhaps, murdered,
like many poor Jews.Amrem Elmelek, the greatest native merchant and
a Jew, died from fright.Carlos Bolelli, a Roman, perished during the
sack of the city.Mogador was left a heap of ruins, scarcely one house standing entire,
and all tenantless.In the fine elegiac bulletin of the bombarding
Prince, "Alas!thy walls are riddled with bullets,
and thy mosques of prayer blackened with fire!"Tangier trades almost exclusively with Gibraltar, between which place
and this, an active intercourse is constantly kept up.The principal articles of importation into Tangier are, cotton goods of
all kinds, cloth, silk-stuffs, velvets, copper, iron, steel, and
hardware of every description; cochineal, indigo, and other dyes; tea,
coffee, sulphur, paper, planks, looking-glasses, tin, thread,
glass-beads, alum, playing-cards, incense, sarsaparilla, and rum.The exports consist in hides, wax, wool, leeches, dates, almonds,
oranges, and other fruit, bark, flax, durra, chick-peas, bird-seed, oxen
and sheep, henna, and other dyes, woollen sashes, haicks, Moorish
slippers, poultry, eggs, flour, &c.

The value of British and foreign goods imported into Tangier in 1856
was: British goods, L101,773 6_s_., foreign goods, L33,793.The goods exported from Tangier during the same year was: For British
ports, L63,580 10_s_., for foreign ports, L13,683.The following is a statement of the number of British and foreign ships
that entered and cleared from this port during the same year.Entered:
British ships 203, the united tonnage of which was 10,883; foreign ships
110, the total tonnage of which was 4,780.Cleared: British ships 207, the united tonnage of which was 10,934;
foreign ships 110, the total tonnage of which was 4,780.Three thousand head of cattle are annually exported, at a fixed duty of
five dollars per head, to Gibraltar, for the use of that garrison, in
conformity with the terms of special grants that have, from time to
time, been made by the present Sultan and some of his predecessors.In
addition to the above, about 2,000 head are, likewise, exported
annually, for the same destination, at a higher rate of duty, varying
from eight dollars to ten dollars per head.Gibraltar, also, draws from
this place large supplies of poultry, eggs, flour, and other kinds of
provisions.From the port of Mogador are exported the richest articles the country
produces, viz., almonds, sweet and bitter gums, wool, olive-oil, seeds
of various kinds, as cummin, gingelen, aniseed; sheep-skins, calf, and
goat-skins, ostrich-feathers, and occasionally maize.The amount of exports in 1855 was: For British ports, L228,112 3_s_.2_d_., for foreign ports, L55,965 13_s_.The imports are Manchester cotton goods, which have entirely superseded
the East India long cloths, formerly in universal use, blue salampores,
prints, sugar, tea, coffee, Buenos Ayres slides, iron, steel, spices,
drugs, nails, beads and deals, woollen cloth, cotton wool, and mirrors
of small value, partly for consumption in the town, but chiefly for that
of the interior, from Morocco and its environs, as far as Timbuctoo.The amount of imports in 1855 was: British goods, L136,496 7_s_.6_d_.,
foreign goods L31,222 11_s_.The trade last year was greatly increased by the unusually large demand
for olive-oil from all parts, and there is no doubt that, under a more
liberal Government, the commerce might be developed to a vast extent.The principal goods imported at Rabat are, alum, calico of different
qualities, cinnamon, fine cloth, army cloth, cloves, copperas, cotton
prints, raw cotton, sewing cotton, cutlery, dimity, domestics,
earthenware, ginger, glass, handkerchiefs (silk and cotton), hardware,
indigo, iron, linen, madder root, muslin, sugar (refined and raw), tea,
and tin plate.The before-mentioned articles are imported partly for consumption in
Rabat and Sallee, and partly for transmission into the interior.The value of different articles of produce exported at Rabat during the
last five years amounts to L34,860 1_s_.There can be no doubt that the imports and exports at Rabat would
greatly increase, if the present high duties were reduced, and
Government monopolies abolished.Large quantities of hides were exported
before they were a Government monopoly: now the quantity exported is
very inconsiderable._Goods Imported_.--Brown Domestics, called American White, muslins, raw
cotton, cotton-bales, silk and cotton pocket-handkerchiefs; tea, coffee,
sugars, iron, copperas, alum; many other articles imported, but in very
small quantities.A small portion of the importations is consumed at Mazagan and Azimore,
but the major portions in the interior.The amount of the leading goods exported in 1855 was:--Bales of wool,
6,410; almonds, 200 serons; grain, 642,930 fanegas.No doubt the commerce of this port would be increased under better
fiscal laws than those now established.But the primary and immediate thing to be looked after is the wilful
casting into the anchorage-ground of stone-ballast by foreigners.British masters are under control, but foreigners will persist, chiefly
Sardinian masters.THE END




[1] The predecessor of Muley Abd Errahman.[2] On account, of their once possessing the throne, the Shereefs have a
peculiar jealousy of Marabouts, and which latter have not forgotten
their once being sovereigns of Morocco.The _Moravedi_ were "really a
dynasty of priests," as the celebrated Magi, who usurped the throne of
Cyrus.The Shereefs, though descended from the Prophet, are not strictly
priests, or, to make the distinction perfectly clear the Shereefs are to
be considered a dynasty corresponding to the type of Melchizdek, uniting
in themselves the regal and sacerdotal authority, whilst the
_Marabouteen_ were a family of priests like the sons of Aaron.Abd-el-Kader unites in himself the princely and sacerdotal authority
like the Shereefs, though not of the family of the Prophet.Mankind have
always been jealous of mere theocratic government, and dynasties of
priests have always been failures in the arts of governing, and the
Egyptian priests, though they struggled hard, and were the most
accomplished of this class of men, could not make themselves the
sovereigns of Egypt.[3] According to others the Sadia reigned before the Shereefs.[4] I was greatly astonished to read in Mr.Hay's "Western Barbary," (p.123), these words--"During one of the late rebellions, a beautiful young
girl was offered up as a propitiatory sacrifice, her throat being cut
before the tent of the Sultan, and in his presence!"This is an
unmitigated libel on the Shereefian prince ruling Morocco.First of all,
the sacrifice of human beings is repudiated by every class of
inhabitants in Barbary.Such rites, indeed, are unheard of, nay,
unthought of.If the Mahometan religion has been powerful in any one
thing, it is in that of rooting out from the mind of man every notion of
human sacrifice.It is this which makes the sacrifice of the Saviour
such an obnoxious doctrine to Mussulmen.It is true enough, at times,
oxen are immolated to God, but not to Moorish princes, "to appease an
offended potentate."One spring, when there was a great drought, the
people led up to the hill of Ghamart, near Carthage, a red heifer to be
slaughtered, in order to appease the displeasure of Deity; and when the
Bey's frigate, which, a short time ago, carried a present to her
Britannic Majesty, from Tunis to Malta, put back by stress of weather,
two sheep were sacrificed to some tutelar saints, and two guns were
fired in their honour.The companions of Abd-el-Kader in a storm, during
his passage from Oran to Toulon, threw handsful of salt to the raging
deep to appease its wild fury.But as to sacrificing human victims,
either to an incensed Deity, or to man, impiously putting himself in the
place of God, the Moors of Barbary have not the least conception of such
an enormity.It would seem, unfortunately, that the practice of the gentleman, who
travelled a few miles into the interior of Morocco on a horse-mission,
had been to exaggerate everything, and, where effect was wanting, not to
have scrupled to have recourse to unadulterated invention.But this
style of writing cannot be defended on any principle, when so serious a
case is brought forward as that of sacrificing a human victim to appease
the wrath of an incensed sovereign, and that prince now living in
amicable relations with ourselves.[5] Graeberg de Hemso, whilst consul-general for Sweden and Sardinia (at
Morocco!)concludes the genealogy of these Mussulman sovereigns with
this strange, but Catholic-spirited rhapsody:--

"Muley Abd-ur-Bakliman, who is now gloriously and happily reigning, whom
we pray Almighty God, all Goodness and Power, to protect and exalt by
prolonging his life, glory, and reign in this world and in the next; and
giving him, during eternity, the heavenly beatitude, in order that his
soul, in the same manner as flame to flame, river to sea, may be united
with his sweetest, most perfect and ineffable Creator.[6] Yezeed was half-Irish, born of the renegade widow of an Irish
sergeant of the corps of Sappers and Miners, who was placed at the
disposition of this government by England, and who died in Morocco.On
his death, the facile, buxom widow was admitted, "nothing loath," into
the harem of Sidi-Mohammed, who boasted of having within its sacred
enclosure of love and bliss, a woman from every clime.Here the daughter of Erin brought forth this ferocious tyrant, whose
maxim of carnage, and of inflicting suffering on humanity was, "My
empire can never be well governed, unless a stream of blood flows from
the gate of the palace to the gate of the city."To do Yezeed justice,
he followed out the instincts of his birth, and made war on all the
world except the English (or Irish).Tully's Letters on Tripoli give a
graphic account of the exploits of Yezeed, who, to his inherent cruelty,
added a fondness for practical (Hibernian) jokes.His father sent him several times on a pilgrimage to Mecca to expiate
his crimes, when he amused, or alarmed, all the people whose countries
he passed through, by his terrific vagaries.One day he would cut off
the heads of a couple of his domestics, and play at bowls with them;
another day, he would ride across the path of an European, or a consul,
and singe his whiskers with the discharge of a pistol-shot; another day,
he would collect all the poor of a district, and gorge them with a
razzia he had made on the effects of some rich over-fed Bashaw.The
multitude sometimes implored heaven's blessing on the head of Yezeed.at
other times trembled for their own heads.Meanwhile, our European
consuls made profound obeisance to this son of the Shereef, enthroned in
the West.So the tyrant passed the innocent days of his pilgrimage.So
the godless herd of mankind acquiesced in the divine rights of royalty.[7] See Appendix at the end of this volume.[8] The middle Western Region consists of Algiers and part of Tunis.[9] Pliny, the Elder, confirms this tradition mentioned by Pliny.Marcus
Yarron reports, "that in all Spain there are spread Iberians, Persians,
Phoenicians, Celts, and Carthaginians."[10] In Latin, Mauri, Maurice, Maurici, Maurusci, and it is supposed, so
called by the Greeks from their dark complexions.[11] The more probable derivation of this word is from _bar_, signifying
land, or earth, in contradistinction from the sea, or desert, beyond the
cultivable lands to the South.To give the term more force it is
doubled, after the style of the Semitic reduplication.De Haedo de la
Captividad gives a characteristic derivation, like a genuine hidalgo,
who proclaimed eternal war against Los Moros.He says--"Moors, Alartes,
Cabayles, and some Turks, form all of them a dirty, lazy, inhuman,
indomitable nation of beasts, and it is for this reason that, for the
last few years, I have accustomed myself to call that land the land of
Barbary."[12] Procopius, de Bello Vandilico, lib.[13] Some derive it from _Sarak_, an Arabic word which signifies to
steal, and hence, call the conquerors thieves.Others, and with more
probability, derive it from _Sharak_, the east, and make them Orientals,
and others say there is an Arabic word _Saracini_, which means a
pastoral people, and assert that Saracine is a corruption from it, the
new Arabian immigrants being supposed to have been pastoral tribes.[14] Some suppose that _Amayeegh_ means "great," and the tribes thus
distinguished themselves, as our neighbours are wont to do by the phrase
"la grande nation."The Shoulah are vulgarly considered to be descended
from the Philistines, and to have fled before Joshua on the conquest of
Palestine.In his translation of the Description of Spain, by the Shereef El-Edris
(Madrid, 1799), Don Josef Antonio Conde speaks of the Berbers in a
note--

"Masmuda, one of the five principal tribes of Barbaria; the others are
Zeneta, called Zenetes in our novels and histories, Sanhagha which we
name Zenagas; Gomesa is spelt in our histories Gomares and Gomeles.Huroara, some of these were originally from Arabia; there were others,
but not so distinguished.La de Ketama was, according to tradition,
African, one of the most ancient, for having come with Afrikio."Ben Kis Ben Taifi Ben Teba, the younger, who came from the king of the
Assyrians, to the land of the west."None of these primitive tribes appear to have been known to the Romans,
their historians, however, have transmitted to us many names of other
aboriginal tribes, some of which resemble fractions now existing, as the
Getules are probably the present Geudala or Geuzoula.But the present
Berbers do not correspond with the names of the five original people
just mentioned.In Morocco, there are Amayeegh and Shelouh, in Algeria
the Kabyles, in Tunis the Aoures, sometimes the Shouwiah, and in Sahara
the Touarichs.There are, besides, numerous subdivisions and admixtures
of these tribes."[15] Monsieur Balbi is decidedly the most recent, as well as the best
authority to apply to for a short and definite description of this most
celebrated mountain system, called by him "Systeme Atlantique," and I
shall therefore annex what he says on this interesting subject,
"Orographie."He says--"Of the 'Systeme Atlantique,' which derives its
name from the Mount Atlas, renowned for so many centuries, and still so
little known; we include in this vast system, all the heights of the
region of Maghreb--we mean the mountain of the Barbary States--as well
as the elevations scattered in the immense Sahara or Desert.It appears
that the most important ridge extends from the neighbourhood of Cape
Noun, or the Atlantic, as far as the east of the Great Syrte in the
State of Tripoli.In this vast space it crosses the new State of
Sidi-Hesdham, the Empire of Morocco, the former State of Algiers, as
well as the State of Tripoli and the Regency of Tunis.It is in the
Empire of Morocco, and especially in the east of the town of Morocco,
and in the south-east of Fez, that that ridge presents the greatest
heights of the whole system.It goes on diminishing afterwards in height
as it extends towards the east, so that it appears the summits of the
territory of Algiers are higher than those on the territory of Tunis,
and the latter are less high than those to be found in the State of
Tripoli.Several secondary ridges diverge in different directions from
the principal chain; we shall name among them the one which ends at the
Strait of Gibraltar in the Empire of Morocco.Several intermediary
mountains seem to connect with one another the secondary chains which
intersect the territories of Algiers and Tunis.Geographers call Little
Atlas the secondary mountains of the land of Sous, in opposition to the
name of Great Atlas, they give to the high mountains of the Empire of
Morocco.In that part of the principal chain called Mount Gharian, in
the south of Tripoli, several low branches branch off and under the
names of Mounts Maray, Black Mount Haroudje, Mount Liberty, Mount
Tiggerandoumma and others less known, furrow the great solitudes of the
Desert of Lybia and Sahara Proper.From observations made on the spot by
Mr.Bruguiere in the former state of Algiers, the great chain which
several geographers traced beyond the Little Atlas under the name of
Great Atlas does not exist.The inhabitants of Mediah who were
questioned on the subject by this traveller, told him positively, that
the way from that town to the Sahara was through a ground more or less
elevated, and <DW72>s more or less steep, and without having any chain of
mountains to cross.The Pass of Teniah which leads from Algiers to
Mediah is, therefore, included in the principal chain of that part of
the Regency.[16] Xenophon, in his Anabasis, speaks of ostriches in Mesopotamia being
run down by fleet horses.[17] Mount Atlas was called Dyris by the ancient aborigines, or Derem,
its name amongst the modern aborigines.This word has been compared to
the Hebrew, signifying the place or aspect of the sun at noon-day, as if
Mount Atlas was the back of the world, or the cultivated parts of the
globe, and over which the sun was seen at full noon, in all his fierce
and glorious splendour.Bochart connects the term with the Hebrew
meaning 'great' or'mighty,' which epithet would be naturally applied to
the Atlas, and all mountains, by either a savage or civilized people.We
have, also, on the northern coast, Russadirum, the name given by the
Moors to Cape Bon, which is evidently a compound of _Ras_, head, and
_dirum_, mountain, or the head of the mountain.We have again the root of this word in Doa-el-Hamman, Tibet Deera, &c.,
the names of separate chains of the mighty Atlas.Any way, the modern
Der-en is seen to be the same with the ancient Dir-is.[18] The only way of obtaining any information at all, is through the
registers of taxation; and, to the despotism and exactions of these and
most governments, we owe a knowledge of the proximate amount of the
numbers of mankind.[19] Tangier, Mogador, Wadnoun, and Sous have already been described,
wholly, or in part.[20] In 936, Arzila was sacked by the English, and remained for twenty
years uninhabited.Hay, a portion of the Salee Rovers seem to have
finally taken refuge here.Up the river El-Kous, the Imperial squadron
lay in ordinary, consisting of a corvette, two brigs, (once
merchant-vessels, and which had been bought of Christians), and a
schooner, with some few gun-boats, and even these two or three vessels
were said to be all unfit for sea.But, when Great Britain captured the
rock of Gibraltar, we, supplanting the Moors became the formidable
toll-keepers of the Herculean Straits, and the Salee rivers have ever
since been in our power.If the Shereefs have levied war or tribute on
European navies since that periods it has been under our tacit sanction.The opinion of Nelson is not the less true, that, should England engage
in war with any maritime State of Europe, Morocco must be our warm and
active friend or enemy, and, if our enemy, we must again possess
ourselves of our old garrison of Tangier.[22] So called, it is supposed, from the quantity of aniseed grown in
the neighbourhood.[23] Near Cape Blanco is the ruined town of Tit or Tet, supposed to be
of Carthaginian origin, and once also possessed by the Portuguese, when
commerce therein flourished.[24] El-Kesar is a very common name of a fortified town, and is usually
written by the Spaniards Alcazar, being the name of the celebrated royal
palace at Seville.[25] Marmol makes this city to have succeeded the ancient Roman town of
Silda or Gilda.Mequinez has been called Ez-Zetounah, from the immense
quantities of olives in its immediate vicinity.[26] Don J. A. Conde says--"Fes or sea Fez, the capital of the realm of
that name; the fables of its origin, and the grandeur of the Moors, who
always speak of their cities as foundations of heroes, or lords of the
whole world, &c., a foible of which our historians are guilty.Nasir-Eddin and the same Ullug Beig say, for certain, that Fez is the
court of the king in the west.I must observe here, that nothing is less
authentic than the opinions given by Casiri in his Library of the
Escurial, that by the word Algarb, they always mean the west of Spain,
and by the word Almagreb, the west of Africa; one of these appellations
is generally used for the other.The same Casiri says, with regard to
Fez, that it was founded by Edno Ben Abdallah, under the reign of
Almansor Abu Giafar; he is quite satisfied with that assertion, but does
not perceive that it contains a glaring anachronism.Fez was already a
very ancient city before the Mohammed Anuabi of the Mussulmen, and
Joseph, in his A. J., mentions a city of Mauritania; the prophet Nahum
speaks of it also, when he addresses Ninive, he presents it as an
example for No Ammon.He enumerates its districts and cities, and says,
Fut and Lubim, Fez and Lybia, &c.[27] I imagine we shall never know the truth of this until the French
march an army into Fez, and sack the library.[28] It is true enough what the governor says about _quietness_, but the
novelty of the mission turned the heads of the people, and made a great
noise among them.The slave-dealers of Sous vowed vengeance against me,
and threatened to "rip open my bowels" if I went down there.[29] The Sultan's Minister, Ben Oris, addressing our government on the
question says, "Whosoever sets any person free God will set his soul
free from the fire," (hell), quoting the Koran.[30] A person going to the Emperor without a present, is like a menace
at court, for a present corresponds to our "good morning."[31] _Bash_, means chief, as Bash-Mameluke, chief of the Mamelukes.[32] This office answers vulgarly to our _Boots_ at English inns.[33] Bismilla, Arabic for "In the name of God!"the Mohammedan grace
before meat, and also drink.[34] Shaw says.--"The hobara is of the bigness of a capon, it feeds upon
the little grubs or insects, and frequents the confines of the Desert.The body is of a light dun or yellowish colour, and marked over with
little brown touches, whilst the larger feathers of the wing are black,
with each of them a white spot near the middle; those of the neck are
whitish with black streaks, and are long and erected when the bird is
attacked.The bill is flat like the starling's, nearly an inch and a
half long, and the legs agree in shape and in the want of the hinder toe
with the bustard's, but it is not, as Golins says, the bustard, that
bird being twice as big as the hobara.Nothing can be more entertaining
than to see this bird pursued by the hawk, and what a variety of flights
and stratagems it makes use of to escape."The French call the hobara, a
little bustard, _poule de Carthage_, or Carthage-fowl.They are
frequently sold in the market of Tunis, as ordinary fowls, but eat
something like pheasant, and their flesh is red.[35] The most grandly beautiful view in Tunis is that from the
Belvidere, about a mile north-west from the capital, looking immediately
over the Marsa road.Here, on a hill of very moderate elevation, you
have the most beautiful as well as the most magnificent panoramic view
of sea and lake, mountain and plain, town and village, in the whole
Regency, or perhaps in any other part of North Africa.There are besides
many lovely walks around the capital, particularly among and around the
craggy heights of the south-east.But these are little frequented by the
European residents, the women especially, who are so stay-at-homeative
that the greater part of them never walked round the suburbs once in
their lives.Europeans generally prefer the Marina, lined on each side,
not with pleasant trees, but dead animals, sending forth a most
offensive smell.[36] Shaw says: "The rhaad, or safsaf, is a granivorous and gregarious
bird, which wanteth the hinder toe.There are two species, and both
about and a little larger than the ordinary pullet.The belly of both is
white, back and wings of a buff colour spotted with brown, tail lighter
and marked all along with black transverse streaks, beak and legs
stronger than the partridge.The name rhaad, "thunder," is given to it
from the noise it makes on the ground when it rises, safsaf, from its
beating the air, a sound imitating the motion."[37] Ghafsa, whose name Bochart derives from the Hebrew "comprimere,"
is an ancient city, claiming as its august founder, the Libyan
Hercules.It was one of the principal towns in the dominions of
Jugurtha, and well-fortified, rendered secure by being placed in the
midst of immense deserts, fabled to have been inhabited solely by
snakes and serpents.Marius took it by a _coup-de-main_, and put all
the inhabitants to the sword.The modern city is built on a gentle
eminence, between two arid mountains, and, in a great part, with the
materials of the ancient one.Ghafsa has no wall of _euceinte_, or
rather a ruined wall surrounds it, and is defended by a kasbah,
containing a small garrison.This place may be called the gate of the
Tunisian Sahara; it is the limit of Blad-el-Jereed; the sands begin now
to disappear, and the land becomes better, and more suited to the
cultivation of corn.Three villages are situated in the environs, Sala,
El-Kesir, and El-Ghetar.A fraction of the tribe of Hammand deposit
their grain in Ghafsa.This town is famous for its manufactories of
baraeans and blankets ornamented with pretty  flowers.There is
also a nitre and powder-manufactory, the former obtained from the earth
by a very rude process.The environs are beautifully laid out in plantations of the fig, the
pomegranate, and the orange, and especially the datepalm, and the
olive-tree.The oil made here is of peculiarly good quality, and is
exported to Tugurt, and other oases of the Desert.[38] Kaemtz's Meteorology, p.[39] This is the national dish of Barbary, and is a preparation of
wheat-flour granulated, boiled by the steam of meat.It is most
nutritive, and is eaten with or without meat and vegetables.When the
grains are large, it is called hamza.[40] A camel-load is about five cantars, and a cantar is a hundred
weight.[Transcriber's Note: In this electronic edition, the footnotes were

whether Lee would move against him or would follow McClellan in the
latter's retreat from the Peninsula; nor did he know when the
reenforcements promised from McClellan's army would reach him.Meanwhile
Lee had decided to let McClellan depart in peace and to advance against
Pope, with the whole Confederate army.To this end Longstreet was ordered
to the scene and with his corps he reached Gordonsville on August 13th.A few days later the two Confederate generals, Lee and Longstreet,
ascended to the top of Clark's Mountain, from which, through powerful
field-glasses, they obtained a good view of Culpeper, about twelve miles
away.They saw that Pope's position was weak and determined to attack him
without delay.Lee ordered his army to cross the Rapidan.He also sent a
courier to gallop across the country with an important dispatch to General
Stuart, disclosing his plans.It was now that General Pope met fortune; he
captured the courier and learned of Lee's plans.Pope knew that he was not
in position to meet Lee's army at Culpeper, and he withdrew from that
place and took up a strong position behind the Rappahannock.Lee had
strained every nerve to get at his antagonist before the latter left
Culpeper and before he could be reenforced by McClellan's army.But sudden
rains changed the Rappahannock from a placid stream into a rushing
torrent.The Confederates were delayed and meantime the reenforcements
from the Peninsula began to reach Pope's army.General Reno with a part of
Burnside's corps was on the ground by August 14th.One week later came
Generals Kearny and Reynolds--both splendid leaders, both destined to give
their lives for their country within a year--to join the Army of Virginia
with some thousands of additional fighters from the Army of the Potomac.Lee was completely thwarted in his purpose of attacking Pope before his
reenforcements arrived.He sent the dauntless cavalry
leader, J. E. B. Stuart, to make a raid around the Union army.Stuart did
this effectively, and this was the first of the two notable events of
these weeks of sparring.Crossing the Rappahannock at Waterloo Bridge with
fifteen hundred mounted men as bold and dauntless as himself, Stuart
dashed up the country, riding all day and all night.After the coming of
night on the evening of the 22d, in the midst of a torrential rainstorm,
while the darkness was so intense that every man was guided by the tread
of his brother horsemen, Stuart pounced upon the Federals near Catlett's
Station, overpowered the astonished guard, captured nearly two hundred
prisoners, scattering the remainder of the troops stationed there far and
wide in the darkness, and seized Pope's despatch-book with his plans and
private papers.Stuart took also several hundred fine horses and burned a
large number of wagons laden with supplies.Among his trophies was a fine
uniform cloak and hat which were the personal property of General Pope.These were exchanged on the following day for General Stuart's plumed hat
which a few days before had been left behind by that officer when
surprised by Federal troops.Stuart's bold raid proved a serious misfortune for the Union army.But Lee
had far greater things in store.His next move was to send Jackson to
Pope's rear with a large part of the Confederate army.Stealthily Jackson
led his army westward, shielded by the woods, the thickets, and the low
hills of the Blue Ridge.It was a quiet rural community through which he
passed.The great majority of the simple country folk had never seen an
army, though it is true that for many days the far-away boom of cannon had
reached their ears from the valley of the Rapidan.Now here was a real
army at their very doors.Nor was it a hostile army, for their sympathies
were Southern.With baskets and armfuls of bread and pies and cakes they
cheered as best they could the tattered and hungry men on the march.General Lee in the meantime had kept Longstreet in front of Pope's army on
the Rappahannock to make daily demonstrations and feints and thus to
divert Pope's attention from Jackson's movements and lead him to believe
that he was to be attacked in front."Stonewall" Jackson suddenly, on August 26th, emerged from the Bull Run
Mountains by way of the Thoroughfare Gap and marshaled his clans on the
plains of Manassas, but a few miles from the site of the famous battle of
the year before.He was astonished to find Jackson in his rear, and
he had to decide instantly between two courses to abandon his
communications with Fredericksburg on the one hand, or with Alexandria and
Washington on the other.He decided to keep in touch with Washington at
all hazards.Breaking his camp on the Rappahannock, he hastened with all
speed to lead his forces toward Manassas Junction, where he had stored
vast quantities of provisions and munitions of war.But he was too late to
save them.Jackson had been joined by Stuart and his cavalry.On the
evening of the 26th they were still some miles from Manassas and Trimble
was sent ahead to make sure the capture before Pope's army could arrive.Through the darkness rode these same hardy men who had a few nights before
made their bold raid on Catlett's Station.The
spoils of this capture were great, including three hundred prisoners, one
hundred and seventy-five horses, ten locomotives, seven long trains of
provisions, and vast stores and munitions of war.Next morning the weary and hungry foot soldiers of Jackson's army came
upon the scene and whatever else they did they feasted as only hungry men
can.An eye-witness wrote, "To see a starving man eating lobster-salad
and drinking Rhine wine, barefooted and in tatters, was curious; the
whole thing was incredible."The amazement at the North when the news of the capture of Manassas became
known cannot be described.But the newspapers belittled it, declaring that
it was merely a bold raid and that for any large force to get between
Pope's army and Washington before Pope became aware of the attempt was
simply impossible.But his position was precarious,
nevertheless.Pope was moving toward him with a far larger army, recently
augmented by Heintzelman's corps from the Army of the Potomac, while Fitz
John Porter with an additional force was not far off.It is true that
Longstreet was hastening to the aid of Jackson, but he had to come by the
same route which had brought Jackson--through Thoroughfare Gap--and Pope
thought he saw a great opportunity.If he could only detain Longstreet at
the gap, why should he not crush Jackson with his superior numbers?To
this end he sent orders to Porter, to McDowell, and to Kearny and others
whose forces were scattered about the country, to concentrate during the
night of the 27th and move upon Jackson.McDowell sent Ricketts with a
small force--too small to prevent Longstreet from passing through
Thoroughfare Gap, and hastened to join the main army against Jackson.But
that able commander was not to be caught in a trap.He moved from Manassas
Junction by three roads toward the old battle-field of Bull Run and by
noon on the 28th the whole corps was once more united between Centreville
and Sudley Spring.Late in the day he encountered King's division of
McDowell's corps near the village of Groveton, and a sharp fight was
opened and kept up till an hour after dark.The Confederates were left in
possession of the field.The following day, August 29th, was the first of the two days' battle,
leaving out of account the fight of the evening before and the desultory
fighting of the preceding ten days.General Pope was still hopeful of
crushing Jackson before the arrival of Longstreet, and on the morning of
the 29th he ordered a general advance across Bull Run.As the noon hour
approached a wild shout that arose from Jackson's men told too well of the
arrival of Longstreet.Far away on the hills near Gainesville could be
seen the marching columns of Longstreet, who had passed through the gap in
safety and who was now rushing to the support of Jackson.The Confederate
army was at last to be reunited.Pope had
lost his opportunity of fighting the army of his opponent in sections.The field was almost the same that the opposing forces had occupied a year
and a month before when the first great battle of the war was fought.And
many of them were the same men.Some who had engaged in that first
conflict had gone home and had refused to reenlist; others had found
soldiers' graves since then--but still others on both sides were here
again, no longer the raw recruits that they were before, but, with their
year of hard experience in the field, they were trained soldiers, equal to
any in the world.The two armies faced each other in a line nearly five miles long.There
was heavy fighting here and there along the line from the early morning
hours, but no general engagement until late in the afternoon.The Union
right pressed hard against the Confederate left and by ten o'clock had
forced it back more than a mile.But the Confederates, presently
reenforced in that quarter, hurled heavy masses of infantry against the
Union right and regained much that it had lost.Late in the afternoon
fresh regiments under Kearny and Hooker charged the Confederate left,
which was swept back and rolled in upon the center.But presently the
Southern General Hood, with his famous Texan brigade, rushed forward in a
wild, irresistible dash, pressed Kearny back, captured one gun, several
flags and a hundred prisoners.Night then closed over the scene and the
two armies rested on their arms until the morning.The first day's battle is sometimes called the battle of Groveton, but
usually it is considered as the first half of the second battle of Bull
Run.The Union loss was at least
forty-five hundred men, the Confederate was somewhat larger.Over the gory
field lay multitudes of men, the blue and the gray commingled, who would
dream of battlefields no more.The living men lay down among the dead in
order to snatch a little rest and strength that they might renew the
strife in the morning.It is a strange fact that Lee and Pope each believed that the other would
withdraw his army during the night, and each was surprised in the morning
to find his opponent still on the ground, ready, waiting, defiant.It was
quite certain that on this day, August 30th, there would be a decisive
action and that one of the two armies would be victor and the other
defeated.The two opposing commanders had called in their outlying
battalions and the armies now faced each other in almost full force, the
Confederates with over fifty thousand men and the Union forces exceeding
their opponents by probably fifteen thousand men.The Confederate left
wing was commanded by Jackson, and the right by Longstreet.The extreme
left of the Union army was under Fitz John Porter, who, owing to a
misunderstanding of orders, had not reached the field the day before.The
center was commanded by Heintzelman and the right by Reno.In the early hours of the morning the hills echoed with the firing of
artillery, with which the day was opened.Porter made an infantry attack
in the forenoon, but was met by the enemy in vastly superior numbers and
was soon pressed back in great confusion.As the hours passed one fearful
attack followed another, each side in turn pressing forward and again
receding.In the afternoon a large part of the Union army made a
desperate onslaught on the Confederate left under Jackson.Here for some
time the slaughter of men was fearful.Jackson saw
that his lines were wavering.He called for reenforcements which did not
come and it seemed as if the Federals were about to win a signal victory.Far away on a little hill at the Confederate right
Longstreet placed four batteries in such a position that he could enfilade
the Federal columns.Quickly he trained his cannon on the Federal lines
that were hammering away at Jackson, and opened fire.Ghastly gaps were
soon cut in the Federal ranks and they fell back.But they re-formed and
came again and still again, each time only to be mercilessly cut down by
Longstreet's artillery.At length Longstreet's whole line rushed forward,
and with the coming of darkness, the whole Union front began to waver.General Lee, seeing this, ordered the Confederates in all parts of the
field to advance.It was now dark
and there was little more fighting; but Lee captured several thousand
prisoners.Pope retreated across Bull Run with the remnant of his army and
by morning was ensconced behind the field-works at Centreville.There was no mistaking the fact that General Pope had lost the battle and
the campaign.He decided to lead his army back to the entrenchments of
Washington.After spending a day behind the embankments at Centreville,
the retreat was begun.Lee's troops with Jackson in the advance pursued
and struck a portion of the retreating army at Chantilly.It was late in the afternoon of September 1st.The rain, accompanied by
vivid lightning and terrific crashes of thunder, was falling in torrents
as Stuart's horsemen, sent in advance, were driven back by the Federal
infantry.Jackson now pushed two of A. P. Hill's brigades forward to
ascertain the condition of the Union army.General Reno was protecting
Pope's right flank, and he lost no time in proceeding against Hill.The
latter was promptly checked, and both forces took position for battle.One side and then the other fell back in turn as lines were re-formed and
urged forward.Night fell and the tempest's fury increased.The ammunition
of both armies was so wet that much of it could not be used.Try as they
would the Confederates were unable to break the Union line and the two
armies finally withdrew.The Confederates suffered a loss of five hundred
men in their unsuccessful attempt to demoralize Pope in his retreat, and
the Federals more than a thousand, including Generals Stevens and Kearny.General Kearny might have been saved but for his reckless bravery.He was
rounding up the retreat of his men in the darkness of the night when he
chanced to come within the Confederate lines.Called on to surrender, he
lay flat on his horse's back, sank his spurs into its sides, and attempted
to escape.Half a dozen muskets were leveled and fired at the fleeing
general.Within thirty yards he rolled from his horse's back dead.The consternation in Washington and throughout the North when Pope's
defeated army reached Arlington Heights can better be imagined than
described.General Pope, who bore the brunt of public indignation, begged
to be relieved of the command.The President complied with his wishes and
the disorganized remnants of the Army of Virginia and the Army of the
Potomac were handed to the "Little Napoleon" of Peninsula fame, George B.
McClellan.The South was overjoyed with its victory--twice it had unfurled its banner
in triumph on the battlefield at Manassas by the remarkable strategy of
its generals and the courage of its warriors on the firing-line.Twice it
had stood literally on the road that led to the capital of the Republic,
only by some strange destiny of war to fail to enter its precincts on the
wave of victory.[Illustration: THE UNHEEDED WARNING

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here we see Catlett's Station, on the Orange & Alexandria Railroad, which
Stuart's cavalry seized in a night sortie on August 22, 1862.Stuart was unable to burn the loaded wagon-trains
surrounding the station and had to content himself with capturing horses,
which he mounted with wounded Federal soldiers; he escaped at four the
next morning, driven off by the approach of a superior force.Pope, at the
time, was in possession of the fords of the Rappahannock, trying to check
the Confederate advance toward the Shenandoah.Stuart's raid, however, so
alarmed General Halleck that he immediately telegraphed Pope from
Washington: "By no means expose your railroad communication with
Alexandria.It is of the utmost importance in sending your supplies and
reinforcements."Pope did not fall back upon his railroad communication,
however, until after Jackson had seized Manassas Junction.[Illustration: CATLETT'S STATION]

At Manassas Junction, as it appeared in the upper picture on August 26,
1862, is one of the great neglected strategic points in the theater of the
war.Twenty-five miles from Alexandria and thirty miles in a direct line
from Washington, it was almost within long cannon-shot from any point in
both the luckless battles of Bull Run.It was on the railway route
connecting with Richmond, and at the junction of the railway running
across the entrance to the Shenandoah Valley and beyond the Blue Ridge,
through Manassas Gap.The Confederates knew its value, and after the first
battle of Bull Run built the fortifications which we see in the upper
picture, to the left beyond the supply-cars on the railroad.Pope, after
the battle of Cedar Mountain, should have covered it, extending his lines
so as to protect it from Jackson's incursion through Thoroughfare Gap;
instead he held the main force of his army opposing that of Lee.[Illustration: WHERE THE THUNDERBOLT FELL

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The havoc wrought by the Confederate attack of August 26th on the Federal
supply depot at Manassas Junction is here graphically preserved.When
Jackson arrived at sunset of that day at Bristoe's Station, on the Orange
& Alexandria Railroad, he knew that his daring movement would be reported
to Pope's forces by the trains that escaped both north and south.To save
themselves, the troops that had already marched twenty-five miles had to
make still further exertions.Trimble volunteered to move on Manassas
Junction; and, under command of Stuart, a small force moved northward
through the woods.At midnight it arrived within half a mile of the
Junction.The Federal force greeted it with artillery fire, but when the
Confederates charged at the sound of the bugle the gunners abandoned the
batteries to the assaulters.Some three hundred of the small Federal
garrison were captured, with the immense stores that filled the warehouses
to overflowing.The next morning Hill's and Taliaferro's divisions arrived
to hold the position.The half-starved troops were now in possession of
all that was needed to make them an effective force.Jackson was now in
position to control the movements of the Federal army under Pope.[Illustration: GUARDING THE "O.NEAR UNION MILLS

and the single-track railroad was inadequate.[Illustration: DEBRIS FROM JACKSON'S RAID ON THE ORANGE AND ALEXANDRIA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This is part of the result of General Pope's too rapid advance to head off
Lee's army south of the Rappahannock River.Although overtaking the
advance of the Confederates at Cedar Mountain, Pope had arrived too late
to close the river passes against them.Meanwhile he had left the Orange &
Alexandria Railroad uncovered, and Jackson pushed a large force under
General Ewell forward across the Bull Run Mountains.On the night of
August 26, 1863, Ewell's forces captured Manassas Junction, while four
miles above the Confederate cavalry fell upon an empty railroad train
returning from the transfer of Federal troops.Here we see how well the work was done.THE TRAIN "STONEWALL" JACKSON AND STUART STOPPED AT BRISTOE

[Illustration]

By a move of unparalleled boldness, "Stonewall" Jackson, with twenty
thousand men, captured the immense Union supplies at Manassas Junction,
August 26, 1862.Washington lay one day's
march to the north; Warrenton, Pope's headquarters, but twelve miles
distant to the southwest; and along the Rappahannock, between "Stonewall"
Jackson and Lee, stood the tents of another host which outnumbered the
whole Confederate army."Stonewall" Jackson had seized Bristoe Station in
order to break down the railway bridge over Broad Run, and to proceed at
his leisure with the destruction of the stores.A train returning empty
from Warrenton Junction to Alexandria darted through the station under
heavy fire.Two trains which followed in
the same direction as the first went crashing down a high embankment.The
report received at Alexandria from the train which escaped ran as follows:
"No.6 train, engine Secretary, was fired into at Bristoe by a party of
cavalry some five hundred strong.They had piled ties on the track, but
the engine threw them off.It
was a full day before the Federals realized that "Stonewall" Jackson was
really there with a large force.Here, in abundance, was all that had been
absent for some time; besides commissary stores of all sorts, there were
two trains loaded with new clothing, to say nothing of sutler's stores,
replete with "extras" not enumerated in the regulations, and also the camp
of a cavalry regiment which had vacated in favor of Jackson's men.It was
an interesting sight to see the hungry, travel-worn men attacking this
profusion and rewarding themselves for all their fatigues and deprivations
of the preceding few days, and their enjoyment of it and of the day's rest
allowed them.There was a great deal of difficulty for a time in finding
what each man needed most, but this was overcome through a crude barter of
belongings as the day wore on.[Illustration]


[Illustration: A START TOO LONG DELAYED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Where the troops of General McClellan, waiting near the round-house at
Alexandria, were hurried forward to the scene of action where Pope was
struggling with Jackson and Ewell.Pope had counted upon the assistance of
these reenforcements in making the forward movement by which he expected
to hold Lee back.The old bogey of leaving the National Capital
defenseless set up a vacillation in General Halleck's mind and the troops
were held overlong at Alexandria.Had they been promptly forwarded,
"Stonewall" Jackson's blow at Manassas Junction could not have been
struck.At the news of that disaster the troops were hurriedly despatched
down the railroad toward Manassas.But Pope was already in retreat in
three columns toward that point, McDowell had failed to intercept the
Confederate reenforcements coming through Thoroughfare Gap, and the
situation had become critical.General Taylor, with his brigade of New
Jersey troops, was the first of McClellan's forces to be moved forward to
the aid of Pope.At Union Mills, Colonel Scammon, commanding the First
Brigade, driven back from Manassas Junction, was further pressed by the
Confederates on the morning of August 27th.Later in the day General
Taylor's brigade arrived by the Fairfax road and, crossing the railroad
bridge, met the Confederates drawn up and waiting near Manassas Station.A
severe artillery fire greeted the Federals as they emerged from the woods.As General Taylor had no artillery, he was obliged either to retire or
charge.When the Confederate cavalry threatened to
surround his small force, however, Taylor fell back in good order across
the bridge, where two Ohio regiments assisted in holding the Confederates
in check.At this point, General Taylor, who had been wounded in the
retreat, was borne past in a litter.Though suffering much, he appealed to
the officers to prevent another Bull Run.The brigade retired in good
order to Fairfax Court House, where General Taylor died of his wounds a
short time afterward.[Illustration: BRIGADIER-GENERAL GEORGE W. TAYLOR]


[Illustration: AN UNREALIZED OPPORTUNITY]

Here might have been won a Federal victory that would have precluded
defeat at Second Bull Run.The corps of General Heintzelman, consisting of
the divisions of Hooker and Kearny, was the next detachment of McClellan's
forces to arrive to the aid of Pope.On the 28th of August, Heintzelman
had pushed forward to Centreville, entering it soon after "Stonewall"
Jackson's rear-guard had retired.Instead of pursuing, Heintzelman drew up
his forces east of Cub Run, which we see in the picture.Jackson's forces,
now in a precarious position, fell back toward Thoroughfare Gap to form a
junction with Longstreet's Corps, which Lee had sent forward.The battle
was commenced on the west somewhat feebly by Generals McDowell and Sigel.By nightfall the Confederate left had been driven back fully a mile.[Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL SAMUEL P. HEINTZELMAN AND STAFF

Sleeping on their arms on the night of August 29th, the Federal veterans
were as confident of having won a victory as were the raw troops in the
beginning of the first battle of Bull Run.But the next day's fighting was
to tell the tale.General Ewell had been wounded in the knee by a minie
ball in the severe fight at Groveton and was unable to lead his command;
but for the impetuosity of this commander was substituted that of
Longstreet, nicknamed "the War-Horse," whose arrival in the midst of the
previous day's engagement had cost the Federals dear.On the morning of
the second day Longstreet's batteries opened the engagement.When the
general advance came, as the sun shone on the parallel lines of glittering
bayonets, it was Longstreet's men bringing their muskets to "the ready"
who first opened fire with a long flash of flame.It was they who pressed
most eagerly forward and, in the face of the Federal batteries, fell upon
the troops of General McDowell at the left and drove them irresistibly
back.Although the right Federal wing, in command of General Heintzelman,
had not given an inch, it was this turning of the left by Longstreet which
put the whole Federal army in retreat, driving them across Bull Run.The
Confederates were left in possession of the field, where lay thousands of
Federal dead and wounded, and Lee was free to advance his victorious
troops into the North unmolested.[Illustration: THE BATTLE-FIELD OF SECOND BULL RUN (MANASSAS), AUGUST

"Make Buell, Grant, and Pope major-generals of volunteers and give me

ANTIETAM, OR SHARPSBURG

    At Sharpsburg (Antietam) was sprung the keystone of the arch upon
    which the Confederate cause rested.--_James Longstreet,
    Lieutenant-General C. S. A., in "Battles and Leaders of the Civil
    War."_


A battle remarkable in its actualities but more wonderful in its
possibilities was that of Antietam, with the preceding capture of Harper's
Ferry and the other interesting events that marked the invasion of
Maryland by General Lee.It was one of the bloodiest and the most
picturesque conflicts of the Civil War, and while it was not all that the
North was demanding and not all that many military critics think it might
have been, it enabled President Lincoln to feel that he could with some
assurance issue, as he did, his Emancipation Proclamation.Lee's army, fifty thousand strong, had crossed the Potomac at Leesburg and
had concentrated around Frederick, the scene of the Barbara Frietchie
legend, only forty miles from Washington.When it became known that Lee,
elated by his victory at Second Bull Run, had taken the daring step of
advancing into Maryland, and now threatened the capital of the Republic,
McClellan, commanding the Army of the Potomac, pushed his forces forward
to encounter the invaders.Harper's Ferry, at the junction of the Potomac
and the Shenandoah rivers, was a valuable defense against invasion through
the Valley of Virginia, but once the Confederates had crossed it, a
veritable trap.General Halleck ordered it held and General Lee sent
"Stonewall" Jackson to take it, by attacking the fortress on the Virginia
side.Jackson began his march on September 10th with secret instructions from
his commander to encompass and capture the Federal garrison and the vast
store of war material at this place, made famous a few years before by old
John Brown.To conceal his purpose from the inhabitants he inquired along
the route about the roads leading into Pennsylvania.It was from his march
through Frederick that the Barbara Frietchie story took its rise.But
there is every reason to believe that General Jackson never saw the good
old lady, that the story is a myth, and that Mr.Whittier, who has given
us the popular poem under the title of her name, was misinformed.However,
Colonel H. K. Douglas, who was a member of Jackson's staff, relates, in
"Battles and Leaders of the Civil War," an interesting incident where his
commander on entering Middletown was greeted by two young girls waving a
Union flag.The general bowed to the young women, raised his hat, and
remarked to some of his officers, "We evidently have no friends in this
town."Colonel Douglas concludes, "This is about the way he would have
treated Barbara Frietchie."On the day after Jackson left Frederick he crossed the Potomac by means of
a ford near Williamsport and on the 13th he reached Bolivar Heights.Harper's Ferry lies in a deep basin formed by Maryland Heights on the
north bank of the Potomac, Loudon Heights on the south bank, and Bolivar
Heights on the west.The Shenandoah River breaks through the pass between
Loudon and Bolivar Heights and the village lies between the two at the
apex formed by the junction of the two rivers.As Jackson approached the place by way of Bolivar Heights, Walker occupied
Loudon Heights and McLaws invested Maryland Heights.All were unopposed
except McLaws, who encountered Colonel Ford with a force to dispute his
ascent.Ford, however, after some resistance, spiked his guns and retired
to the Ferry, where Colonel Miles had remained with the greater portion of
the Federal troops.Had Miles led his entire force to Maryland Heights he
could no doubt have held his ground until McClellan came to his relief.But General Halleck had ordered him to hold Harper's Ferry to the last,
and Miles interpreted this order to mean that he must hold the town
itself.He therefore failed to occupy the heights around it in sufficient
strength and thus permitted himself to be caught in a trap.During the day of the 14th the Confederate artillery was dragged up the
mountain sides, and in the afternoon a heavy fire was opened on the doomed
Federal garrison.On that day McClellan received word from Miles that the
latter could hold out for two days longer and the commanding general sent
word: "Hold out to the last extremity.If it is possible, reoccupy the
Maryland Heights with your entire force.If you can do that I will
certainly be able to relieve you.... Hold out to the last."McClellan was
approaching slowly and felt confident he could relieve the place.On the morning of the 15th the roar of Confederate artillery again
resounded from hill to hill.From Loudon to Maryland Heights the firing
had begun and a little later the battle-flags of A. P. Hill rose on
Bolivar Heights.Scarcely two hours had the firing continued when Colonel
Miles raised the white flag at Harper's Ferry and its garrison of 12,500,
with vast military stores, passed into the hands of the Confederates.Colonel Miles was struck by a stray fragment of a Confederate shell which
gave him a mortal wound.The force of General Franklin, preparing to move
to the garrison's relief, on the morning of the 15th noted that firing at
the Ferry had ceased and suspected that the garrison had surrendered, as
it had.The Confederate Colonel Douglas, whose account of the surrender is both
absorbing and authoritative, thus describes the surrender in "Battles and
Leaders of the Civil War":

"Under instructions from General Jackson, I rode up the pike and into the
enemy's lines to ascertain the purpose of the white flag.Near the top of
the hill I met General White and staff and told him my mission.He replied
that Colonel Miles had been mortally wounded, that he was in command and
desired to have an interview with General Jackson.... I conducted them to
General Jackson, whom I found sitting on his horse where I had left
him.... The contrast in appearances there presented was striking.General
White, riding a handsome black horse, was carefully dressed and had on
untarnished gloves, boots, and sword.His staff were equally comely in
costume.On the other hand, General Jackson was the dingiest,
worst-dressed and worst-mounted general that a warrior who cared for good
looks and style would wish to surrender to."General Jackson... rode up to Bolivar and down into Harper's Ferry.The
curiosity in the Union army to see him was so great that the soldiers
lined the sides of the road.... One man had an echo of response all about
him when he said aloud: 'Boys, he's not much for looks, but if we'd had
him we wouldn't have been caught in this trap.'"McClellan had failed to reach Harper's Ferry in time to relieve it because
he was detained at South Mountain by a considerable portion of Lee's army
under D. H. Hill and Longstreet.McClellan had come into possession of
Lee's general order, outlining the campaign.Discovering by this order
that Lee had sent Jackson to attack Harper's Ferry he made every effort to
relieve it.The affair at Harper's Ferry, as that at South Mountain, was but a prelude
to the tremendous battle that was to follow two days later on the banks of
the little stream called Antietam Creek, in Maryland.When it was known
that Lee had led his army across the Potomac the people were filled with
consternation--the people, not only of the immediate vicinity, but of
Harrisburg, of Baltimore, of Philadelphia.Their fear was intensified by
the memory of the Second Bull Run of a few weeks earlier, and by the fact
that at this very time General Bragg was marching northward across
Kentucky with a great army, menacing Louisville and Cincinnati.As one year before, the hopes of the North had centered in George B.
McClellan, so it was now with the people of the East.They were ready to
forget his failure to capture Richmond in the early summer and to contrast
his partial successes on the Peninsula with the drastic defeat of his
successor at the Second Bull Run.When McClellan, therefore, passed through Maryland to the scene of the
coming battle, many of the people received him with joy and enthusiasm.At
Frederick City, he tells us in his "Own Story," he was "nearly overwhelmed
and pulled to pieces," and the people invited him into their houses and
gave him every demonstration of confidence.The first encounter, a double one, took place on September 14th, at two
passes of South Mountain, a continuation of the Blue Ridge, north of the
Potomac.General Franklin, who had been sent to relieve Harper's Ferry,
met a Confederate force at Crampton's Gap and defeated it in a sharp
battle of three hours' duration.Meanwhile, the First and Ninth Army
Corps, under Burnside, encountered a stronger force at Turner's Gap seven
miles farther up.The battle here continued many hours, till late in the
night, and the Union troops were victorious.Lee's loss was nearly twenty-seven hundred, of whom eight hundred were
prisoners.The Federals lost twenty-one hundred men and they failed to
save Harper's Ferry.Lee now placed Longstreet and D. H. Hill in a strong position near
Keedysville, but learning that McClellan was advancing rapidly, the
Confederate leader decided to retire to Sharpsburg, where he could be more
easily joined by Jackson.September 16th was a day of intense anxiety and
unrest in the valley of the Antietam.The people who had lived in the
farmhouses that dotted the golden autumn landscape in this hitherto quiet
community had now abandoned their homes and given place to the armed
forces.It was a day of marshaling and maneuvering of the gathering
thousands, preparatory to the mighty conflict that was clearly seen to be
inevitable.Lee had taken a strong position on the west bank of Antietam
Creek a few miles from where it flows into the Potomac.He made a display
of force, exposing his men to the fire of the Federal artillery, his
object being to await the coming of Jackson's command from Harper's Ferry.It is true that Jackson himself had arrived, but his men were weary with
marching and, moreover, a large portion of his troops under A. P. Hill and
McLaws had not yet reached the field.McClellan spent the day arranging his corps and giving directions for
planting batteries.With a few companions he rode along the whole front,
frequently drawing the fire of the Confederate batteries and thus
revealing their location.The right wing of his army, the corps of
Generals Hooker, Mansfield, and Sumner, lay to the north, near the village
of Keedysville.General Porter with two divisions of the Fifth Corps
occupied the center and Burnside was on the left of the Union lines.Back
of McClellan's lines was a ridge on which was a signal station commanding
a view of the entire field.Late on the afternoon of the 16th, Hooker
crossing the Antietam, advanced against Hood's division on the Confederate
left.For several hours there was heavy skirmishing, which closed with the
coming of darkness.The two great armies now lay facing each other in a grand double line
three miles in length.At one point (the Union right and the Confederate
left) they were so near together that the pickets could hear each other's
tread.It required no prophet to foretell what would happen on the morrow.Beautiful and clear the morning broke over the Maryland hills on the
fateful 17th of September, 1862.The sunlight had not yet crowned the
hilltops when artillery fire announced the opening of the battle.Hooker's
infantry soon entered into the action and encountered the Confederates in
an open field, from which the latter were presently pressed back across
the Hagerstown pike to a line of woods where they made a determined stand.Hooker then called on General Mansfield to come to his aid, and the latter
quickly did so, for he had led his corps across the Antietam after dark
the night before.Mansfield, however, a gallant and honored veteran, fell
mortally wounded while deploying his troops, and General Alpheus S.
Williams, at the head of his first division, succeeded to the command.There was a wood west of the Sharpsburg and Hagerstown turnpike which,
with its outcropping ledges of rock, formed an excellent retreat for the
Confederates and from this they pushed their columns into the open fields,
chiefly of corn, to meet the Union attacks.For about two hours the battle
raged at this point, the lines swaying to and fro, with fearful slaughter
on both sides.At length, General Greene, who commanded a division of the
fallen Mansfield's corps, gained possession of part of the coveted forest,
near a little white church, known as the Dunker's Chapel.This was on high
ground and was the key to the Confederate left wing.But Greene's troops
were exposed to a galling fire from D. H. Hill's division and he called
for reenforcements.General Sumner then sent Sedgwick's division across the stream and
accompanied the troops to the aid of their hard-pressed comrades.And the
experience of this body of the gallant Second Corps during the next hour
was probably the most thrilling episode of the whole day's battle.Sedgwick's troops advanced straight toward the conflict.They found Hooker
wounded and his and Williams' troops quite exhausted.A sharp artillery
fire was turned on Sedgwick before he reached the woods west of the
Hagerstown pike, but once in the shelter of the thick trees he passed in
safety to the western edge.Heavy Confederate reenforcements--ten brigades, in fact--Walker's men, and
McLaws', having arrived from Harper's Ferry--were hastening up, and they
not only blocked the front, but worked around to the rear of Sedgwick's
isolated brigades.Sedgwick was wounded in the awful slaughter that
followed, but he and Sumner finally extricated their men with a loss of
two thousand, over three hundred left dead on the ghastly field.Franklin
now sent forward some fresh troops and after obstinately fighting, the
Federals finally held a cornfield and most of the coveted wood over which
the conflict had raged till the ground was saturated with blood.Before the close of this bloody conflict on the Union right another,
almost if not quite as deadly, was in progress near the center.General
French, soon joined by General Richardson, both of Sumner's corps, crossed
the stream and made a desperate assault against the Southerners of D. H.
Hill's division, stationed to the south of where the battle had previously
raged--French on a line of heights strongly held by the Confederates,
Richardson in the direction of a sunken road, since known as "Bloody
Lane."The fighting here was of a most desperate character and continued
nearly four hours.French captured a few flags, several hundred prisoners,
and gained some ground, but he failed to carry the heights.Richardson was
mortally wounded while leading a charge and was succeeded by General
Hancock; but his men finally captured Bloody Lane with the three hundred
living men who had remained to defend it.The final Federal charge at this
point was made by Colonel Barlow, who displayed the utmost bravery and
self-possession in the thickest of the fight, where he won a
brigadier-generalship.He was wounded, and later carried off the field.The Confederates had fought desperately to hold their position in Bloody
Lane, and when it was captured it was filled with dead bodies.It was now
about one o'clock and the infantry firing ceased for the day on the Union
right, and center.Let us now look on the other part of the field.Burnside held the Federal
left wing against Lee's right, and he remained inactive for some hours
after the battle had begun at the other end of the line.In front of
Burnside was a triple-arched stone bridge across the Antietam, since known
as "Burnside's Bridge."Opposite this bridge, on the <DW72> which extends
to a high ridge, were Confederate breastworks and rifle-pits, which
commanded the bridge with a direct or enfilading fire.While the Federal
right was fighting on the morning of the 17th, McClellan sent an order to
Burnside to advance on the bridge, to take possession of it and cross the
stream by means of it.It must have been about ten o'clock when Burnside
received the order as McClellan was more than two miles away.Burnside's chief officer at this moment was General Jacob D. Cox
(afterward Governor of Ohio), who had succeeded General Reno, killed at
South Mountain.On Cox fell the task of capturing the stone bridge.The
defense of the bridge was in the hands of General Robert Toombs, a former
United States senator and a member of Jefferson Davis' Cabinet.Perhaps
the most notable single event in the life of General Toombs was his
holding of the Burnside Bridge at Antietam for three hours against the
assaults of the Federal troops.The Confederates had been weakened at this
point by the sending of Walker to the support of Jackson, where, as we
have noticed, he took part in the deadly assault upon Sedgwick's division.Toombs, therefore, with his one brigade had a heavy task before him in
defending the bridge with his small force, notwithstanding his advantage
of position.McClellan sent several urgent orders to advance at all hazards.Burnside
forwarded these to Cox, and in the fear that the latter would be unable to
carry the bridge by a direct front attack, he sent Rodman with a division
to cross the creek by a ford some distance below.Meanwhile, in rapid succession, one assault after
another was made upon the bridge and, about one o'clock, it was carried,
at the cost of five hundred men.A lull in the
fighting along the whole line of battle now ensued.Burnside, however, received another order from McClellan to push on up the
heights and to the village of Sharpsburg.The great importance of this
move, if successful, was that it would cut Lee out from his line of
retreat by way of Shepherdstown.After replenishing the ammunition and adding some fresh troops, Cox
advanced at three o'clock with the utmost gallantry toward Sharpsburg.The
Confederates disputed the ground with great bravery.But Cox swept all
before him and was at the edge of the village when he was suddenly
confronted by lines in blue uniforms who instantly opened fire.The
Federals were astonished to see the blue-clad battalions before them.They
must be Union soldiers; but how did they get there?They were A. P. Hill's division of Lee's army which had just
arrived from Harper's Ferry, and they had dressed themselves in the
uniforms that they had taken from the Federal stores.Hill had come just in time to save Lee's headquarters from capture.He
checked Cox's advance, threw a portion of the troops into great confusion,
and steadily pressed them back toward the Antietam.In this, the end of
the battle, General Rodman fell mortally wounded.Cox retired in good
order and Sharpsburg remained in the hands of the Confederates.Thus, with the approach of nightfall, closed the memorable battle of
Antietam.For fourteen long hours more than one hundred thousand men, with
five hundred pieces of artillery, had engaged in titanic combat.As the
pall of battle smoke rose and cleared away, the scene presented was one to
make the stoutest heart shudder.There lay upon the ground, scattered for
three miles over the valleys and the hills or in the improvised hospitals,
more than twenty thousand men.Horace Greeley was probably right in
pronouncing this the bloodiest day in American history.Although tactically it was a drawn battle, Antietam was decisively in
favor of the North inasmuch as it ended the first Confederate attempt at a
Northern invasion.General Lee realized that his ulterior plans had been
thwarted by this engagement and after a consultation with his corps
commanders he determined to withdraw from Maryland.On the night of the
18th the retreat began and early the next morning the Confederate army had
all safely recrossed the Potomac.The great mistake of the Maryland campaign from the standpoint of the
Confederate forces, thought General Longstreet, was the division of Lee's
army, and he believed that if Lee had kept his forces together he would
not have been forced to abandon the campaign.At Antietam, he had less
than forty thousand men, who were in poor condition for battle while
McClellan had about eighty-seven thousand, most of whom were fresh and
strong, though not more than sixty thousand were in action.The moral effect of the battle of Antietam was incalculably great.It
aroused the confidence of the Northern people.It emboldened President
Lincoln to issue five days after its close the proclamation freeing the
slaves in the seceded states.He had written the proclamation long before,
but it had lain inactive in his desk at Washington.All through the
struggles of the summer of 1862 he had looked forward to the time when he
could announce his decision to the people.With the doubtful success of Federal arms, to make such a bold step would
have been a mockery and would have defeated the very end he sought.The South had now struck its first desperate blow at the gateways to the
North.By daring, almost unparalleled in warfare, it had swung its
courageous army into a strategical position where with the stroke of
fortune it might have hammered down the defenses of the National capital
on the south and then sweep on a march of invasion into the North.The
Northern soldiers had parried the blow.They had saved themselves from
disaster and had held back the tide of the Confederacy as it beat against
the Mason and Dixon line, forcing it back into the State of Virginia where
the two mighty fighting bodies were soon to meet again in a desperate
struggle for the right-of-way at Fredericksburg.[Illustration: JEFFERSON DAVIS

ACCORDING TO HIS WIDOW THE ONLY WAR-TIME PHOTOGRAPH OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE CONFEDERACY

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Thus appeared Jefferson Davis, who on the eve of Antietam was facing one
of the gravest crises of his career.Eighteen months previously, on
February 9, 1861, he had been unanimously elected president of the
Confederate States of America.He maintained
that the secession of the Southern states should be regarded as a purely
peaceful move.But events had swiftly drawn him and his government into
the most stupendous civil conflict of modern times.Now, in September,
1862, he was awaiting the decision of fate.The Southern forces had
advanced northward triumphantly.Elated by success, they were at this
moment invading the territory of the enemy under the leadership of Lee,
whose victories had everywhere inspired not only confidence but enthusiasm
and devotion.Should he overthrow the Northern armies, the Confederacy
would be recognized abroad and its independence probably established at
home.Should he be defeated, no one could foretell the result.From this time the fortunes of the Confederacy waned.[Illustration: LEE LOCKS THE GATES

COPYRIGHT 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Sharpsburg, Maryland, September 17, 1862.There were long minutes on that
sunny day in the early fall of 1862 when Robert E. Lee, at his
headquarters west of Sharpsburg, must have been in almost entire ignorance
of how the battle went.Outnumbered he knew his troops were; outfought he
knew they never would be.Longstreet, Hood, D. H. Hill, Evans, and D. R.
Jones had turned back more than one charge in the morning; but, as the day
wore on, Lee perceived that the center must be held.He had deceived McClellan as to his numerical strength and he must
continue to do so.At one time
General Longstreet reported from the center to General Chilton, Lee's
Chief of Staff, that Cooke's North Carolina regiment--still keeping its
colors at the front--had not a cartridge left.None but veteran troops
could hold a line like this, supported by only two guns of Miller's
battery of the Washington Artillery.Of this crisis in the battle General
Longstreet wrote afterward: "We were already badly whipped and were
holding our ground by sheer force of desperation."Actually in line that
day on the Confederate side were only 37,000 men, and opposed to them were
numbers that could be footed up to 50,000 more.At what time in the day
General Lee must have perceived that the invasion of Maryland must come to
an end cannot be told.He had lost 20,000 of his tired, footsore army by
straggling on the march, according to the report of Longstreet, who adds:
"Nearly one-fourth of the troops who went into the battle were killed or
wounded."At dark Lee's rearward movement had begun.[Illustration: A REGIMENT THAT FOUGHT AT SOUTH MOUNTAIN--THE THIRTY-FIFTH

Early in the morning of September 17, 1862, Knap's battery (shown below)
got into the thick of the action of Antietam.General Mansfield had posted
it opposite the north end of the West Woods, close to the Confederate
line.The guns opened fire at seven o'clock.Practically unsupported, the
battery was twice charged upon during the morning; but quickly
substituting canister for shot and shell, the men held their ground and
stemmed the Confederate advance.Near this spot General Mansfield was
mortally wounded while deploying his troops.About noon a section of
Knap's battery was detached to the assistance of General Greene, in the
East Woods.[Illustration: KNAP'S BATTERY, JUST AFTER THE BLOODY WORK AT ANTIETAM

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.This photograph was taken back of the rail fence on the Hagerstown pike,
where "Stonewall" Jackson's men attempted to rally in the face of Hooker's
ferocious charge that opened the bloodiest day of the Civil War--September
17, 1862.Hooker, advancing to seize high ground nearly three-quarters of
a mile distant, had not gone far before the glint of the rising sun
disclosed the bayonet-points of a large Confederate force standing in a
cornfield in his immediate front.This was a part of Jackson's Corps which
had arrived during the morning of the 16th from the capture of Harper's
Ferry and had been posted in this position to surprise Hooker in his
advance.The outcome was a terrible surprise to the Confederates.All of
Hooker's batteries hurried into action and opened with canister on the
cornfield.The Confederates stood bravely up against this fire, and as
Hooker's men advanced they made a determined resistance.Back and still
farther back were Jackson's men driven across the open field, every stalk
of corn in which was cut down by the battle as closely as a knife could
have done it.On the ground the slain lay in rows precisely as they had
stood in ranks.From the cornfield into a small patch of woods (the West
Woods) the Confederates were driven, leaving the sad result of the
surprise behind them.As the edge of the woods was approached by Hooker's
men the resistance became stronger and more stubborn.Nearly all the units
of two of Jackson's divisions were now in action, and cavalry and
artillery were aiding them."The two lines," says General Palfrey, "almost
tore each other to pieces."General Starke and Colonel Douglas on the
Confederate side were killed.More than half of Lawton's and Hays'
brigades were either killed or wounded.On the Federal side General
Ricketts lost a third of his division.The energy of both forces was
entirely spent and reinforcements were necessary before the battle could
be continued.Many of Jackson's men wore trousers and caps of Federal
blue, as did most of the troops which had been engaged with Jackson in the
affair at Harper's Ferry.A. P. Hill's men, arriving from Harper's Ferry
that same afternoon, were dressed in new Federal uniforms--a part of their
booty--and at first were mistaken for Federals by the friends who were
anxiously awaiting them.[Illustration: THE THRICE-FOUGHT GROUND

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The field beyond the leveled fence is covered with both Federal and
Confederate dead.Over this open space swept Sedgwick's division of
Sumner's Second Corps, after passing through the East and entering the
West Woods.This is near where the Confederate General Ewell's division,
reenforced by McLaws and Walker, fell upon Sedgwick's left flank and rear.Nearly two thousand Federal soldiers were struck down, the division losing
during the day more than forty per cent.One
regiment lost sixty per cent.--the highest regimental loss sustained.Later the right of the Confederate line crossed the turnpike at the Dunker
church (about half a mile to the left of the picture) and made two
assaults upon Greene, but they were repulsed with great slaughter.General
D. R. Jones, of Jackson's division, had been wounded.The brave Starke who
succeeded him was killed; and Lawton, who followed Starke, had fallen
wounded.[Illustration: RUIN OF MUMMA'S HOUSE, ANTIETAM]

A flaming mansion was the guidon for the extreme left of Greene's division
when (early in the morning) he had moved forward along the ridge leading
to the East Woods.This dwelling belonged to a planter by the name of
Mumma.It stood in the very center of the Federal advance, and also at the
extreme left of D. H. Hill's line.The house had been fired by the
Confederates, who feared that its thick walls might become a vantage-point
for the Federal infantry.It burned throughout the battle, the flames
subsiding only in the afternoon.Before it, just across the road, a
battery of the First Rhode Island Light Artillery had placed its guns.Twice were they charged, but each time they were repulsed.From Mumma's
house it was less than half a mile across the open field to the Dunker
church.The fence-rails in the upper picture were those of the field
enclosing Mumma's land, and the heroic dead pictured lying there were in
full sight from the burning mansion.[Illustration: THE HARVEST OF "BLOODY LANE"

blow of which the Federals could boast in the day's fighting at Antietam,
September 17, 1862.In the lower picture we see the officers whose work
first began to turn the tide of battle into a decisive advantage which the
Army of the Potomac had every reason to expect would be gained by its
superior numbers.On the Federal right Jackson, with a bare four thousand
men, had taken the fight out of Hooker's eighteen thousand in the morning,
giving ground at last to Sumner's fresh troops.On the Federal left,
Burnside (at the lower bridge) failed to advance against Longstreet's
Corps, two-thirds of which had been detached for service elsewhere.It was
at the center that the forces of French and Richardson, skilfully fought
by their leaders, broke through the Confederate lines and, sweeping beyond
the sunken road, seized the very citadel of the center.Meagher's Irish
Brigade had fought its way to a crest from which a plunging fire could be
poured upon the Confederates in the sunken road.Meagher's ammunition was
exhausted, and Caldwell threw his force into the position and continued
the terrible combat.When the Confederates executed their flanking
movement to the left, Colonel D. R. Cross, of the Fifth New Hampshire,
seized a position which exposed Hill's men to an enfilading fire.(In the

[Illustration: SHERRICK'S HOUSE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.In three distinct localities the battle waxed fierce from dawn to dusk on
that terrible day at Antietam, September 17, 1862.First at the Federal
right around the Dunker church; then at the sunken road, where the centers
of both armies spent themselves in sanguinary struggle; lastly, late in
the day, the struggle was renewed and ceased on the Sharpsburg road.When
Burnside finally got his troops in motion, Sturgis' division of the Ninth
Corps was first to cross the creek; his men advanced through an open
ravine under a withering fire till they gained the opposite crest and held
it until reenforced by Wilcox.To their right ran the Sharpsburg road, and
an advance was begun in the direction of the Sherrick house.[Illustration: GENERAL A. P. HILL, C. S.The fighting along the Sharpsburg road might have resulted in a
Confederate disaster had it not been for the timely arrival of the troops
of General A. P. Hill.His six brigades of Confederate veterans had been
the last to leave Harper's Ferry, remaining behind Jackson's main body in
order to attend to the details of the surrender.Just as the Federal Ninth
Corps was in the height of its advance, a cloud of dust on Harper's Ferry
road cheered the Confederates to redoubled effort.Out of the dust the
brigades of Hill debouched upon the field.Their fighting blood seemed to
have but mounted more strongly during their march of eighteen miles.Without waiting for orders, Hill threw his men into the fight and the
progress of the Ninth Corps was stopped.Lee had counted on the arrival of
Hill in time to prevent any successful attempt upon the Confederate right
held by Longstreet's Corps, two-thirds of which had been detached in the
thick of the fighting of the morning, when Lee's left and center suffered
so severely.Burnside's delay at the bridge could not have been more
fortunate for Lee if he had fixed its duration himself.Had the
Confederate left been attacked at the time appointed, the outcome of
Antietam could scarcely have been other than a decisive victory for the
Federals.Even at the time when Burnside's tardy advance began, it must
have prevailed against the weakened and wearied Confederates had not the
fresh troops of A. P. Hill averted the disaster.[Illustration: AFTER THE ADVANCE]

In the advance along the Sharpsburg road near the Sherrick house the 79th
New York "Highlanders" deployed as skirmishers.From orchards and
cornfields and from behind fences and haystacks the Confederate
sharpshooters opened upon them, but they swept on, driving in a part of
Jones' division and capturing a battery just before A. P. Hill's troops
arrived.With these reenforcements the Confederates drove back the brave
Highlanders from the suburbs of Sharpsburg, which they had reached.Stubborn Scotch blood would permit only a reluctant retreat.Sharp
fighting occurred around the Sherrick house with results seen in the lower
picture.[Illustration: THE SEVENTEENTH NEW YORK ARTILLERY DRILLING BEFORE THE

    As it is, the battle of Stone's River seems less clearly a Federal
    victory than the battle of Shiloh.The latter decided the fall of
    Corinth; the former did not decide the fall of Chattanooga.Offensively it was a drawn battle, as looked at from either side.As a
    defensive battle, however, it was clearly a Union victory.--_John
    Fiske in "The Mississippi Valley in the Civil War."_


The battle of Corinth developed a man--William S. Rosecrans--whose
singular skill in planning the battle, and whose dauntless courage in
riding between the firing-lines at the opportune moment, drew the
country's attention almost as fully as Grant had done at Fort Donelson.And at this particular moment the West needed, or thought it needed, a
man.The autumn months of 1862 had been spent by Generals Bragg and Buell
in an exciting race across Kentucky, each at the head of a great army.Buell had saved Louisville from the legions of Bragg, and he had driven
the Confederate Army of the Mississippi from the State; but he had not
prevented his opponent from carrying away a vast amount of plunder, nor
had he won decisive results at the battle of Perryville, which took place
October 8, 1862, four days after the battle of Corinth.Thereupon the
Federal authorities decided to relieve Buell of the Army of the Ohio and
to give it to General Rosecrans.On October 30, 1862, Rosecrans assumed command at Nashville of this force,
which was now designated as the Army of the Cumberland.Bragg had
concentrated his army at Murfreesboro, in central Tennessee, about thirty
miles southeast of Nashville and a mile east of a little tributary of the
Cumberland River called Stone's River.Here occurred, two months later,
the bloodiest single day's battle in the West, a conflict imminent as
soon as the news came (on December 26th) that the Federals were advancing
from Nashville.General Bragg did not lose a moment in marshaling his army into well-drawn
battle-lines.His army was in two corps with a cavalry division under
General Wheeler, Forrest and Morgan being on detached service.The left
wing, under General Hardee, and the center, under Polk, were sent across
Stone's River, the right wing, a division under John C. Breckinridge,
remaining on the eastern side of the stream to guard the town.The line
was three miles in length, and on December 30th the Federal host that had
come from Nashville stood opposite, in a parallel line.The left wing, opposite Breckinridge, was commanded by
Thomas L. Crittenden, whose brother was a commander in the Confederacy.They were sons of the famous United States senator from Kentucky, John J.
Crittenden.The Federal center, opposite Polk, was commanded by George H.
Thomas, and the right wing, opposing the Confederate left, was led by
Alexander McD.McCook, one of the well-known "Fighting McCook" brothers.The effective Federal force was about forty-three thousand men; the
Confederate army numbered about thirty-eight thousand.That night they
bivouacked within musket range of each other and the camp-fires of each
were clearly seen by the other as they shone through the cedar groves that
interposed.Thus lay the two great armies, ready to spring upon each other
in deadly combat with the coming of the morning.Rosecrans had permitted McCook to thin out his lines over too much space,
while on that very part of the field Bragg had concentrated his forces for
the heaviest attack.The plans of battle made by the two opposing
commanders were strikingly similar.Rosecrans' plan was to throw his left
wing, under Crittenden, across the river upon the Confederate right under
Breckinridge, to crush it in one impetuous dash, and to swing around
through Murfreesboro to the Franklin road and cut off the Confederate
line of retreat.Bragg, on the other hand, intended to make a similar dash
upon the Union right, pivot upon his center, press back McCook upon that
center, crumpling the Federals and seizing the Nashville turnpike to cut
off Rosecrans' retreat toward Nashville.Neither, of course, knew of the
other's plan, and much would depend on who would strike first.At the early light of the last day of the year the Confederate left wing
moved upon the Union right in a magnificent battle-line, three-quarters of
a mile in length and two columns deep.At the same time the Confederate
artillery opened with their cannon.McCook was astonished at so fierce and
sudden a charge.The gallant Patrick Cleburne, one of the ablest
commanders in the Southern armies, led his division, which had been
brought from the Confederate right, in the charge.The Federal lines were
ill prepared for this sudden onslaught, and before McCook could arrange
them several batteries were overpowered and eleven of the heavy guns were
in the hands of the Confederates.Slowly the Union troops fell back, firing as they went; but they had no
power to check the impetuous, overwhelming charge of the onrushing foe.McCook's two right divisions, under Johnson and Jeff.C. Davis, were
driven back, but his third division, which was commanded by a young
officer who had attracted unusual attention at the battle of
Perryville--Philip H. Sheridan--held its ground.At the first Confederate
advance, Sill's brigade of Sheridan's division drove the troops in front
of it back into their entrenchments, and in the charge the brave Sill lost
his life.While the battle raged with tremendous fury on the Union right, Rosecrans
was three miles away, throwing his left across the river.Hearing the
terrific roar of battle at the other end of the line, Rosecrans hastened
to begin his attack on Breckinridge hoping to draw a portion of the
Confederate force away from McCook.But as the hours of the forenoon
passed he was dismayed as he noted that the sound of battle was coming
nearer, and he rightly divined that his right wing was receding before the
dashing soldiers of the South.He ordered McCook to dispute every inch of
the ground; but McCook's command was soon torn to pieces and disorganized,
except the division of Sheridan.The latter stood firm against the overwhelming numbers, a stand that
attracted the attention of the country and brought him military fame.He
checked the onrushing Confederates at the point of the bayonet; he formed
a new line under fire.In his first position Sheridan held his ground for
two hours.The Confederate attack had also fallen heavily on Negley, who
was stationed on Sheridan's left, and on Palmer, both of Thomas' center.Rousseau commanding the reserves, and Van Cleve of Crittenden's forces
were ordered to the support of the Union center and right.Here, for two
hours longer the battle raged with unabated fury, and the slaughter of
brave men on both sides was appalling.Three times the whole Confederate
left and center were thrown against the Union divisions, but failed to
break the lines.At length when their cartridge boxes were empty
Sheridan's men could do nothing but retire for more ammunition, and they
did this in good order to a rolling plain near the Nashville road.But
Rousseau of Thomas' center was there to check the Confederate advance.It was now past noon, and still the battle roar resounded unceasingly
through the woods and hills about Murfreesboro.Though both hosts had
struggled and suffered since early morning, they still held to their guns,
pouring withering volleys into each other's ranks.The Federal right and
center had been forced back at right angles to the position they had held
when day dawned; and the Confederate left was swung around at right angles
to its position of the morning.The Federal left rested on Stone's River,
while Bragg's right was on the same stream and close to the line in blue.Meantime, Rosecrans had massed his artillery on a little hill overlooking
the field of action.He had also re-formed the broken lines of the right
and center and called in twelve thousand fresh troops.Then, after a brief
lull, the battle opened again and the ranks of both sides were torn with
grape and canister and bursting shells.In answer to Bragg's call for reenforcements came Breckinridge with all
but one brigade of his division, a host of about seven thousand fresh
troops.The new Confederate attack began slowly, but increased its speed
at every step.Suddenly, a thundering volley burst from the line in blue,
and the front ranks of the attacking column disappeared.Again, a volley
tore through the ranks in gray, and the assault was abandoned.The battle had raged for nearly eleven hours, when night enveloped the
scene, and the firing abated slowly and died away.It had been a bloody
day--this first day's fight at Stone's River--and except at Antietam it
had not thus far been surpassed in the war.The advantage was clearly with
the Confederates.They had pressed back the Federals for two miles, had
routed their right wing and captured many prisoners and twenty-eight heavy
guns.But Rosecrans determined to hold his ground and try again.The next day was New Year's and but for a stray fusillade, here and there,
both armies remained inactive, except that each quietly prepared to renew
the contest on the morrow.The renewal of the battle on January 2nd was
fully expected on both sides, but there was little fighting till four in
the afternoon.Rosecrans had sent General Van Cleve's division on January
1st across the river to seize an elevation from which he could shell the
town of Murfreesboro.Bragg now sent Breckinridge to dislodge the
division, and he did so with splendid effect.But Breckinridge's men came
into such a position as to be exposed to the raking fire of fifty-two
pieces of Federal artillery on the west side of the river.Returning the
deadly and constant fire as best they could, they stood the storm of shot
and shell for half an hour when they retreated to a place of safety,
leaving seventeen hundred of their number dead or wounded on the field.That night the two armies again lay within musket shot of each other.The
next day brought no further conflict and during that night General Bragg
moved away to winter quarters at Shelbyville, on the Elk River.Murfreesboro, or Stone's River, was one of the great battles of the war.The losses were about thirteen thousand to the Federals and over ten
thousand to the Confederates.Both sides claimed victory--the South
because of Bragg's signal success on the first day; the North because of
Breckinridge's fearful repulse at the final onset and of Bragg's
retreating in the night and refusing to fight again.A portion of the
Confederate army occupied Shelbyville, Tennessee, and the larger part
entrenched at Tullahoma, eighteen miles to the southeast.Six months after the battle of Stone's River, the Federal army suddenly
awoke from its somnolent condition--a winter and spring spent in raids and
unimportant skirmishes--and became very busy preparing for a long and
hasty march.Rosecrans' plan of campaign was brilliant and proved most
effective.He realized that Tullahoma was the barrier to Chattanooga, and
determined to drive the Confederates from it.On June 23, 1863, the advance began.The cavalry, under General Stanley,
had received orders to advance upon Shelbyville on the 24th, and during
that night to build immense and numerous camp-fires before the Confederate
stronghold at Shelbyville, to create the impression that Rosecrans' entire
army was massing at that point.But the wily leader of the Federals had
other plans, and when Stanley, supported by General Granger, had built his
fires, the larger force was closing in upon Tullahoma.The stratagem dawned upon Bragg too late to check Rosecrans' plans.Stanley and Granger made a brilliant capture of Shelbyville, and Bragg
retired to Tullahoma; but finding here that every disposition had been
made to fall upon his rear, he continued his southward retreat toward
Chattanooga.[Illustration: MEN WHO LEARNED WAR WITH SHERMAN

so that they could never be used again.The wrecking of a railroad might
postpone a maneuver for months, or might terminate a campaign suddenly in
defeat.Each side in retreat burned its bridges and destroyed the railroad
behind it.Again advancing, each had to pause for the weary work of
repair.[Illustration: SKIRMISHERS AT CHANCELLORSVILLE._Painted by J. W. Gies._

FREDERICKSBURG--DISASTER FOR A NEW UNION LEADER

    The Army of the Potomac had fought gallantly; it had not lost a single
    cannon, all its attacks being made by masses of infantry; it had
    experienced neither disorder nor rout.But the defeat was complete,
    and its effects were felt throughout the entire country as keenly as
    in the ranks of the army.The little confidence that Burnside had been
    able to inspire in his soldiers had vanished, and the respect which
    everybody entertained for the noble character of the unfortunate
    general could not supply its place.--_Comte de Paris, in "History of
    the Civil War in America."_


The silent city of military graves at Fredericksburg is a memorial of one
of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War.The battle of Antietam had been
regarded a victory by the Federals and a source of hope to the North,
after a wearisome period of inaction and defeats.General George B.
McClellan, in command of the Army of the Potomac, failed to follow up this
advantage and strike fast and hard while the Southern army was shattered
and weak.President Lincoln's impatience was brought to a climax;
McClellan was relieved and succeeded by General Ambrose E. Burnside, who
was looked upon with favor by the President, and who had twice declined
this proffered honor.It was on November 5, 1862, nearly two months after
Antietam, when this order was issued.The Army of the Potomac was in
splendid form and had made plans for a vigorous campaign.On the 9th
Burnside assumed command, and on the following day McClellan took leave of
his beloved troops.Burnside at once changed the whole plan of campaign, and decided to move
on Fredericksburg, which lay between the Union and Confederate armies.He
organized his army into three grand divisions, under Generals Sumner,
Hooker, and Franklin, commanding the right, center, and left, and moved
his troops from Warrenton to Falmouth.A delay of some two weeks was due
to the failure of arrival of the pontoons.In a council of war held on the
night of December 10th the officers under Burnside expressed themselves
almost unanimously as opposed to the plan of battle, but Burnside
disregarded their views and determined to carry out his original plans
immediately.After some delay and desultory fighting for two days, the
crossing of the army was effected by the morning of December 13th.By this
time General Robert E. Lee, commanding the Confederates, had his army
concentrated and entrenched on the hills surrounding the town.In their
efforts to place their bridges the Federals were seriously hindered by the
firing of the Confederate sharpshooters--"hornets that were stinging the
Army of the Potomac into a frenzy."The Confederate fire continued until
silenced by a heavy bombardment of the city from the Federal guns, when
the crossing of the army into Fredericksburg was completed without further
interference.The forces of Lee were in battle array about the town.Their line
stretched for five miles along the range of hills which spread in crescent
shape around the lowland where the city lay, surrounding it on all sides
save the east, where the river flowed.The strongest Confederate position
was on the <DW72>s of the lowest hill of the range, Marye's Heights, which
rose in the rear of the town.Along the foot of this hill there was a
stone wall, about four feet in height, bounding the eastern side of the
Telegraph road, which at this point runs north and south, being depressed
a few feet below the surface of the stone wall, thus forming a breastwork
for the Confederate troops.Behind it a strong force was concealed, while
higher up, in several ranks, the main army was massed, stretching along
the line of hills.The right wing, consisting of thirty thousand troops on
an elevation near Hamilton's Crossing of the Fredericksburg and Potomac
Railroad, was commanded by "Stonewall" Jackson.The left, on Marye's
Heights and Marye's Hill, was commanded by the redoubtable Longstreet.The
Southern forces numbered about seventy-eight thousand.Into the little city below and the adjoining valleys, the Federal troops
had been marching for two days.Franklin's Left Grand Division of forty
thousand was strengthened by two divisions from Hooker's Center Grand
Division, and was ordered to make the first attack on the Confederate
right under Jackson.Sumner's Right Grand Division, also reenforced from
Hooker's forces, was formed for assault against the Confederate's
strongest point at Marye's Hill.All this magnificent and portentous battle formation had been effected
under cover of a dense fog, and when it lifted on that fateful Saturday
there was revealed a scene of truly military grandeur.Concealed by the
somber curtain of nature the Southern hosts had fixed their batteries and
entrenched themselves most advantageously upon the hills, and the Union
legions, massed in menacing strength below, now lay within easy
cannon-shot of their foe.The Union army totaled one hundred and thirteen
thousand men.After skirmishing and gathering of strength, it was at
length ready for the final spring and the death-grapple.When the sun's rays broke through the fog during the forenoon of December
13th, Franklin's Grand Division was revealed in full strength in front of
the Confederate right, marching and countermarching in preparation for the
coming conflict.Officers in new, bright uniforms, thousands of bayonets
gleaming in the sunshine, champing steeds, rattling gun-carriages whisking
artillery into proper range of the foe, infantry, cavalry, batteries, with
officers and men, formed a scene of magnificent grandeur which excited the
admiration even of the Confederates.This maneuver has been called the
grandest military scene of the war.Yet with all this brave show, we have seen that Burnside's subordinate
officers were unanimous in their belief in the rashness of the
undertaking.The English military writer,
Colonel Henderson, has explained why this was so:

    And yet that vast array, so formidable of aspect, lacked that moral
    force without which physical power, even in its most terrible form, is
    but an idle show.Not only were the strength of the Confederate
    position, the want of energy of preliminary movements, the insecurity
    of their own situation, but too apparent to the intelligence of the
    regimental officers and men, but they mistrusted their commander.Northern writers have recorded that the Army of the Potomac never went
    down to battle with less alacrity than on this day at Fredericksburg.The first advance began at 8:30 in the morning, while the fog was still
dense, upon Jackson's right.Reynolds ordered Meade with a division,
supported by two other divisions under Doubleday and Gibbon, to attack
Jackson at his weakest point, the extreme right of the Confederate lines,
and endeavor to seize one of the opposing heights.The advance was made in
three lines of battle, which were guarded in front and on each flank by
artillery which swept the field in front as the army advanced.The
Confederates were placed to have an enfilading sweep from both flanks
along the entire front line of march.When Reynolds' divisions had
approached within range, Jackson's small arms on the left poured in a
deadly fire, mowing down the brave men in the Union lines in swaths,
leaving broad gaps where men had stood.This fire was repeated again and again, as the Federals pressed on, only
to be repulsed.Once only was the Confederate line broken, when Meade
carried the crest, capturing flags and prisoners.The ground lost by the
Confederates was soon recovered, and the Federals were forced to retire.Some of the charges made by the Federals during this engagement were
heroic in the extreme, only equaled by the opposition met from the foe.In one advance, knapsacks were unslung and bayonets fixed; a brigade
marched across a plowed field, and passed through broken lines of other
brigades, which were retiring to the rear in confusion from the leaden
storm.The fire became incessant and destructive; many fell, killed or wounded;
the front line slackened its pace, and without orders commenced firing.A
halt seemed imminent, and a halt in the face of the terrific fire to which
the men were exposed meant death; but, urged on by regimental commanders
in person, the charge was renewed, when with a shout they leaped the
ditches, charged across the railroad, and upon the foe, killing many with
the bayonet and capturing several hundred prisoners.But this was only a
temporary gain.In every instance the Federals were shattered and driven
back.Men were lying dead in heaps, the wounded and dying were groaning in
agony.Soldiers were fleeing; officers were galloping to and fro urging
their lines forward, and begging their superior officers for assistance
and reenforcement.A dispatch to Burnside from Franklin, dated 2:45, was as follows: "My left
has been very badly handled; what hope is there of getting reenforcements
across the river?"Another dispatch, dated 3:45, read: "Our troops have
gained no ground in the last half hour."In their retreat the fire was almost as destructive as during the assault.Most of the wounded were brought from the field after this engagement, but
the dead were left where they fell.It was during this engagement that
General George D. Bayard was mortally wounded by a shot which had severed
the sword belt of Captain Gibson, leaving him uninjured.The knapsack of a
soldier who was in a stooping posture was struck by a ball, and a deck of
cards was sent flying twenty feet in the air.Those witnessing the
ludicrous scene called to him, "Oh, deal me a hand!"thus indicating the
spirit of levity among soldiers even amid such surroundings.Another
soldier sitting on the ground suddenly leaped high above the heads of his
comrades as a shell struck the spot, scooping a wheelbarrowful of earth,
but the man was untouched.Entirely independent of the action in which the Left Grand Division under
Franklin was engaged against the right wing of the Confederate line,
Sumner's Right Grand Division was engaged in a terrific assault upon the
works on Marye's Heights, the stronghold of the Confederate forces.Their
position was almost impregnable, consisting of earthworks, wood, and stone
barricades running along the sunken road near the foot of Marye's Hill.The Federals were not aware of the sunken road, nor of the force of
twenty-five hundred under General Cobb concealed behind the stone wall,
this wall not being new work as a part of the entrenchments, but of
earlier construction.When the advance up the road was made they were
harassed by shot and shell and rifle-balls at every step, but the men came
dashing into line undismayed by the terrific fire which poured down upon
them.The Irish Brigade, the second of Hancock's division, under General
Meagher, made a wonderful charge.When they returned from the assault but
two hundred and fifty out of twelve hundred men reported under arms from
the field, and all these were needed to care for their wounded comrades.The One Hundred and Sixteenth Pennsylvania regiment was new on the field
of battle, but did fearless and heroic service.The approach was
completely commanded by the Confederate guns.Repeatedly the advance was
repulsed by well-directed fire from the batteries.Once again Sumner's gallant men charged across a railroad cut, running
down one side and up the other, and still again attempted to escape in the
same manner, but each time they were forced to retire precipitately by a
murderous fire from the Confederate batteries.Not only was the
Confederate fire disastrous upon the approach and the successive repulses
by the foe, but it also inflicted great damage upon the masses of the
Federal army in front of Marye's Hill.The Confederates' effective and
successful work on Marye's Hill in this battle was not alone due to the
natural strength of their position, but also to the skill and generalship
of the leaders, and to the gallantry, courage, and well-directed aim of
their cannoneers and infantry.Six times the heroic Union troops dashed against the invulnerable
position, each time to be repulsed with terrific loss.General Couch, who
had command of the Second Corps, viewing the scene of battle from the
steeple of the court-house with General Howard, says: "The whole plain was
covered with men, prostrate and dropping, the live men running here and
there, and in front closing upon each other, and the wounded coming back.I had never before seen fighting like that, nothing approaching it in
terrible uproar and destruction."General Howard reports that Couch exclaimed: "Oh, great God!see how our
men, our poor fellows, are falling!"At half-past one Couch signaled
Burnside: "I am losing.The point and method of attack made by Sumner was anticipated by the
Confederates, careful preparation having been made to meet it.The fire
from the Confederate batteries harassed the Union lines, and as they
advanced steadily, heroically, without hurrah or battle-cry, the ranks
were cut to pieces by canister and shell and musket-balls.Heavy artillery
fire was poured into the Union ranks from front, right, and left with
frightful results.Quickly filling up the decimated ranks they approached
the stone wall masking the death-trap where General Cobb lay with a strong
force awaiting the approach.Torrents of lead poured into the bodies of
the defenseless men, slaying, crushing, destroying the proud army of a few
hours before.As though in pity, a cloud of smoke momentarily shut out the
wretched scene but brought no balm to the helpless victims of this awful
carnage.The ground was so thickly strewn with dead bodies as seriously to
impede the movements of a renewed attack.These repeated assaults in such
good order caused some apprehension on the part of General Lee, who said
to Longstreet after the third attack, "General, they are massing very
heavily and will break your line, I am afraid."But the great general's
fears proved groundless.General Cobb was borne from the field mortally wounded, and Kershaw took
his place in the desperate struggle.The storm of shot and shell which met
the assaults was terrific.Men fell almost in battalions; the dead and
wounded lay in heaps.Late in the day the dead bodies, which had become
frozen from the extreme cold, were stood up in front of the soldiers as a
protection against the awful fire to shield the living, and at night were
set up as dummy sentinels.The steadiness of the Union troops, and the silent, determined heroism of
the rank and file in these repeated, but hopeless, assaults upon the
Confederate works, were marvelous, and amazed even their officers.The
real greatness in a battle is the fearless courage, the brave and heroic
conduct, of the men under withering fire.It was the enlisted men who were
the glory of the army.It was they, the rank and file, who stood in the
front, closed the gaps, and were mowed down in swaths like grass by cannon
and musket-balls.After the sixth disastrous attempt to carry the works of the Confederate
left it was night; the Federal army was repulsed and had retired; hope was
abandoned, and it was seen that the day was lost to the Union side.Then
the shattered Army of the Potomac sought to gather the stragglers and care
for the wounded.Fredericksburg, the beautiful Virginia town, was a
pitiable scene in contrast to its appearance a few days before.Ancestral
homes were turned into barracks and hospitals.The charming drives and
stately groves, the wonted pleasure grounds of Colonial dames and Southern
cavaliers, were not filled with grand carriages and gay parties, but with
war horses, soldiers, and military accouterments.Aside from desultory
firing by squads and skirmishers at intervals there was no renewal of the
conflict.The bloody carnage was over, the plan of Burnside had ended in failure,
and thousands of patriotic and brave men, blindly obedient to their
country's command, were the toll exacted from the Union army.Burnside,
wild with anguish at what he had done, walking the floor of his tent,
exclaimed, "Oh, those men--those men over there," pointing to the
battlefield, "I am thinking of them all the time."In his report of the
battle to Washington, Burnside gave reasons for the issue, and in a manly
way took the responsibility upon himself, and most highly commended his
officers and men.He said, "For the failure in the attack I am
responsible, as the extreme gallantry, courage, and endurance shown by
them [officers and men] were never excelled."President Lincoln's verdict in regard to this battle is adverse to the
almost unanimous opinion of the historians.In his reply, December 22d, to
General Burnside's report of the battle, he says, "Although you were not
successful, the attempt was not an error, nor the failure other than an
accident."Burnside, at his own request, was relieved of the command of
the Army of the Potomac, however, on January 25, 1863, and was succeeded
by General Hooker.The Union loss in killed, wounded, and missing was
12,653, and the Confederates lost 5,377.After the battle the wounded lay on the field in their agony exposed to
the freezing cold for forty-eight hours before arrangements were effected
to care for them.Many were burned to death by the long, dead grass
becoming ignited by cannon fire.The scene witnessed by the army of those
screaming, agonizing, dying comrades was dreadful and heart-rending.Burnside's plan had been to renew the battle, but the overwhelming opinion
of the other officers prevailed.The order was withdrawn and the defeated
Union army slipped away under the cover of darkness on December 15th, and
encamped in safety across the river.The battle of Fredericksburg had
passed into history.[Illustration: THE SECOND LEADER AGAINST RICHMOND

COPYRIGHT 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Major-General Ambrose Everett Burnside was a West Point graduate, inventor
of a breech-loading rifle, commander of a brigade in the first battle of
Bull Run, captor of Roanoke Island and Newberne (North Carolina), and
commander of the Federal left at Antietam.He was appointed to the command
of the Army of the Potomac and succeeded General George B. McClellan on
November 8, 1862.He was a brave soldier, but was an impatient leader and
inclined to be somewhat reckless.He pressed rapidly his advance against
Lee and massed his entire army along Stafford Heights, on the east bank of
the Rappahannock, opposite Fredericksburg.According to General W. B.
Franklin (who commanded the left grand division of the army), the notion
that a serious battle was necessary to Federal control of the town "was
not entertained by any one."General Sumner (who led the advance of
Burnside's army) held this opinion but he had not received orders to cross
the river.Crossing was delayed nearly a month and this delay resulted in
the Federal disaster on December 13th.This put an abrupt end to active
operations by Burnside against Lee.This picture was taken at Warrenton,
November 24th, on the eve of the departure of the army for its march to
Fredericksburg.[Illustration: THE DETAINED GUNS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.In the foreground, looking from what is
approximately the same position as the opening picture, are three guns of
Tyler's Connecticut battery.It was from all along this ridge that the
town had suffered its bombardment in December of the previous year.Again
the armies were separated by the Rappahannock River.There was a new
commander at the head of the Army of the Potomac--General Hooker.The
plundered and deserted town now held by the Confederates was to be made
the objective of another attack.The heights beyond were once more to be
assaulted; bridges were to be rebuilt.This ground
of much contention was deserted some time before Lee advanced to his
invasion of Pennsylvania.Very slowly the inhabitants of Fredericksburg
had returned to their ruined homes.The town was a vast Federal cemetery,
the dead being buried in gardens and backyards, for during its occupancy
almost every dwelling had been turned into a temporary hospital.After the
close of the war these bodies were gathered and a National Cemetery was
established on Willis' Hill, on Marye's Heights, the point successfully
defended by Lee's veterans.Heavy pontoon-boats, each on its separate wagon, were sometimes as
necessary as food or ammunition.At every important crossing of the many
rivers that had to be passed in the Peninsula Campaign the bridges had
been destroyed.There were few places where these streams were fordable.Pontoons, therefore, made a most important adjunct to the Army of the
Potomac.[Illustration: PONTOON-BOATS IN TRANSIT]

scene.On those memorable days of December 11 and 12, 1862, from these
very trenches shown in the foreground, the ragged gray riflemen saw on
that hillside across the river the blue of the uniforms of the massed
Federal troops.The lines of tents made great white spaces, but the ground
could hardly be seen for the host of men who were waiting, alas!to die by
thousands on this coveted shore.From these hills, too, burst an incessant
flaming and roaring cannon fire.Siege-guns and field artillery poured
shot and shell into the town of Fredericksburg.Every house became a
target, though deserted except for a few hardy and venturesome riflemen.Ruined and battered and
bloody, Fredericksburg three times was a Federal hospital, and its
backyards became little cemeteries.[Illustration: A TARGET AT FREDERICKSBURG FOR THE FEDERAL GUNS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: THE BRIDGES THAT A BAND OF MUSIC THREATENED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]At Franklin Crossing, on the Rappahannock, occurred an incident that
proves how little things may change the whole trend of the best-laid
plans.The left Union wing under the command of General Franklin, composed
of the First Army Corps under General Reynolds, and the Sixth under
General W. F. Smith, was crossing to engage in the battle of
Fredericksburg.For two days they poured across these yielding planks
between the swaying boats to the farther shore.Now, in the crossing of
bridges, moving bodies of men must break step or even well-built
structures might be threatened.The colonel of one of the regiments in
General Devens' division that led the van ordered his field music to
strike up just as the head of the column swept on to the flimsy planking;
before the regiment was half-way across, unconsciously the men had fallen
into step and the whole fabric was swaying to the cadenced feet.Vibrating
like a great fiddle-string, the bridge would have sunk and parted, but a
keen eye had seen the danger.was the order, and a
staff officer spurred his horse through the men, shouting at top voice.The lone charge was made through the marching column: some jumped into the
pontoons to avoid the hoofs; a few went overboard; but the head of the
column was reached at last, and the music stopped.A greater blunder than
this, however, took place on the plains beyond.Owing to a
misunderstanding of orders, 37,000 troops were never brought into action;
17,000 men on their front bore the brunt of a long day's fighting.[Illustration: OFFICERS OF THE FAMOUS "IRISH BRIGADE"

Sixty-third, Sixty-ninth and Eighty-eighth New York and the One Hundred
and Sixteenth Pennsylvania) was commanded by General Thomas F. Meagher and
advanced in Hancock's Division to the first assault at Marye's Heights, on
December 13, 1862.In this charge the Irish soldiers moved steadily up the
ridge until within a few yards of a sunken road, from which unexpected
fire mowed them down.Of the 1,315 men which Meagher led into battle, 545
fell in that charge.The officer standing is Colonel Patrick Kelly, of the
Eighty-eighth New York, who was one of the valiant heroes of this charge,
and succeeded to the command of the Irish Brigade after General Meagher.The officer seated is Captain Clooney, of the
same regiment, who was killed at Antietam.Sitting next to him is Father
Dillon, Chaplain of the Sixty-third New York, and to the right Father
Corby, Chaplain of the Eighty-eighth New York; the latter gave absolution
to Caldwell's Division, of Hancock's Corps, under a very heavy fire at
Gettysburg.By the side of Colonel Kelly stands a visiting priest.The
identification of this group has been furnished by Captain W. L. D.
O'Grady, of the Eighty-eighth New York.[Illustration: THE SUMMIT OF SLAUGHTER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Marye's House marked the center of the Confederate position on the
Heights, before which the Federals fell three deep in one of the bravest
and bloodiest assaults of the war.The eastern boundary of the Marye
estate was a retaining wall, along which ran a sunken road; on the other
side of this was a stone wall, shoulder high, forming a perfect infantry
parapet.Here two brigades of Confederates were posted and on the crest
above them were the supporting batteries, while the <DW72> between was
honeycombed with the rifle-pits of the sharpshooters, one of which is seen
in the picture.Six times did the Federals, raked by the deadly fire of
the Washington Artillery, advance to within a hundred yards of the sunken
road, only to be driven back by the rapid volleys of the Confederate
infantry concealed there.Less than three of every five men in Hancock's
division came back from their charge on these death-dealing heights.The
complete repulse of the day and the terrific slaughter were the barren
results of an heroic effort to obey orders.[Illustration: THE FATEFUL CROSSING

Potomac on December 11, 1862.Little did he dream that his men of the
Second Corps were to bear the brunt of the fighting and the most crushing
blow of the defeat on the 13th.Soon after three o'clock on the morning of
the 11th the columns moved out with alacrity to the river bank and before
daybreak, hidden at first by the fog, the pontoniers began building the
bridges.Confederate sharpshooters drove off the working party from the
bridge below the Lacy House and also from the middle bridge farther down.As the mist cleared, volunteers ferried themselves over in the boats and
drove off the riflemen.At last, at daybreak of the 12th, the town of
Fredericksburg was occupied, but the whole of another foggy day was
consumed in getting the army concentrated on the western shore.Nineteen
batteries (one hundred and four guns) accompanied Sumner's troops, but all
save seven of these were ordered back or left in the streets of
Fredericksburg.Late on the morning of the 13th the confused and belated
orders began to arrive from Burnside's headquarters across the river; one
was for Sumner to assault the Confederate batteries on Marye's Heights.At
nightfall Sumner's men retired into Fredericksburg, leaving 4,800 dead or
wounded on the field."Oh, those men, those men over there!I cannot get
them out of my mind!"wailed Burnside in an agony of failure.Yet he was
planning almost in the same breath to lead in person his old command, the
Ninth Corps, in another futile charge in the morning.On the night of the
14th, better judgment prevailed and the order came to retire across the
Rappahannock.[Illustration: NEW LEADERS AND NEW PLANS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.These were the men whose work it was,
during the winter after Fredericksburg, to restore the _esprit de corps_
of the Army of the Potomac.The tireless energy and magnetic personality
of Hooker soon won officers from their disaffection and put an end to
desertions--which had been going on at the rate of two hundred per day
before he took command.By spring everything seemed propitious for an
aggressive campaign, the plans for which were brilliantly drawn and at
first vigorously carried out, giving truth to Lincoln's expressed belief
that Hooker was "a trained and skilful soldier."In that remarkable letter
of admonition to Hooker upon assuming command, Lincoln added: "But beware
of rashness, beware of rashness; with energy and with sleepless vigilance
go forward and give us victories."By some strange fate it was not
rashness but quite the contrary which compassed the failure of "Fighting
Joe" Hooker at Chancellorsville.His first forward advance was executed
with his usual bold initiative.Before Lee could fully divine his purpose,
Hooker with thirty-six thousand men was across his left flank in a
favorable position, with the main body of his army at hand ready to give
battle.Then came Hooker's inexplicable order to fall back upon
Chancellorsville.That very night, consulting in the abandoned Federal
position, Lee and Jackson formed the plan which drove Hooker back across
the Rappahannock in ignominious defeat.CHANCELLORSVILLE AND JACKSON'S FLANKING MARCH


After the Fredericksburg campaign the Union forces encamped at Falmouth
for the winter, while Lee remained with the Southern army on the site of
his successful contest at Fredericksburg.Thus the two armies lay facing
each other within hailing distance, across the historic river, waiting for
the coming of spring.Major-General Joseph Hooker, popularly known as
"Fighting Joe" Hooker, who had succeeded Burnside in command of the Army
of the Potomac, soon had the troops on a splendid campaign footing.His
force was between 125,000 and 130,000 men; Lee's, about 60,000.Hooker conceived a plan of campaign which was ingenious and masterful, and
had he carried it out there would have been a different story to tell
about Chancellorsville.The plan was to deploy a portion of the army to
serve as a decoy to Lee, while the remainder of the host at the same time
occupied the vicinity of Chancellorsville, a country mansion, in the
center of the wilderness that stretched along the Rappahannock.Lee was a great general and a master in strategy.He had learned of
Hooker's plan and, paying but little attention to Sedgwick east of
Fredericksburg, had turned to face Hooker.By a rapid night march he met
the Union army before it had reached its destination.He was pushed back,
however, by Sykes, of Meade's corps, who occupied the position assigned to
him.Meade was on the left, and Slocum on the right, with adequate support
in the rear.All was in readiness and most favorable for the "certain
destruction" of the Confederates predicted by "Fighting Joe" when, to the
amazement and consternation of all his officers, Hooker ordered the whole
army to retire to the position it had occupied the day before, leaving the
advantage to his opponents.Lee quickly moved his army into the position thus relinquished, and began
feeling the Federal lines with skirmishers and some cannonading during the
evening of May 1st.By the next morning the two armies were in line of
battle.The danger in which the Confederate army now found itself was extreme.One
large Federal army was on its front, while another was at its rear, below
Fredericksburg.But Lee threw the hopes of success into one great and
decisive blow at Hooker's host.Dividing an army in the face of the foe is
extremely dangerous and contrary to all accepted theories of military
strategy; but there comes a time when such a course proves the salvation
of the legions in peril.Such was the case at Chancellorsville on May 2,
1863.the cannonading began its death-song and was soon followed by
infantry demonstrations, but without serious results.Early in the afternoon, Hooker by a ruse was beguiled into the
belief that Lee's army was in full retreat.What Hooker had seen and
believed to be a retreat was the marching of Jackson's forces, about
twenty-six thousand strong, from the battlefield.What he did not see,
however, was that, after a few miles, Jackson turned abruptly and made for
the right flank of the Federal host, the Eleventh Corps, under Howard.It
was after half-past five when Jackson broke from the woods into which he
had marched in a paralyzing charge upon the unprepared troops of Howard.The approach of this Confederate force was first intimated to the Federals
by the bending of shrubbery, the stampede of rabbits and squirrels, and
the flocks of birds in wild flight, as before a storm.Then appeared a few
skirmishers, then a musket volley, and then the storm broke in all its
fury--the war scream, the rattling musketry, the incessant roar of cannon.The knowledge that "Old Jack" was on
the field was inspiration enough for them.The charge was so precipitous,
so unexpected and terrific that it was impossible for the Federals to hold
their lines and stand against the impact of that awful onslaught which
carried everything before it.The regiments in Jackson's path, resisting
his advance, were cut to pieces and swept along as by a tidal wave, rolled
up like a scroll, multitudes of men, horses, mules, and cattle being piled
in an inextricable mass.Characteristic of Jackson's brilliant and
unexpected movements, it was like an electric flash, knocking the Eleventh
Corps into impotence, as Jackson expected it would.This crowning and
final stroke of Jackson's military genius was not impromptu, but the
result of his own carefully worked-out plan, which had been approved by
Lee.General Hooker was spending the late afternoon hours in his headquarters
at the Chancellor house.To the eastward there was considerable firing,
where his men were carrying out the plan of striking Lee in flank.Jackson
was retreating, of that he was sure, and Sickles, with Pleasanton's
cavalry and other reenforcements, was in pursuit.About half-past six the sounds of battle grew suddenly louder
and seemed to come from another direction.A staff-officer went to the
front of the house and turned his field-glass toward the west.At the startled cry Hooker sprang upon his horse and dashed down the road.He encountered portions of the Eleventh Corps pouring out of the forest--a
badly mixed crowd of men, wagons, and ambulances.They brought the news
that the right wing was overwhelmed.Hurriedly Hooker sought his old
command, Berry's division of the Third Corps, stationed in support of the
Eleventh.An officer who witnessed the scene says the division advanced with a firm
and steady step, cleaving the multitude of disbanded Federals as the bow
of a vessel cleaves the waves of the sea.It struck the advance of the
Confederates obliquely and checked it, with the aid of the Twelfth Corps
artillery.A dramatic, though tragic, feature of the rout was the charge of the
Eighth Pennsylvania cavalry, under Major Keenan, in the face of almost
certain death, to save the artillery of the Third Corps from capture.The
guns rested upon low ground and within reach of the Confederates.The
Federals had an equal opportunity to seize the artillery, but required a
few minutes to prepare themselves for action.The Confederate advance must
be checked for these few moments, and for this purpose Keenan gallantly
led his five hundred cavalrymen into the woods, while his comrades brought
the guns to bear upon the columns in gray.He gained the necessary time,
but lost his life at the head of his regiment, together with Captain
Arrowsmith and Adjutant Haddock, who fell by his side.The light of day had faded from the gruesome scene.The mighty turmoil was
silenced as darkness gathered, but the day's carnage was not ended.No
camp-fires were lighted in the woods or on the plain.The two hostile
forces were concealed in the darkness, watching through the shadows,
waiting for--they knew not what.Finally at midnight the order "Forward"
was repeated in subdued tones along the lines of Sickles' corps.Out over
the open and into the deep, dark thicket the men in blue pursued their
stealthy advance upon the Confederate position.Then the tragedies of the
night were like that of the day, and the moon shed her peaceful rays down
upon those shadowy figures as they struggled forward through the woods, in
the ravines, over the hillocks.The Federals, at heavy loss, gained the
position, and the engagement assumed the importance of a victory.It was on this day that death robbed the South of one of her most beloved
warriors.After darkness had overspread the land, Jackson, accompanied by
members of his staff, undertook a reconnaissance of the Federal lines.He came upon a line of Union infantry lying
on its arms and was forced to turn back along the plank road, on both
sides of which he had stationed his own men with orders to fire upon any
body of men approaching from the direction of the Federal battle-lines.The little cavalcade of Confederate officers galloped along the highway,
directly toward the ambuscade, and apparently forgetful of the strict
orders left with the skirmishers.A sudden flash of flame lighted the
scene for an instant, and within that space of time the Confederacy was
deprived of one of its greatest captains.Jackson was severely wounded,
and by his own men and through his own orders.When the news spread
through Jackson's corps and through the Confederate army the grief of the
Southern soldiers was heartbreaking to witness.The sorrow spread even
into the ranks of the Federal army, which, while opposed to the wounded
general on many hard-fought battle-grounds, had learned to respect and
admire "Stonewall" Jackson.The loss of Jackson to the South was incalculable.Lee had pronounced him
the right arm of the whole army.Next to Lee, Jackson was considered the
ablest general in the Confederate army.His shrewdness of judgment, his
skill in strategy, his lightning-like strokes, marked him as a unique and
brilliant leader.Devoutly religious, gentle and noble in character, the
nation that was not to be disunited lost a great citizen, as the
Confederate army lost a great captain, when a few days later General
Jackson died.That night orders passed from the Federal headquarters to Sedgwick, below
Fredericksburg, eleven miles away.Between him and Hooker stood the
Confederate army, flushed with its victories of the day.Immediately in
his front was Fredericksburg, with a strong guard of Southern warriors.Beyond loomed Marye's Heights, the battle-ground on which Burnside had in
the preceding winter left so many of his brave men in the vain endeavor to
drive the Confederate defenders from the crest.The courageous Sedgwick, notwithstanding the formidable obstacles that lay
on the road to Chancellorsville, responded immediately to Hooker's order.He was already on the south side of the river, but he was farther away
than Hooker supposed.Shortly after midnight he began a march that was
fraught with peril and death.Strong resistance was offered the advancing
blue columns as they came to the threshold of Fredericksburg, but they
swept on and over the defenders, and at dawn were at the base of the
heights.On the crest waved the standards of the Confederate Washington
Artillery.At the foot of the <DW72> was the stone wall before which the
Federals had fought and died but a few months before, in the battle of
Fredericksburg.Reenforcements were arriving in the Confederate trenches
constantly.The crest and <DW72>s bristled with cannon and muskets.The
pathways around the heights were barricaded.The route to the front seemed
blocked; still, the cry for help from Hooker was resounding in the ears of
Sedgwick.Gathering his troops, he attacked directly upon the stone wall and on up
the hillside, in the face of a terrific storm of artillery and musketry.The first assault failed; a flank movement met with no better success; and
the morning was nearly gone when the Confederates finally gave way at the
point of the bayonet before the irresistible onset of men in blue.The way
to Chancellorsville was open; but the cost to the Federals was appalling.Hundreds of the soldiers in blue lay wrapped in death upon the bloody
<DW72>s of Marye's Heights.It was the middle of the afternoon, and not at daybreak, as Hooker had
directed, when Sedgwick appeared in the rear of Lee's legions.A strong
force of Confederates under Early prevented his further advance toward a
juncture with Hooker's army at Chancellorsville.Since five o'clock in
the morning the battle had been raging at the latter place, and Jackson's
men, now commanded by Stuart, though being mowed down in great numbers,
vigorously pressed the attack of the day while crying out to one another
"Remember Jackson," as they thought of their wounded leader.While this engagement was at its height General Hooker, leaning against a
pillar of the Chancellor house, was felled to the ground, and for a moment
it was thought he was killed.The pillar had been shattered by a
cannon-ball.Hooker soon revived under the doctor's care and with great
force of will he mounted his horse and showed himself to his anxious
troops.He then withdrew his army to a stronger position, well guarded
with artillery.The Confederates did not attempt to assail it.The third
day's struggle at Chancellorsville was finished by noon, except in Lee's
rear, where Sedgwick fought all day, without success, to reach the main
body of Hooker's army.The Federals suffered very serious losses during
this day's contest.Even then it was believed that the advantage rested
with the larger Army of the Potomac and that the Federals had an
opportunity to win.Thirty-seven thousand Union troops, the First, and
three-quarters of the Fifth Corps, had been entirely out of the fight on
that day.Five thousand men of the Eleventh Corps, who were eager to
retrieve their misfortune, were also inactive.When night came, and the shades of darkness hid the sights of suffering on
the battlefield, the Federal army was resting in a huge curve, the left
wing on the Rappahannock and the right on the Rapidan.In this way the
fords across the rivers which led to safety were in control of the Army of
the Potomac.Lee moved his corps close to the bivouacs of the army in
blue.But, behind the Confederate battle-line, there was a new factor in
the struggle in the person of Sedgwick, with the remnants of his gallant
corps, which had numbered nearly twenty-two thousand when they started for
the front, but now were depleted by their terrific charge upon Marye's
Heights and the subsequent hard and desperate struggle with Early in the
afternoon.Lee was between two fires--Hooker in front and Sedgwick in the rear, both
of whose forces were too strong to be attacked simultaneously.Again the
daring leader of the Confederate legions did the unexpected, and divided
his army in the presence of the foe, though he was without the aid of his
great lieutenant, "Stonewall" Jackson.During the night Lee made his preparations, and when dawn appeared in the
eastern skies the movement began.Sedgwick, weak and battered by his
contact with Early on the preceding afternoon, resisted bravely, but to no
avail, and the Confederates closed in upon him on three sides, leaving the
way to Banks's Ford on the Rappahannock open to escape.Slowly the
Federals retreated and, as night descended, rested upon the river bank.After dark the return to the northern side was begun by Sedgwick's men,
and the Chancellorsville campaign was practically ended.The long, deep trenches full of Federal and Confederate dead told the
awful story of Chancellorsville.If we gaze into these trenches, which by
human impulse we are led to do, after the roar and din of the carnage is
still, the scene greeting the eye will never be forgotten.Side by side,
the heroes in torn and bloody uniforms, their only shrouds, were gently
laid.The Union loss in killed and wounded was a little over seventeen thousand,
and it cost the South thirteen thousand men to gain this victory on the
banks of the Rappahannock.The loss to both armies in officers was very
heavy.The two armies were weary and more than decimated.It appeared that both
were glad at the prospect of a cessation of hostilities.On the night of
May 5th, in a severe storm, Hooker conveyed his corps safely across the
river and settled the men again in their cantonments of the preceding
winter at Falmouth.The Confederates returned to their old encampment at
Fredericksburg.[Illustration: A MAN OF WHOM MUCH WAS EXPECTED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]A daring and experienced veteran of the Mexican
War, Hooker had risen in the Civil War from brigade commander to be the
commander of a grand division of the Army of the Potomac, and had never
been found wanting.His advancement to the head of the Army of the
Potomac, on January 26, 1863, was a tragic episode in his own career and
in that of the Federal arms.Gloom hung heavy over the North after
Fredericksburg.Upon Hooker fell the difficult task of redeeming the
unfulfilled political pledges for a speedy lifting of that gloom.It was
his fortune only to deepen it.[Illustration: "STONEWALL" JACKSON--TWO WEEKS BEFORE HIS MORTAL WOUND

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The austere, determined features of the victor of Chancellorsville, just
as they appeared two weeks before the tragic shot that cost the
Confederacy its greatest Lieutenant-General--and, in the opinion of sound
historians, its chief hope for independence.Only once had a war
photograph of Jackson been taken up to April, 1863, when, just before the
movement toward Chancellorsville, he was persuaded to enter a
photographer's tent at Hamilton's Crossing, some three miles below
Fredericksburg, and to sit for his last portrait.At a glance one can feel
the self-expression and power in this stern worshiper of the God of
Battles; one can understand the eulogy written by the British military
historian, Henderson: "The fame of 'Stonewall' Jackson is no longer the
exclusive property of Virginia and the South; it has become the birthright
of every man privileged to call himself an American."[Illustration: WHERE "STONEWALL" JACKSON FELL]

In this tangled nook Lee's right-hand man was shot through a terrible
mistake of his own soldiers.After his
brilliant flank march, the evening attack on the rear of Hooker's army had
just been driven home.About half-past eight, Jackson had ridden beyond
his lines to reconnoiter for the final advance.A single rifle-shot rang
out in the darkness.The outposts of the two armies were engaged.Jackson
turned toward his own line, where the Eighteenth North Carolina was
stationed.The regiment, keenly on the alert and startled by the group of
strange horsemen riding through the gloom, fired a volley that brought
several men and horses to the earth.Jackson was struck once in the right
hand and twice in the left arm, a little below the shoulder.His horse
dashed among the trees; but with his bleeding right hand Jackson succeeded
in seizing the reins and turning the frantic animal back into the road.Only with difficulty was the general taken to the rear so that his wounds
might be dressed.To his attendants he said, "Tell them simply that you
have a wounded Confederate officer."To one who asked if he was seriously
hurt, he replied: "Don't bother yourself about me.Win the battle first
and attend to the wounded afterward."He was taken to Guiney's Station.At
first it was hoped that he would recover, but pneumonia set in and his
strength gradually ebbed.On Sunday evening, May 10th, he uttered the
words which inspired the young poet, Sidney Lanier, to write his elegy,
beautiful in its serene resignation.[Illustration: THE STONE WALL AT FREDERICKSBURG

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Behind the deadly stone wall of Marye's Heights after Sedgwick's men had
swept across it in the gallant charge of May 3, 1863.This was one of the
strongest natural positions stormed during the war.In front of this wall
the previous year, nearly 6,000 of Burnside's men had fallen, and it was
not carried.Again in the Chancellorsville campaign Sedgwick's Sixth Corps
was ordered to assault it.It was defended the second time with the same
death-dealing stubbornness but with less than a fourth of the former
numbers--9,000 Confederates against 20,000 Federals.At eleven o'clock in
the morning the line of battle, under Colonel Hiram Burnham, moved out
over the awful field of the year before, supported to right and left by
flanking columns.Up to within twenty-five yards of the wall they pressed,
when again the flame of musketry fire belched forth, laying low in six
minutes 36.5 per cent.The
assailants wavered and rallied, and then with one impulse both columns and
line of battle hurled themselves upon the wall in a fierce hand-to-hand
combat.A soldier of the Seventh Massachusetts happened to peer through a
crack in a board fence and saw that it covered the flank of the double
line of Confederates in the road.Up and over the fence poured the
Federals and drove the Confederates from the heights.[Illustration: THE WORK OF ONE SHELL

Federals swarmed up and over the ridge above, driving the Confederates
from the rifle-pits, capturing the guns of the famous Washington Artillery
which had so long guarded the Heights, and inflicting slaughter upon the
assaulting columns.If Sedgwick had had cavalry he could have crushed the
divided forces of Early and cleared the way for a rapid advance to attack
Lee's rear.In the picture we see Confederate caisson wagons and horses
destroyed by a lucky shot from the Second Massachusetts' siege-gun battery
planted across the river at Falmouth to support Sedgwick's assault.Surveying the scene stands General Herman Haupt, Chief of the Bureau of
Military Railways, the man leaning against the stump.By him is W. W.

Chancellorsville and sent against Sedgwick on the afternoon of the 4th.[Illustration: THE DEMOLISHED HEADQUARTERS]

From this mansion, Hooker's headquarters during the battle of
Chancellorsville, he rode away after the injury he received there on May
3d, never to return.The general, dazed after Jackson's swoop upon the
right, was besides in deep anxiety as to Sedgwick.The latter's forty
thousand men had not yet come up.Hooker was unwilling to suffer further
loss without the certainty of his cooperation.The movement was the signal for increased artillery fire from
the Confederate batteries, marking the doom of the old Chancellor house.Its end was accompanied by some heartrending scenes.Major Bigelow thus
describes them: "Missiles pierced the walls or struck in the brickwork;
shells exploded in the upper rooms, setting the building on fire; the
chimneys were demolished and their fragments rained down upon the wounded
about the building.All this time the women and children (including some
slaves) of the Chancellor family, nineteen persons in all, were in the
cellar.The wounded were removed from in and around the building, men of
both armies nobly assisting one another in the work."[Illustration: RED MEN WHO SUFFERED IN SILENCE

place.We think of him with the tomahawk and scalping-knife and have
difficulty in conceiving him in the ranks, drilling, doing police duty,
and so on.Yet more than three thousand Indians were enlisted in the
Federal army.The Confederates enlisted many more in Missouri, Arkansas,
and Texas.In the Federal army the red men were used as advance
sharpshooters and rendered meritorious service.This photograph shows some
of the wounded Indian sharpshooters on Marye's Heights after the second
battle of Fredericksburg.A hospital orderly is attending to the wants of
the one on the left-hand page, and the wounds of the others have been

group of four Indian sharpshooters, each with the loss of a limb--of an
arm at the shoulder, of a leg at the knee, or with an amputation at the
thigh.They neither spoke nor moaned, but suffered and died, mute in their
agony.During the campaign of 1864, from the Wilderness to Appomattox,
Captain Ely S. Parker, a gigantic Indian, became one of Grant's favorite
aids.Before the close of the war he had been promoted to the rank of
colonel, and it was he who drafted in a beautiful handwriting the terms of
Lee's surrender.He stood over six feet in height and was a conspicuous
figure on Grant's staff.The Southwestern Indians engaged in some of the
earliest battles under General Albert Pike, a Northerner by birth, but a
Southern sympathizer.[Illustration: THE BOMBARDMENT OF PORT HUDSON._Painted by E. Packbauer._

VICKSBURG AND PORT HUDSON

    On the banks of this, the greatest river in the world, the most
    decisive and far-reaching battle of the war was fought.Here at
    Vicksburg over one hundred thousand gallant soldiers and a powerful
    fleet of gunboats and ironclads in terrible earnestness for forty days
    and nights fought to decide whether the new Confederate States should
    be cut in twain; whether the great river should flow free to the Gulf,
    or should have its commerce hindered.We all know the result--the
    Union army under General Grant, and the Union navy under Admiral
    Porter were victorious.The Confederate army, under General Pemberton,
    numbering thirty thousand men, was captured and General Grant's army
    set free for operating in other fields.It was a staggering blow from
    which the Confederacy never rallied.--_Lieutenant-General Stephen D.
    Lee, C. S. A., at the dedication of the Massachusetts Volunteers'
    statue at the Vicksburg National Military Park, Vicksburg,
    Mississippi, November 14, 1903._


The Mississippi River, in its lower course, winds like a mighty serpent
from side to side along a vast alluvial bottom, which in places is more
than forty miles in width.On the eastern bank, these great coils here and
there sweep up to the bluffs of the highlands of Tennessee and
Mississippi.On these cliffs are situated Memphis, Port Hudson, Grand
Gulf, and Vicksburg.The most important of these from a military point of
view was Vicksburg, often called the "Gibraltar of the West."Situated two
hundred feet above the current, on a great bend of the river, its cannon
could command the waterway for miles in either direction, while the
obstacles in the way of a land approach were almost equally
insurmountable.The Union arms had captured New Orleans, in the spring of 1862, and
Memphis in June of that year; but the Confederates still held Vicksburg
and Port Hudson and the two hundred and fifty miles of river that lies
between them.The military object of the Federal armies in the West was
to gain control of the entire course of the great Mississippi that it
might "roll unvexed to the sea," to use Lincoln's terse expression, and
that the rich States of the Southwest, from which the Confederacy drew
large supplies and thousands of men for her armies, might be cut off from
the rest of the South.If Vicksburg were captured, Port Hudson must fall.The problem, therefore, was how to get control of Vicksburg.On the promotion of Halleck to the command of all the armies of the North,
with headquarters at Washington, Grant was left in superior command in the
West and the great task before him was the capture of the "Gibraltar of
the West."Vicksburg might have been occupied by the Northern armies at
any time during the first half of the year 1862, but in June of that year
General Bragg sent Van Dorn with a force of fifteen thousand to occupy and
fortify the heights.Van Dorn was a man of prodigious energy.In a short
time he had hundreds of men at work planting batteries, digging rifle-pits
above the water front and in the rear of the town, mounting heavy guns and
building bomb-proof magazines in tiers along the hillsides.All through
the summer, the work progressed under the direction of Engineer S. H.
Lockett, and by the coming of winter the city was a veritable Gibraltar.From the uncompleted batteries on the Vicksburg bluffs, the citizens and
the garrison soldiers viewed the advance division of Farragut's fleet,
under Commander Lee, in the river, on May 18, 1862.Fifteen hundred
infantry were on board, under command of General Thomas Williams, and with
them was a battery of artillery.Williams reconnoitered the works, and
finding them too strong for his small force he returned to occupy Baton
Rouge.The authorities at Washington now sent Farragut peremptory orders
to clear the Mississippi and accordingly about the middle of June, a
flotilla of steamers and seventeen mortar schooners, under Commander D. D.
Porter, departed from New Orleans and steamed up the river.Simultaneously Farragut headed a fleet of three war vessels and seven
gunboats, carrying one hundred and six guns, toward Vicksburg from Baton
Rouge.Many transports accompanied the ships from Baton Rouge, on which
there were three thousand of Williams' troops.The last days of June witnessed the arrival of the combined naval forces
of Farragut and Porter below the Confederate stronghold.Williams
immediately disembarked his men on the Louisiana shore, opposite
Vicksburg, and they were burdened with implements required in digging
trenches and building levees.The mighty Mississippi, at this point and in those days, swept in a
majestic bend and formed a peninsula of the western, or Louisiana shore.Vicksburg was situated on the eastern, or Mississippi shore, below the top
of the bend.Its batteries of cannon commanded the river approach for
miles in either direction.Federal engineers quickly recognized the
strategic position of the citadel on the bluff; and also as quickly saw a
method by which the passage up and down the river could be made
comparatively safe for their vessels, and at the same time place Vicksburg
"high and dry" by cutting a channel for the Mississippi through the neck
of land that now held it in its sinuous course.While Farragut stormed the Confederate batteries at Vicksburg, Williams
began the tremendous task of diverting the mighty current across the
peninsula.Farragut's bombardment by his entire fleet failed to silence
Vicksburg's cannon-guards, although the defenders likewise failed to stop
the progress of the fleet.The Federal naval commander then determined to
dash past the fortifications, trusting to the speed of his vessels and the
stoutness of their armor to survive the tremendous cannonade that would
fall upon his flotilla.Early in the morning of June 28th the thrilling
race against death began, and after two hours of terrific bombardment
aided by the mortar boats stationed on both banks, Farragut's fleet with
the exception of three vessels passed through the raging inferno to the
waters above Vicksburg, with a loss of fifteen killed and thirty wounded.On the 1st of July Flag-Officer Davis with his river gunboats arrived from
Memphis and joined Farragut.Williams and his men, including one thousand <DW64>s, labored like Titans
to complete their canal, but a sudden rise of the river swept away the
barriers with a terrific roar, and the days of herculean labor went for
naught.Again Williams' attempt to subdue the stronghold was abandoned,
and he returned with his men when Farragut did, on July 24th, to Baton
Rouge to meet death there on August 5th when General Breckinridge made a
desperate but unsuccessful attempt to drive the Union forces from the
Louisiana capital.Farragut urged upon General Halleck the importance of occupying the city
on the bluff with a portion of his army; but that general gave no heed;
and while even then it was too late to secure the prize without a contest,
it would have been easy in comparison to that which it required a year
later.In the mean time, the river steamers took an important part in the
preliminary operations against the city.Davis remained at Memphis with
his fleet for about three weeks after the occupation of that city on the
6th of June, meanwhile sending four gunboats and a transport up the White
River, with the Forty-sixth Indiana regiment, under Colonel Fitch.The
object of the expedition, undertaken at Halleck's command, was to destroy
Confederate batteries and to open communication with General Curtis, who
was approaching from the west.It failed in the latter purpose but did
some effective work with the Southern batteries along the way.The one extraordinary incident of the expedition was the disabling of the
_Mound City_, one of the ironclad gunboats, and the great loss of life
that it occasioned.Charles the troops under Fitch were
landed, and the _Mound City_ moving up the river, was fired on by
concealed batteries under the direction of Lieutenant Dunnington.A
32-pound shot struck the vessel, crashed through the side and passed
through the steam-drum.Many of
the men were so quickly enveloped in the scalding vapor that they had no
chance to escape.Others leaped overboard, some being drowned and some
rescued through the efforts of the _Conestoga_ which was lying near.While
straining every nerve to save their lives, the men had to endure a shower
of bullets from Confederate sharpshooters on the river banks.Of the one
hundred and seventy-five officers and men of the _Mound City_ only
twenty-five escaped death or injury in that fearful catastrophe.Meanwhile, Colonel Fitch with his land forces rushed upon the Confederate
batteries and captured them.The unfortunate vessel was at length repaired
and returned to service.For some time it had been known in Federal military and naval circles that
a powerful ironclad similar to the famous _Monitor_ of Eastern waters was
being rushed to completion up the Yazoo.The new vessel was the
_Arkansas_.On July 15th, she steamed through the Union fleet, bravely
exchanging broadsides, and lodged safely under the guns of Vicksburg.That
evening the Federal boats in turn ran past the doughty _Arkansas_, but
failed to destroy her.The month of July had not been favorable to the Federal hopes.Farragut
had returned to New Orleans.General Williams had gone with him as far as
Baton Rouge.Davis now went with his fleet back to Helena.Halleck was
succeeded by Grant.Vicksburg entered upon a period of quiet.The city's experience of blood and fire
had only begun.During the summer and autumn of 1862, the one thought
uppermost in the mind of General Grant was how to gain possession of the
stronghold.He was already becoming known for his bull-dog tenacity.In
the autumn, two important changes took place, but one day apart.On
October 14th, General John C. Pemberton succeeded Van Dorn in command of
the defenses of Vicksburg, and on the next day David D. Porter succeeded
Davis as commander of the Federal fleet on the upper Mississippi.So arduous was the task of taking Vicksburg that the wits of General
Grant, and those of his chief adviser, General W. T. Sherman, were put to
the test in the last degree to accomplish the end.Grant knew that the
capture of this fortified city was of great importance to the Federal
cause, and that it would ever be looked upon as one of the chief acts in
the drama of the Civil War.The first plan attempted was to divide the army, Sherman taking part of it
from Memphis and down the Mississippi on transports, while Grant should
move southward along the line of the Mississippi Central Railroad to
cooperate with Sherman, his movements to be governed by the efforts of the
scattered Confederate forces in Mississippi to block him.But the whole
plan was destined to failure, through the energies of General Van Dorn and
others of the Confederate army near Grant's line of communication.The authorities at Washington preferred the river move upon Vicksburg, as
the navy could keep the line of communication open.The stronghold now
stood within a strong line of defense extending from Haynes' Bluff on the
Yazoo to Grand Gulf on the Mississippi, thirty miles below Vicksburg.To
prepare for Sherman's attack across the swamps of the Yazoo, Admiral
Porter made several expeditions up that tortuous stream to silence
batteries and remove torpedoes.In one of these he lost one of the Eads
ironclads, the _Cairo_, blown up by a torpedo, and in another the brave
Commander Gwin, one of the heroes of Shiloh, was mortally wounded.Sherman, with an army of thirty-two thousand men, left Memphis on December
20th, and landed a few days later some miles north of Vicksburg on the
banks of the Yazoo.On the 29th he made a daring attack in three columns
on the Confederate lines of defense at Chickasaw Bayou and suffered a
decisive repulse.His loss was nearly two thousand men; the Confederate
loss was scarcely two hundred.Two hundred feet above the bayou, beyond where the Federals were
approaching, towered the Chickasaw Bluffs, to which Pemberton hastened
troops from Vicksburg as soon as he learned Sherman's object.At the base
of the bluff, and stretching away to the north and west were swamps and
forests intersected by deep sloughs, overhung with dense tangles of vines
and cane-brakes.Federal valor vied with Confederate pluck in this fight
among the marshes and fever-infested jungle-land.One of Sherman's storming parties, under General G. W. Morgan, came upon a
broad and deep enlargement of the bayou, McNutt Lake, which interposed
between it and the Confederates in the rifle-pits on the <DW72>s and crest
of the bluff.In the darkness of the night of December 28th, the Federal
pontoniers labored to construct a passage-way across the lake.When
morning dawned the weary pontoniers were chagrined to discover their
well-built structure spanning a slough leading in another direction than
toward the base of the bluff.The bridge was quickly taken up, and the
Federals recommenced their labors, this time in daylight and within sight
and range of the Southern regiments on the hill.The men in blue worked
desperately to complete the span before driven away by the foe's cannon;
but the fire increased with every minute, and the Federals finally
withdrew.Another storming party attempted to assail the Confederates from across a
sandbar of the bayou, but was halted at the sight and prospect of
overcoming a fifteen-foot bank on the farther side.The crumbling bank was
surmounted with a levee three feet high; the steep sides of the barrier
had crumbled away, leaving an overhanging shelf, two feet wide.Two
companies of the Sixth Missouri regiment volunteered to cross the two
hundred yards of exposed passage, and to cut a roadway through the rotten
bank to allow their comrades a free path to the bluff beyond.To add to
the peril of the crossing, the sandbar was strewn with tangles of
undergrowth and fallen trees, and the Confederate shells and bullets were
raining upon the ground.Still, the gallant troops began their dash.From
the very start, a line of wounded and dead Missourians marked the passage
of the volunteers.The survivors reached the bank and desperately sought
to dig the roadway.From the shrubbery on the bank suddenly appeared
Confederate sharpshooters who poured their fire into the laboring
soldiers; the flame of the discharging muskets burned the clothing of the
Federals because the hostile forces were so close.Human endurance could
not stand before this carnage, and the brave Missourians fled from the
inferno.Sherman now found the northern pathway to Vicksburg impassable,
and withdrew his men to the broad Mississippi.Earlier in the same month had occurred two other events which, with the
defeat of Chickasaw, go to make up the triple disaster to the Federals.On
the 11th, General Nathan Forrest, one of the most brilliant cavalry
leaders on either side, began one of those destructive raids which
characterize the Civil War.With twenty-five hundred horsemen, Forrest
dashed unopposed through the country north of Grant's army, tore up sixty
miles of railroad and destroyed all telegraph lines.Meantime, on December 20th, the day on which Sherman left Memphis, General
Van Dorn pounced upon Holly Springs, in Mississippi, like an eagle on its
prey, capturing the guard of fifteen hundred men and burning the great
store of supplies, worth $1,500,000, which Grant had left there.Through
the raids of Forrest and Van Dorn, Grant was left without supplies and for
eleven days without communication with the outside world.He marched
northward to Grand Junction, in Tennessee, a distance of eighty miles,
living off the country.It was not until January 8, 1863, that he heard,
through Washington, of the defeat of Sherman in his assault on Chickasaw
Bluffs.Grant and Sherman had no thought of abandoning Vicksburg because of this
failure.But a month of unfortunate military dissension over rank in the
command of Sherman's army resulted in General John A. McClernand, armed
with authority from Washington, coming down from Illinois and superseding
Sherman.On January 11, 1864, he captured Arkansas Post, a stronghold on
the Arkansas River.But Grant, having authority to supersede McClernand in
the general proceedings against Vicksburg, did so, on January 30th, and
arguments on military precedence were forgotten.Grant was determined to lead his Army of the Tennessee below Vicksburg and
approach the city from the south, without breaking with his base of
supplies up the river.Two projects, both of which were destined to fail,
were under way during the winter and spring months of 1863.One of these
was to open a way for the river craft through Lake Providence, west of the
Mississippi, through various bayous and rivers into the Red River, a
detour of four hundred miles.Another plan was to cut a channel through the peninsula of the great bend
of the Mississippi, opposite Vicksburg.For six weeks, thousands of men
worked like marmots digging this ditch; but, meantime, the river was
rising and, on March 8th, it broke over the embankment and the men had to
run for their lives.Many horses were drowned and a great number of
implements submerged.The "Father of Waters" had put a decisive veto on
the project and it had to be given up.Still another plan that failed was
to cut through the Yazoo Pass and approach from the north by way of the
Coldwater, the Tallahatchie, and the Yazoo rivers.He _would_ take
Vicksburg.It was to transfer
his army by land down the west bank of the Mississippi to a point below
the city and approach it from the south and west.This necessitated the
running of the batteries by Porter's fleet--an extremely perilous
enterprise.The army was divided into four corps, commanded respectively
by Sherman, McClernand, McPherson, and Hurlbut.On March 29th, the movement of McClernand from Milliken's Bend
to a point opposite Grand Gulf was begun.He was soon followed by
McPherson and a few weeks later by Sherman.It required a month for the
army, with its heavy artillery, to journey through the swamps and bogs of
Louisiana.While this march was in progress, something far more exciting was taking
place on the river.Porter ran the batteries of Vicksburg with his fleet.After days of preparation the fleet of vessels, protected by cotton bales
and hay about the vital parts of the boats, with heavy logs slung near the
water-line--seven gunboats, the ram _General Price_, three transports, and
various barges were ready for the dangerous journey on the night of April
16th.Silently in the darkness, they left their station near the mouth of
the Yazoo, at a quarter past nine.For an hour and a half all was silence
and expectancy.The bluffs on the east loomed black against the night sky.Suddenly, the flash of musketry fire pierced the darkness.In a few minutes every battery overlooking the river was a center of
spurting flame.A storm of shot and shell was rained upon the passing
vessels.The water of the river
was lashed into foam by the shots and shell from the batteries.The air was filled with flying
missiles.Several houses on the Louisiana shore burst into flame and the
whole river from shore to shore was lighted with vivid distinctness.A
little later, a giant flame leaped from the bosom of the river.It burned to the
water's edge, nearly all its crew escaping to other vessels.Grant
described the scene as "magnificent, but terrible"; Sherman pronounced it
"truly sublime."By three in the morning, the fleet was below the city and ready to
cooperate with the army.One vessel had been destroyed, several others
were crippled; thirteen men had been wounded, but Grant had the assistance
he needed.About a week later, six more transports performed the same feat
and ran the batteries; each had two barges laden with forage and rations
in tow.Grant's next move was to transfer the army across the river and to secure
a base of supplies.There, on the bluff, was Grand Gulf, a tempting spot.But the Confederate guns showed menacingly over the brow of the hill.After a fruitless bombardment by the fleet on April 29th, it was decided
that a more practical place to cross the river must be sought below.Meanwhile, Sherman was ordered by his chief to advance upon the formidable
Haynes' Bluff, on the Yazoo River, some miles above the scene of his
repulse in the preceding December.The message had said, "Make a
demonstration on Haynes' Bluff, and make all the _show_ possible."Sherman's transports, and three of Porter's gunboats, were closely
followed by the Confederate soldiers who had been stationed at the series
of defenses on the range of hills, and when they arrived at Snyder's Mill,
just below Haynes' Bluff, on April 30th, General Hebert and several
Louisiana regiments were awaiting them.On that day and the next the
Confederates fiercely engaged the Union fleet and troops, and on May 2d
Sherman withdrew his forces to the western bank of the Mississippi and
hastened to Grant.The Confederates
had been prevented from sending reenforcements to Grand Gulf, and Grant's
crossing was greatly facilitated.The fleet passed the batteries of Grand Gulf and stopped at Bruinsburg,
six miles below.A landing was soon made, the army taken across on April
30th, and a march to Port Gibson, twelve miles inland, was begun.General
Bowen, Confederate commander at Grand Gulf, came out and offered battle.He was greatly outnumbered, but his troops fought gallantly throughout
most of the day, May 1st, before yielding the field.Port Gibson was then
occupied by the Union army, and Grand Gulf, no longer tenable, was
abandoned by the Confederates.Grant now prepared for a campaign into the interior of Mississippi.His
first intention was to cooperate with General Banks in the capture of Port
Hudson, after which they would move together upon Vicksburg.But hearing
that Banks would not arrive for ten days, Grant decided that he would
proceed to the task before him without delay.His army at that time
numbered about forty-three thousand.That under Pemberton probably forty
thousand, while there were fifteen thousand Confederate troops at Jackson,
Mississippi, soon to be commanded by General Joseph E. Johnston, who was
hastening to that capital.The Federal leader now determined on the bold plan of making a dash into
the interior of Mississippi, beating Johnston and turning on Pemberton
before their forces could be joined.This campaign is pronounced the most
brilliant in the Civil War.It was truly Napoleonic in conception and
execution.Grant knew that his base of supplies at Grand Gulf would be cut
off by Pemberton as soon as he moved away from it.He decided, therefore,
against the advice of his generals, to abandon his base altogether.With a few days'
rations in their haversacks the troops were to make a dash that would
possibly take several weeks into the heart of a hostile country.When General Halleck heard of Grant's daring
scheme he wired the latter from Washington, ordering him to move his army
down the river and cooperate with Banks.Fortunately, this order was
received too late to interfere with Grant's plans.As soon as Sherman's divisions joined the main army the march was begun,
on May 7th.An advance of this character must be made with the greatest
celerity and Grant's army showed amazing speed.McPherson, who commanded
the right wing, proceeded toward Jackson by way of Raymond and at the
latter place encountered five thousand Confederates, on May 12th, who
blocked his way and were prepared for fight.McPherson was completely successful and the Confederates
hastened to join their comrades in Jackson.He moved on toward Jackson, and as the last of his
command left Raymond the advance of Sherman's corps reached it.That
night, May 13th, Grant ordered McPherson and Sherman to march upon Jackson
next morning by different roads, while McClernand was held in the rear
near enough to reenforce either in case of need.The rain fell in torrents
that night and, as Grant reported, in places the water was a foot deep in
the road.At eleven o'clock
in the morning of the 14th, a concerted attack was made on the capital of
Mississippi.A few hours' brisk fighting concluded this act of the drama,
and the Stars and Stripes were unfurled on the State capitol.Among the
spoils were seventeen heavy guns.That night, Grant slept in the house
which Johnston had occupied the night before.Meantime, Johnston had ordered Pemberton to detain Grant by attacking him
in the rear.But Pemberton considered it more advisable to move toward
Grand Gulf to separate Grant from his base of supplies, not knowing that
Grant had abandoned his base.And now, with Johnston's army scattered,
Grant left Sherman to burn bridges and military factories, and to tear up
the railroads about Jackson while he turned fiercely on Pemberton.McPherson's corps took the lead.Grant called on McClernand to follow
without delay.Then, hearing that Pemberton was marching toward him, he
called on Sherman to hasten from Jackson.At Champion's Hill (Baker's
Creek) Pemberton stood in the way, with eighteen thousand men.The battle was soon in progress--the heaviest of the campaign.It
continued for seven or eight hours.The Confederates were defeated with a
loss of nearly all their artillery and about half their force, including
four thousand men who were cut off from the main army and failed to rejoin
it.On the banks of the Big Black River, a few miles westward, the
Confederates made another stand, and here the fifth battle of the
investment of Vicksburg took place.The
Confederates suffered heavy losses and the remainder hastened to the
defenses of Vicksburg.They had set fire to the bridge across the Big
Black, and Grant's army was detained for a day--until the Confederates
were safely lodged in the city.The Federal army now invested Vicksburg, occupying the surrounding hills.It was May 18th when the remarkable campaign to reach Vicksburg came to an
end.In eighteen days, the army had marched one hundred and eighty miles
through a hostile country, fought and won five battles, captured a State
capital, had taken twenty-seven heavy cannon and sixty field-pieces, and
had slain or wounded six thousand men and captured as many more.As Grant
and Sherman rode out on the hill north of the city, the latter broke into
enthusiastic admiration of his chief, declaring that up to that moment he
had felt no assurance of success, and pronouncing the campaign one of the
greatest in history.The great problem of investing Vicksburg was solved at last.Around the
doomed city gleamed the thousands of bayonets of the Union army.The
inhabitants and the army that had fled to it as a city of refuge were
penned in.But the Confederacy was not to yield without a stubborn
resistance.On May 19th, an advance was made on the works and the
besieging lines drew nearer and tightened their coils.Three days later,
on May 22nd, Grant ordered a grand assault by his whole army.The troops,
flushed with their victories of the past three weeks, were eager for the
attack.All the corps commanders set their watches by Grant's in order to
begin the assault at all points at the same moment--ten o'clock in the
morning.At the appointed time, the cannon from the encircling lines burst
forth in a deafening roar.Then came the answering thunders from the
mortar-boats on the Louisiana shore and from the gunboats anchored beneath
the bluff.The gunboats' fire was answered from within the bastions
protecting the city.The opening of the heavy guns on the land side was
followed by the sharper crackle of musketry--thousands of shots,
indistinguishable in a continuous roll.The men in the Federal lines leaped from their hiding places and ran to
the parapets in the face of a murderous fire from the defenders of the
city, only to be mowed down by hundreds.Others came, crawling over the
bodies of their fallen comrades--now and then they planted their colors on
the battlements of the besieged city, to be cut down by the galling
Confederate fire.Thus it continued hour after hour, until the coming of
darkness.The Union loss was about three thousand
brave men; the Confederate loss was probably not much over five hundred.Grant had made a fearful sacrifice; he was paying a high price but he had
a reason for so doing--Johnston with a reenforcing army was threatening
him in the rear; by taking Vicksburg at this time he could have turned on
Johnston, and could have saved the Government sending any more Federal
troops; and, to use his own words, it was needed because the men "would
not have worked in the trenches with the same zeal, believing it
unnecessary, as they did after their failure, to carry the enemy's works."On the north side of the city overlooking the river, were the powerful
batteries on Fort Hill, a deadly menace to the Federal troops, and Grant
and Sherman believed that if enfiladed by the gunboats this position could
be carried.At their request Admiral Porter sent the _Cincinnati_ on May
27th to engage the Confederate guns, while four vessels below the town did
the same to the lower defenses.In half an hour five of the
_Cincinnati's_ guns were disabled; and she was in a sinking condition.She
was run toward the shore and sank in three fathoms of water.The army now settled down to a wearisome siege.For six weeks, they
encircled the city with trenches, approaching nearer and nearer to the
defending walls; they exploded mines; they shot at every head that
appeared above the parapets.One by one the defending batteries were
silenced.The sappers slowly worked their way toward the Confederate
ramparts.Miners were busy on both sides burrowing beneath the
fortifications.At three o'clock on the afternoon of June 25th a redoubt
in the Confederate works was blown into the air, breaking into millions of
fragments and disclosing guns, men, and timber.With the mine explosion,
the Federal soldiers before the redoubt began to dash into the opening,
only to meet with a withering fire from an interior parapet which the
Confederates had constructed in anticipation of this event.The carnage
was appalling to behold; and when the soldiers of the Union finally
retired they had learned a costly lesson which withheld them from attack
when another mine was exploded on July 1st.Meantime, let us take a view of the river below and the life of the people
within the doomed city.Far down the river, two hundred and fifty miles
from Vicksburg, was Port Hudson.The place was fortified and held by a
Confederate force under General Gardner.Like Vicksburg, it was besieged
by a Federal army, under Nathaniel P. Banks, of Cedar Mountain fame.On
May 27th, he made a desperate attack on the works and was powerfully aided
by Farragut with his fleet in the river.But aside from dismounting a few
guns and weakening the foe at a still heavier cost to their own ranks, the
Federals were unsuccessful.Again, on June 10th, and still again on the
14th, Banks made fruitless attempts to carry Port Hudson by storm.He
then, like Grant at Vicksburg, settled down to a siege.The defenders of
Port Hudson proved their courage by enduring every hardship.At Vicksburg, during the whole six weeks of the siege, the men in the
trenches worked steadily, advancing the coils about the city.Grant
received reenforcement and before the end of the siege his army numbered
over seventy thousand.Day and night, the roar of artillery continued.From the mortars across the river and from Porter's fleet the shrieking
shells rose in grand parabolic curves, bursting in midair or in the
streets of the city, spreading havoc in all directions.The people of the
city burrowed into the ground for safety.Many whole families lived in
these dismal abodes, their walls of clay being shaken by the roaring
battles that raged above the ground.In one of these dens, sixty-five
people found a home.The food supply ran low, and day by day it became
scarcer.At last, by the end of June, there was nothing to eat except mule
meat and a kind of bread made of beans and corn meal.It was ten o'clock in the morning of July 3d.White flags were seen above
the parapet.A strange quietness rested over the scene
of the long bombardment.On the afternoon of that day, the one, too, on
which was heard the last shot on the battlefield of Gettysburg, Grant and
Pemberton stood beneath an oak tree, in front of McPherson's corps, and
opened negotiations for the capitulation.On the following morning, the
Nation's birthday, about thirty thousand soldiers laid down their arms as
prisoners of war and were released on parole.The losses from May 1st to
the surrender were about ten thousand on each side.Three days later, at Port Hudson, a tremendous cheer arose from the
besieging army.The Confederates within the defenses were at a loss to
know the cause.Then some one shouted the news, "Vicksburg has
surrendered!"Port Hudson could not hope to stand alone; the greater
fortress had fallen.Two days later, July 9th, the gallant garrison, worn
and weary with the long siege, surrendered to General Banks.The whole
course of the mighty Mississippi was now under the Stars and Stripes.[Illustration: BEFORE VICKSBURG]

The close-set mouth, squared shoulders and lowering brow in this
photograph of Grant, taken in December, 1862, tell the story of the
intensity of his purpose while he was advancing upon Vicksburg--only to be
foiled by Van Dorn's raid on his line of communications at Holly Springs.His grim expression and determined jaw betokened no respite for the
Confederates, however.Six months later he marched into the coveted
stronghold.This photograph was taken by James Mullen at Oxford,
Mississippi, in December, 1862, just before Van Dorn's raid balked the
general's plans.[Illustration: AFTER VICKSBURG]

This photograph was taken in the fall of 1863, after the capture of the
Confederacy's Gibraltar had raised Grant to secure and everlasting fame.His attitude is relaxed and his eyebrows no longer mark a straight line
across the grim visage.The right brow is slightly arched with an almost
jovial expression.But the jaw is no less vigorous and determined, and the
steadfast eyes seem to be peering into that future which holds more
victories.He still has Chattanooga and his great campaigns in the East to
fight and the final magnificent struggle in the trenches at Petersburg.[Illustration: WHERE GRANT'S CAMPAIGN WAS HALTED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The second attempt to capture
Vicksburg originated with Grant.Since he had sprung into fame at Fort
Donelson early in 1862, he had done little to strengthen his reputation;
but to all urgings of his removal Lincoln replied: "I can't spare this
man; he fights."He proposed to push southward through Mississippi to
seize Jackson, the capital.If this could be accomplished, Vicksburg
(fifty miles to the west) would become untenable.At Washington his plan
was overruled to the extent of dividing his forces.Sherman, with a
separate expedition, was to move from Memphis down the Mississippi
directly against Vicksburg.It was Grant's hope that by marching on he
could unite with Sherman in an assault upon this key to the Mississippi.Pushing forward from Grand Junction, sixty miles, Grant reached Oxford
December 5, 1862, but his supplies were still drawn from Columbus,
Kentucky, over a single-track road to Holly Springs, and thence by wagon
over roads which were rapidly becoming impassable.Delay ensued in which
Van Dorn destroyed Federal stores at Holly Springs worth $1,500,000.This
put an end to Grant's advance.In the picture we see an Illinois regiment
guarding some of the 1200 Confederate prisoners taken during the advance
and here confined in the Courthouse.[Illustration: WHERE VICKSBURG'S FATE WAS SEALED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here on May 16, 1863, Grant crowned
his daring maneuver against Vicksburg from the south with complete
success.Once across the river below Grand Gulf, after an easy victory at
Port Gibson, he was joined by Sherman.The army struck out across the
strange country south of the Big Black River and soon had driven
Pemberton's southern outposts across that stream.Grant was now on solid
ground; he had successfully turned the flank of the Confederates and he
grasped the opportunity to strike a telling blow.Pressing forward to
Raymond and Jackson, he captured both, and swept westward to meet the
astounded Pemberton, still vacillating between attempting a junction with
Johnston or attacking Grant in the rear.But Grant, moving with wonderful
precision, prevented either movement.On May 16th a battle ensued which
was most decisive around Champion's Hill.Pemberton was routed and put to
flight, and on the next day the Federals seized the crossings of the Big
Black River.Spiking their guns at Haynes' Bluff, the Confederates retired
into Vicksburg, never to come out again except as prisoners.In eighteen
days from the time he crossed the Mississippi, Grant had gained the
advantage for which the Federals had striven for more than a year at
Vicksburg.[Illustration: THE BRIDGE THE CONFEDERATES BURNED AT BIG BLACK RIVER

of the Big Black River Bridge early on May 17, 1863.McClernand's division carried the defenses and Bowen and Vaughn's
men fled with precipitate haste over the dreary swamp to the river and
crossed over and burned the railroad and other bridges just in time to
prevent McClernand from following.The necessary delay was aggravating to
Grant's forces.The rest of the day and night was consumed in building
bridges.Sherman had the only pontoon-train with the army and his bridge
was the first ready at Bridgeport, early in the evening.[Illustration: Vicksburg, taken under fire.COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]THE GATE TO THE MISSISSIPPI

The handwriting is that of Surgeon Bixby, of the Union hospital ship "Red
Rover."In his album he pasted this unique photograph from the western
shore of the river where the Federal guns and mortars threw a thousand
shells into Vicksburg during the siege.The prominent building is the
courthouse, the chief landmark during the investment.Here at Vicksburg
the Confederates were making their last brave stand for the possession of
the Mississippi River, that great artery of traffic.If it were wrested
from them the main source of their supplies would be cut off.Pemberton, a
brave and capable officer and a Pennsylvanian by birth, worked
unremittingly for the cause he had espoused.Warned by the early attacks
of General Williams and Admiral Farragut, he had left no stone unturned to
render Vicksburg strongly defended.It had proved impregnable to attack on
the north and east, and the powerful batteries planted on the river-front
could not be silenced by the fleet nor by the guns of the Federals on the
opposite shore.But Grant's masterful maneuver of cutting loose from his
base and advancing from the south had at last out-generaled both Pemberton
and Johnston.Nevertheless, Pemberton stoutly held his defenses.His high
river-battery is photographed below, as it frowned upon the Federals
opposite.[Illustration]


[Illustration: THE WELL-DEFENDED CITADEL

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Behind these fortifications Pemberton, driven from the Big Black River,
gathered his twenty-one thousand troops to make the last stand for the
saving of the Mississippi to the Confederacy.In the upper picture we see
Fort Castle, one of the strongest defenses of the Confederacy.It had full
sweep of the river; here "Whistling Dick" (one of the most powerful guns
in possession of the South) did deadly work.In the lower picture we see
the fortifications to the east of the town, before which Grant's army was
now entrenching.When Vicksburg had first been threatened in 1862, the
Confederate fortifications had been laid out and work begun on them in
haste with but five hundred spades, many of the soldiers delving with
their bayonets.The sites were so well chosen and the work so well done
that they had withstood attacks for a year.They were to hold out still
longer.By May 18th the Federals had completely invested Vicksburg, and
Grant and Sherman rode out to Haynes' Bluff to view the open river to the
north, down which abundant supplies were now coming for the army.Sherman,
who had not believed that the plan could succeed, frankly acknowledged his
mistake.Sherman, assaulting the
fortifications of Vicksburg, the next day, was repulsed.A second attack,
on the 22d, failed and on the 25th Grant settled down to starve Pemberton
out.[Illustration]


[Illustration: THE WORK OF THE BESIEGERS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Battery Sherman, on the Jackson Road, before Vicksburg.Settling down to a
siege did not mean idleness for Grant's army.Fortifications had to be
opposed to the formidable one of the Confederates and a constant
bombardment kept up to silence their guns, one by one.It was to be a
drawn-out duel in which Pemberton, hoping for the long-delayed relief from
Johnston, held out bravely against starvation and even mutiny.For twelve
miles the Federal lines stretched around Vicksburg, investing it to the
river bank, north and south.More than eighty-nine battery positions were
constructed by the Federals.Battery Sherman was exceptionally well
built--not merely revetted with rails or cotton-bales and floored with
rough timber, as lack of proper material often made necessary.Gradually
the lines were drawn closer and closer as the Federals moved up their guns
to silence the works that they had failed to take in May.At the time of
the surrender Grant had more than 220 guns in position, mostly of heavy
caliber.By the 1st of July besieged and besiegers faced each other at a
distance of half-pistol shot.Starving and ravaged by disease, the
Confederates had repelled repeated attacks which depleted their forces,
while Grant, reenforced to three times their number, was showered with
supplies and ammunition that he might bring about the long-delayed victory
which the North had been eagerly awaiting since Chancellorsville.[Illustration: INVESTING BY INCHES

sapping and mining, which finally resulted in the wrecking of the fort so
gallantly defended by the veterans of the Third Louisiana.As the Federal
lines crept up, the men working night and day were forced to live in
burrows.They became proficient in such gopher work as the picture shows.Up to the "White House" (Shirley's) the troops could be marched in
comparative safety, but a short distance beyond they were exposed to the
Confederate sharpshooters, who had only rifles and muskets to depend on;
their artillery had long since been silenced.Near this house was
constructed "Coonskin's" Tower; it was built of railway iron and
cross-ties under the direction of Second Lieutenant Henry C. Foster, of
Company B, Twenty-third Indiana.A backwoodsman and dead-shot, he was
particularly active in paying the Confederate sharpshooters in their own
coin.He habitually wore a cap of raccoon fur, which gave him his nickname
and christened the tower, from which the interior of the Confederate works
could be seen.[Illustration: THE FIRST MONUMENT AT THE MEETING PLACE]

Independence Day, 1863, was a memorable anniversary of the nation's birth;
it brought to the anxious North the momentous news that Meade had won at
Gettysburg and that Vicksburg had fallen in the West.The marble shaft in
the picture was erected to mark the spot where Grant and Pemberton met on
July 3d to confer about the surrender.Under a tree, within a few hundred
feet of the Confederate lines, Grant greeted his adversary as an old
acquaintance.They had fought in the same division for a time in the
Mexican War.Each spoke but two sentences as to the surrender, for Grant
lived up to the nickname he gained at Donelson, and Pemberton's pride was
hurt.The former comrades walked and talked awhile on other things, and
then returned to their lines.Next day the final terms were arranged by
correspondence, and the Confederates marched out with colors flying; they
stacked their arms and, laying their colors upon them, marched back into
the city to be paroled.Those who signed the papers not to fight until
exchanged numbered 29,391.The tree where the commanders met was soon
carried away, root and branch, by relic-hunters.Subsequently the monument
which replaced it was chipped gradually into bits, and in 1866 a
64-pounder cannon took its place as a permanent memorial.[Illustration: VICKSBURG IN POSSESSION OF THE FEDERALS

was actively patrolling the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers.It was soon
seen that the hold upon Tennessee and Kentucky gained by the Federals by
the fall of Forts Henry and Donelson would be lost without adequate
assistance from the navy, and Admiral Porter was authorized to purchase
small light-draft river steamers and add them to Fitch's flotilla as
rapidly as they could be converted into gunboats.One of the first to be
completed was the "Silver Lake."The little stern-wheel steamer first
distinguished herself on February 3, 1863, at Dover, Tennessee, where she
(with Fitch's flotilla) assisted in routing 4,500 Confederates, who were
attacking the Federals at that place.The little vessel continued to
render yeoman's service with the other gunboats, ably assisted by General
A. W. Ellet's marine brigade.[Illustration]

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The Levee at Vicksburg, February, 1864.For seven months the Federals had
been in possession of the city, and the Mississippi--now open through its
entire course--cut off the struggling Confederacy in the East from the
South and Southwest, the storehouses of their resources and their main
dependence in continuing the struggle.But even such a blow as this,
coming on top of Gettysburg, did not force the brave people of the South
to give up the struggle.In the picture the only remaining warlike signs
are the tents on the opposite shore.But on both sides of the river the
Confederates were still desperately striving to reunite their territory.In the East another year and more of the hardest kind of fighting was
ahead; another severing in twain of the South was inevitable before peace
could come, and before the muskets could be used to shoot the crows, and
before their horses could plough the neglected fields.WITHIN THE PARAPET AT PORT HUDSON IN THE SUMMER OF 1863

These fortifications withstood every attack of Banks' powerful army from
May 24 to July 9, 1863.Like Vicksburg, Port Hudson could be reduced only
by a weary siege.These pictures, taken within the fortifications, show in
the distance the ground over which the investing army approached to the
two unsuccessful grand assaults they made upon the Confederate defenders.A continuous line of parapet,
equally strong, had been thrown up for the defense of Port Hudson,
surrounding the town for a distance of three miles and more, each end
terminating on the riverbank.Four powerful forts were located at the
salients, and the line throughout was defended by thirty pieces of field
artillery.Brigadier-General Beall, who commanded the post in 1862,
constructed these works.Major-General Frank Gardner succeeded him in
command at the close of the year.[Illustration: THE WELL-DEFENDED WORKS]

[Illustration: CONFEDERATE FORTIFICATIONS BEFORE PORT HUDSON]

Gardner was behind these defenses with a garrison of about seven thousand
when Banks approached Port Hudson for the second time on May 24th.Gardner
was under orders to evacuate the place and join his force to that of
Johnston at Jackson, Mississippi, but the courier who brought the order
arrived at the very hour when Banks began to bottle up the Confederates.On the morning of May 25th Banks drove in the Confederate skirmishers and
outposts and, with an army of thirty thousand, invested the fortifications
from the eastward.At 10 A.M., after an artillery duel of more than four
hours, the Federals advanced to the assault of the works.Fighting in a
dense forest of magnolias, amid thick undergrowth and among ravines choked
with felled timber, the progress of the troops was too slow for a telling
attack.The battle has been described as "a gigantic bushwhack."The
Federals at the center reached the ditch in front of the Confederate works
but were driven off.It had cost
Banks nearly two thousand men.[Illustration: THE GUN THAT FOOLED THE FEDERALS]

A "Quaker gun" that was mounted by the Confederates in the fortifications
on the bluff at the river-front before Port Hudson.This gun was hewn out
of a pine log and mounted on a carriage, and a black ring was painted
around the end facing the river.Throughout the siege it was mistaken by
the Federals for a piece of real ordnance.To such devices as this the
beleaguered garrison was compelled constantly to resort in order to
impress the superior forces investing Port Hudson with the idea that the
position they sought to capture was formidably defended.Port Hudson was not again attacked from the river after the
passing of Farragut's two ships.[Illustration: WITHIN "THE CITADEL"

In the fight with the batteries at Port Hudson, March 14, 1863, Farragut,
in the "Hartford" lashed to the "Albatross," got by, but the fine old
consort of the "Hartford," the "Mississippi," went down--her gunners
fighting to the last.Farragut, in anguish, could see her enveloped in
flames lighting up the river.She had grounded under the very guns of a
battery, and not until actually driven off by the flames did her men
leave her.When the "Mississippi" grounded, the shock threw her
lieutenant-commander into the river, and in confusion he swam toward the
shore; then, turning about, he swam back to his ship.Captain Smith thus
writes in his report: "I consider that I should be neglecting a most
important duty should I omit to mention the coolness of my executive
officer, Mr.Dewey, and the steady, fearless, and gallant manner in which
the officers and men of the 'Mississippi' defended her, and the orderly
and quiet manner in which she was abandoned after being thirty-five
minutes aground under the fire of the enemy's batteries.There was no
confusion in embarking the crew, and the only noise was from the enemy's
cannon."Lieutenant-Commander George Dewey, here mentioned at the age of
26, was to exemplify in Manila Bay on May 1, 1898, the lessons he was
learning from Farragut.[Illustration]

DURING THE FAMOUS ADDRESS IN DEDICATION OF THE CEMETERY

The most important American address is brief: "Fourscore and seven years
ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in
liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or
any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.We are met on a
great battlefield of that war.We have come to dedicate a portion of that
field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives that
that nation might live.It is altogether fitting and proper that we should
do this.But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate,
we cannot hallow this ground.The brave men, living and dead, who
struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or
detract.The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here,
but it can never forget what they did here.It is for us, the living,
rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought
here have thus far so nobly advanced.It is rather for us to be here
dedicated to the great task remaining before us;--that from these honored
dead, we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the
last full measure of devotion;--that we here highly resolve that these
dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have
a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people,
for the people, shall not perish from the earth."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG--THE HIGH-WATER MARK OF THE CIVIL WAR


The military operations of the American Civil War were carried on for the
most part south of the Mason and Dixon line; but the greatest and most
famous of the battles was fought on the soil of the old Keystone State,
which had given birth to the Declaration of Independence and to the
Constitution of the United States.Gettysburg is a quiet hamlet, nestling among the hills of Adams County,
and in 1863 contained about fifteen hundred inhabitants.It had been
founded in 1780 by James Gettys, who probably never dreamed that his name
thus given to the village would, through apparently accidental
circumstances, become famous in history for all time.The hills immediately around Gettysburg are not rugged or precipitous;
they are little more than gentle swells of ground, and many of them were
covered with timber when the hosts of the North and the legions of the
South fought out the destiny of the American republic on those memorable
July days in 1863.Lee's army was flushed with victory after Chancellorsville and was
strengthened by the memory of Fredericksburg.Southern hopes were high
after Hooker's defeat on the Rappahannock, in May, 1863, and public
opinion was unanimous in demanding an invasion of Northern soil.On the
other hand, the Army of the Potomac, under its several leaders, had met
with continual discouragement, and, with all its patriotism and valor, its
two years' warfare showed but few bright pages to cheer the heart of the
war-broken soldier, and to inspire the hopes of the anxious public in the
North.Leaving General Stuart with ten thousand cavalry and a part of Hill's
corps to prevent Hooker from pursuing, Lee crossed the Potomac early in
June, 1863, concentrated his army at Hagerstown, Maryland, and prepared
for a campaign in Pennsylvania, with Harrisburg as the objective.His army
was organized in three corps, under the respective commands of Longstreet,
Ewell, and A. P. Hill.Lee had divided his army so as to approach
Harrisburg by different routes and to assess the towns along the way for
large sums of money.Late in June, he was startled by the intelligence
that Stuart had failed to detain Hooker, and that the Federals had crossed
the Potomac and were in hot pursuit.Lee was quick to see that his plans must be changed.He knew that to
continue his march he must keep his army together to watch his pursuing
antagonist, and that such a course in this hostile country would mean
starvation, while the willing hands of the surrounding populace would
minister to the wants of his foe.Again, if he should scatter his forces
that they might secure the necessary supplies, the parts would be attacked
singly and destroyed.Lee saw, therefore, that he must abandon his
invasion of the North or turn upon his pursuing foe and disable him in
order to continue his march.But that foe was a giant of strength and
courage, more than equal to his own; and the coming together of two such
forces in a mighty death-struggle meant that a great battle must be
fought, a greater battle than this Western world had hitherto known.The Army of the Potomac had again changed leaders, and George Gordon Meade
was now its commander.Hooker, after a dispute with Halleck, resigned his
leadership, and Meade, the strongest of the corps commanders, was
appointed in his place, succeeding him on June 28th.The two great
armies--Union and Confederate--were scattered over portions of Maryland
and southern Pennsylvania.Both were marching northward, along almost
parallel lines.The Confederates were gradually pressing toward the east,
while the Federals were marching along a line eastward of that followed by
the Confederates.The new commander of the Army of the Potomac was keeping
his forces interposed between the legions of Lee and the Federal capital,
and watching for an opportunity to force the Confederates to battle where
the Federals would have the advantage of position.It was plain that they
must soon come together in a gigantic contest; but just where the shock of
battle would take place was yet unknown.Meade had ordered a general
movement toward Harrisburg, and General Buford was sent with four thousand
cavalry to intercept the Confederate advance guard.On the night of June 30th Buford encamped on a low hill, a mile west of
Gettysburg, and here on the following morning the famous battle had its
beginning.On the morning of July 1st the two armies were still scattered, the
extremes being forty miles apart.But General Reynolds, with two corps of
the Union army, was but a few miles away, and was hastening to Gettysburg,
while Longstreet and Hill were approaching from the west.Buford opened
the battle against Heth's division of Hill's corps.Reynolds soon joined
Buford, and three hours before noon the battle was in progress on Seminary
Ridge.Reynolds rode out to his fighting-lines on the ridge, and while
placing his troops, a little after ten o'clock in the morning, he received
a sharpshooter's bullet in the brain.John F. Reynolds, who had been promoted for gallantry at Buena Vista
in the Mexican War, was one of the bravest and ablest generals of the
Union army.No casualty of the war brought more widespread mourning to the
North than the death of Reynolds.But even this calamity could not stay the fury of the battle.By one
o'clock both sides had been greatly reenforced, and the battle-line
extended north of the town from Seminary Ridge to the bank of Rock Creek.Here for hours the roar of the battle was unceasing.About the middle of
the afternoon a breeze lifted the smoke that had enveloped the whole
battle-line in darkness, and revealed the fact that the Federals were
being pressed back toward Gettysburg.General Carl Schurz, who after
Reynolds' death directed the extreme right near Rock Creek, leaving nearly
half of his men dead or wounded on the field, retreated toward Cemetery
Hill, and in passing through the town the Confederates pursued and
captured a large number of the remainder.The left wing, now unable to
hold its position owing to the retreat of the right, was also forced back,
and it, too, took refuge on Cemetery Hill, which had been selected by
General O. O. Howard; and the first day's fight was over.It was several
hours before night, and had the Southerners known of the disorganized
condition of the Union troops, they might have pursued and captured a
large part of the army.Meade, who was still some miles from the field,
hearing of the death of Reynolds, had sent Hancock to take general command
until he himself should arrive.Hancock had ridden at full speed and arrived on the field between three
and four o'clock in the afternoon.His presence soon brought order out of
chaos.His superb bearing, his air of confidence, his promise of heavy
reenforcements during the night, all tended to inspire confidence and to
renew hope in the ranks of the discouraged army.Had this day ended the
affair at Gettysburg, the usual story of the defeat of the Army of the
Potomac would have gone forth to the world.Only the advance portions of
both armies had been engaged; and yet the battle had been a formidable
one.A great commander had fallen, and the rank
and file had suffered the fearful loss of ten thousand men.Meade reached the scene late in the night, and chose to make this field,
on which the advance of both armies had accidentally met, the place of a
general engagement.Lee had come to the same decision, and both called on
their outlying legions to make all possible speed to Gettysburg.Before
morning, nearly all the troops of both armies had reached the field.The
Union army rested with its center on Cemetery Ridge, with its right thrown
around to Culp's Hill and its left extended southward toward the rocky
peak called Round Top.The Confederate army, with its center on Seminary
Ridge, its wings extending from beyond Rock Creek on the north to a point
opposite Round Top on the south, lay in a great semi-circle, half
surrounding the Army of the Potomac.First,
"Stonewall" Jackson was gone, and second, Stuart was absent with his ten
thousand cavalry.Furthermore, Meade was on the defensive, and had the
advantage of occupying the inner ring of the huge half circle.Thus lay
the two mighty hosts, awaiting the morning, and the carnage that the day
was to bring.It seemed that the fate of the Republic was here to be
decided, and the people of the North and the South watched with breathless
eagerness for the decision about to be made at Gettysburg.The dawn of July 2d betokened a beautiful summer day in southern
Pennsylvania.The hours of the night had been spent by the two armies in
marshaling of battalions and maneuvering of corps and divisions, getting
into position for the mighty combat of the coming day.But, when morning
dawned, both armies hesitated, as if unwilling to begin the task of
bloodshed.They remained inactive, except for a stray shot here and there,
until nearly four o'clock in the afternoon.The fighting on this second day was chiefly confined to the two extremes,
the centers remaining comparatively inactive.Longstreet commanded the
Confederate right, and opposite him on the Union left was General Daniel
E. Sickles.The Confederate left wing, under Ewell, was opposite Slocum
and the Union right stationed on Culp's Hill.The plan of General Meade had been to have the corps commanded by General
Sickles connect with that of Hancock and extend southward near the base of
the Round Tops.Sickles found this ground low and disadvantageous as a
fighting-place.In his front he saw the high ground along the ridge on the
side of which the peach orchard was situated, and advanced his men to this
position, placing them along the Emmitsburg road, and back toward the
Trostle farm and the wheat-field, thus forming an angle at the peach
orchard.The left flank of Hancock's line now rested far behind the right
flank of Sickles' forces.The Third Corps was alone in its position in
advance of the Federal line.The Confederate troops later marched along
Sickles' front so that Longstreet's corps overlapped the left wing of the
Union army.The Northerners grimly watched the bristling cannon and the
files of men that faced them across the valley, as they waited for the
battle to commence.The boom of cannon from Longstreet's batteries announced the beginning of
the second day's battle.Lee had ordered Longstreet to attack Sickles in
full force.The fire was quickly answered by the Union troops, and before
long the fight extended from the peach orchard through the wheatfield and
along the whole line to the base of Little Round Top.The musketry
commenced with stray volleys here and there--then more and faster, until
there was one continuous roar, and no ear could distinguish one shot from
another.Longstreet swept forward in a magnificent line of battle, a mile
and a half long.He pressed back the Union infantry, and was seriously
threatening the artillery.At the extreme left, close to the Trostle house, Captain John Bigelow
commanded the Ninth Battery, Massachusetts Light Artillery.He was ordered
to hold his position at all hazards until reenforced.With double charges
of grape and canister, again and again he tore great gaps in the advancing
line, but it re-formed and pressed onward until the men in gray reached
the muzzles of the Federal guns.Again Bigelow fired, but the heroic band
had at last to give way to the increased numbers of the attack, which
finally resulted in a hand-to-hand struggle with a Mississippi regiment.Bigelow was wounded, and twenty-eight of his hundred and four men were
left on the bloody field, while he lost sixty-five out of eighty-eight
horses, and four of six guns.Such was one of many deeds of heroism
enacted at Gettysburg.But the most desperate struggle of the day was the fight for the
possession of Little Round Top.Just before the action began General Meade
sent his chief engineer, General G. K. Warren, to examine conditions on
the Union left.The battle was raging in the peach orchard when he came to
Little Round Top.It was unoccupied at the time, and Warren quickly saw
the great importance of preventing its occupation by the Confederates, for
the hill was the key to the whole battle-ground west and south of Cemetery
Ridge.Before long, the engineer saw Hood's division of Longstreet's corps
moving steadily toward the hill, evidently determined to occupy it.Had
Hood succeeded, the result would have been most disastrous to the Union
army, for the Confederates could then have subjected the entire Union
lines on the western edge of Cemetery Ridge to an enfilading fire.Warren
and a signal officer seized flags and waved them, to deceive the
Confederates as to the occupation of the height.Sykes' corps, marching to
the support of the left, soon came along, and Warren, dashing down the
side of the hill to meet it, caused the brigade under Colonel Vincent and
a part of that under General Weed to be detached, and these occupied the
coveted position.Hazlett's battery was dragged by hand up the rugged
<DW72> and planted on the summit.Meantime Hood's forces had come up the hill, and were striving at the very
summit; and now occurred one of the most desperate hand-to-hand conflicts
of the war--in which men forgot that they were human and tore at each
other like wild beasts.The opposing forces, not having time to reload,
charged each other with bayonets--men assaulted each other with clubbed
muskets--the Blue and the Gray grappled in mortal combat and fell dead,
side by side.The privates in the front ranks fought their way onward
until they fell, the officers sprang forward, seized the muskets from the
hands of the dying and the dead, and continued the combat.The furious
struggle continued for half an hour, when Hood's forces gave way and were
pressed down the hillside.But they rallied and advanced again by way of a
ravine on the left, and finally, after a most valiant charge, were driven
back at the point of the bayonet.Little Round Top was saved to the Union army, but the cost was appalling.The hill was covered with hundreds of the slain.Scores of the Confederate
sharpshooters had taken position among the crevasses in the Devil's Den,
where they could overlook the position on Little Round Top, and their
unerring aim spread death among the Federal officers and gunners.Colonel
O'Rourke and General Vincent were dead.General Weed was dying; and, as
Hazlett was stooping to receive Weed's last message, a sharpshooter's
bullet laid him--dead--across the body of his chief.During this attack, and for some hours thereafter, the battle continued in
the valley below on a grander scale and with demon-like fury.Sickles' whole line was pressed back to the base
of the hill from which it had advanced in the morning.Sickles' leg was
shattered by a shell, necessitating amputation, while scores of his brave
officers, and thousands of his men, lay on the field of battle when the
struggle ceased at nightfall.This valley has been appropriately named the
"Valley of Death."Before the close of this main part of the second day's battle, there was
another clash of arms, fierce but of short duration, at the other extreme
of the line.Lee had ordered Ewell to attack Cemetery Hill and Culp's Hill
on the north, held by Slocum, who had been weakened by the sending of a
large portion of the Twelfth Corps to the assistance of the left wing.Ewell had three divisions, two of which were commanded by Generals Early
and Johnson.It was nearly sunset when he sent Early to attack Cemetery
Hill.Early was repulsed after an hour's bloody and desperate hand-to-hand
fight, in which muskets and bayonets, rammers, clubs, and stones were
used.Johnson's attack on Culp's Hill was more successful.After a severe
struggle of two or three hours General Greene, who alone of the Twelfth
Corps remained on the right, succeeded, after reenforcement, in driving
the right of Johnson's division away from its entrenchments, but the left
had no difficulty in taking possession of the abandoned works of Geary and
Ruger, now gone to Round Top and Rock Creek to assist the left wing.Thus closed the second day's battle at Gettysburg.The harvest of death
had been frightful.The Union loss during the two days had exceeded twenty
thousand men; the Confederate loss was nearly equal.The Confederate army
had gained an apparent advantage in penetrating the Union breastworks on
Culp's Hill.But the Union lines, except on Culp's Hill, were unbroken.On
the night of July 2d, Lee and his generals held a council of war and
decided to make a grand final assault on Meade's center the following day.His counsel was that
Lee withdraw to the mountains, compel Meade to follow, and then turn and
attack him.But Lee was encouraged by the arrival of Pickett's division
and of Stuart's cavalry, and Longstreet's objections were overruled.Meade
and his corps commanders had met and made a like decision--that there
should be a fight to the death at Gettysburg.That night a brilliant July moon shed its luster upon the ghastly field on
which thousands of men lay, unable to rise.Their last battle was over, and their spirits had fled to the great
Beyond.But there were great numbers, torn and gashed with shot and shell,
who were still alive and calling for water or for the kindly touch of a
helping hand.Here and there in the
moonlight little rescuing parties were seeking out whom they might succor.They carried many to the improvised hospitals, where the surgeons worked
unceasingly and heroically, and many lives were saved.All through the night the Confederates were massing artillery along the
crest of Seminary Ridge.The sound horses were carefully fed and watered,
while those killed or disabled were replaced by others.The ammunition was
replenished and the guns were placed in favorable positions and made ready
for their work of destruction.On the other side, the Federals were diligently laboring in the moonlight,
and ere the coming of the day they had planted batteries on the brow of
the hill above the town as far as Little Round Top.The coming of the
morning revealed the two parallel lines of cannon, a mile apart, which
signified only too well the story of what the day would bring forth.The people of Gettysburg, which lay almost between the armies, were
awakened on that fateful morning--July 3, 1863--by the roar of artillery
from Culp's Hill, around the bend toward Rock Creek.This knoll in the
woods had, as we have seen, been taken by Johnson's men the night before.When Geary and Ruger returned and found their entrenchments occupied by
the Confederates they determined to recapture them in the morning, and
began firing their guns at daybreak.Seven hours of fierce bombardment and
daring charges were required to regain them.Every rod of space was
disputed at the cost of many a brave man's life.At eleven o'clock this
portion of the Twelfth Corps was again in its old position.But the most desperate onset of the three days' battle was yet to
come--Pickett's charge on Cemetery Ridge--preceded by the heaviest
cannonading ever heard on the American continent.With the exception of the contest at Culp's Hill and a cavalry fight east
of Rock Creek, the forenoon of July 3d passed with only an occasional
exchange of shots at irregular intervals.At noon there was a lull, almost
a deep silence, over the whole field.It was the ominous calm that
precedes the storm.At one o'clock signal guns were fired on Seminary
Ridge, and a few moments later there was a terrific outburst from one
hundred and fifty Confederate guns, and the whole crest of the ridge, for
two miles, was a line of flame.The scores of batteries were soon enveloped in smoke, through which the
flashes of burning powder were incessant.The long line of Federal guns withheld their fire for some minutes, when
they burst forth, answering the thunder of those on the opposite hill.An
eye-witness declares that the whole sky seemed filled with screaming
shells, whose sharp explosions, as they burst in mid-air, with the
hurtling of the fragments, formed a running accompaniment to the deep,
tremendous roar of the guns.Many of the Confederate shots went wild, passing over the Union army and
plowing up the earth on the other side of Cemetery Ridge.But others were
better aimed and burst among the Federal batteries, in one of which
twenty-seven out of thirty-six horses were killed in ten minutes.The
Confederate fire seemed to be concentrated upon one point between Cemetery
Ridge and Little Round Top, near a clump of scrub oaks.Here the batteries
were demolished and men and horses were slain by scores.The spot has been
called "Bloody Angle."The Federal fire proved equally accurate and the destruction on Seminary
Ridge was appalling.For nearly two hours the hills shook with the
tremendous cannonading, when it gradually slackened and ceased.The Union
army now prepared for the more deadly charge of infantry which it felt was
sure to follow.As the cannon smoke drifted away from between
the lines fifteen thousand of Longstreet's corps emerged in grand columns
from the wooded crest of Seminary Ridge under the command of General
Pickett on the right and General Pettigrew on the left.Longstreet had
planned the attack with a view to passing around Round Top, and gaining it
by flank and reverse attack, but Lee, when he came upon the scene a few
moments after the final orders had been given, directed the advance to be
made straight toward the Federal main position on Cemetery Ridge.The charge was one of the most daring in warfare.The distance to the
Federal lines was a mile.For half the distance the troops marched gayly,
with flying banners and glittering bayonets.Then came the burst of
Federal cannon, and the Confederate ranks were torn with exploding shells.Pettigrew's columns began to waver, but the lines re-formed and marched
on.When they came within musket-range, Hancock's infantry opened a
terrific fire, but the valiant band only quickened its pace and returned
the fire with volley after volley.Pettigrew's troops succumbed to the
storm.For now the lines in blue were fast converging.Federal troops from
all parts of the line now rushed to the aid of those in front of Pickett.The batteries which had been sending shell and solid shot changed their
ammunition, and double charges of grape and canister were hurled into the
column as it bravely pressed into the sea of flame.The Confederates came
close to the Federal lines and paused to close their ranks.Each moment
the fury of the storm from the Federal guns increased."Forward," again rang the command along the line of the Confederate front,
and the Southerners dashed on.The first line of the Federals was driven
back.A stone wall behind them gave protection to the next Federal force.Riflemen rose from behind and hurled a
death-dealing volley into the Confederate ranks.A defiant cheer answered
the volley, and the Southerners placed their battle-flags on the ramparts.General Armistead grasped the flag from the hand of a falling bearer, and
leaped upon the wall, waving it in triumph.Almost instantly he fell
among the Federal troops, mortally wounded.General Garnett, leading his
brigade, fell dead close to the Federal line.General Kemper sank,
wounded, into the arms of one of his men.Troops from all directions rushed upon
him.Clubbed muskets and barrel-staves now became weapons of warfare.The
Confederates began surrendering in masses and Pickett ordered a retreat.Yet the energy of the indomitable Confederates was not spent.Several
supporting brigades moved forward, and only succumbed when they
encountered two regiments of Stannard's Vermont brigade, and the fire of
fresh batteries.As the remnant of the gallant division returned to the works on Seminary
Ridge General Lee rode out to meet them.His
features gave no evidence of his disappointment.With hat in hand he
greeted the men sympathetically."It was all my fault," he said."Now help
me to save that which remains."The
losses of the two armies reached fifty thousand, about half on either
side.More than seven thousand men had fallen dead on the field of battle.The tide could rise no higher; from this point the ebb must begin.Not
only here, but in the West the Southern cause took a downward turn; for at
this very hour of Pickett's charge, Grant and Pemberton, a thousand miles
away, stood under an oak tree on the heights above the Mississippi and
arranged for the surrender of Vicksburg.Lee could do nothing but lead his army back to Virginia.The Federals
pursued but feebly.The Union victory was not a very decisive one, but,
supported as it was by the fall of Vicksburg, the moral effect on the
nation and on the world was great.It
required but little prophetic vision to foresee that the Republic would
survive the dreadful shock of arms.[Illustration: THE CRISIS BRINGS FORTH THE MAN

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Major-General George Gordon Meade and Staff.Not men, but a man is what
counts in war, said Napoleon; and Lee had proved it true in many a bitter
lesson administered to the Army of the Potomac.At the end of June, 1863,
for the third time in ten months, that army had a new commander.Promptness and caution were equally imperative in that hour.Meade's
fitness for the post was as yet undemonstrated; he had been advanced from
the command of the Fifth Corps three days before the army was to engage in
its greatest battle.Lee must be turned back from Harrisburg and
Philadelphia and kept from striking at Baltimore and Washington, and the
somewhat scattered Army of the Potomac must be concentrated.In the very
first flush of his advancement, Meade exemplified the qualities of sound
generalship that placed his name high on the list of Federal commanders.[Illustration: ROBERT E. LEE IN 1863

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]It was with the gravest misgivings that Lee began his invasion of the
North in 1863.He was too wise a general not to realize that a crushing
defeat was possible.Yet, with Vicksburg already doomed, the effort to win
a decisive victory in the East was imperative in its importance.Magnificent was the courage and fortitude of Lee's maneuvering during that
long march which was to end in failure.Hitherto he had made every one of
his veterans count for two of their antagonists, but at Gettysburg the
odds had fallen heavily against him.Jackson, his resourceful ally, was no
more.Longstreet advised strongly against giving battle, but Lee
unwaveringly made the tragic effort which sacrificed more than a third of
his splendid army.[Illustration: HANCOCK, "THE SUPERB"

1st a foam-flecked charger dashed up Cemetery Hill bearing General
Hancock.He had galloped thirteen miles to take command.Apprised of the
loss of Reynolds, his main dependence, Meade knew that only a man of vigor
and judgment could save the situation.He chose wisely, for Hancock was
one of the best all-round soldiers that the Army of the Potomac had
developed.It was he who re-formed the shattered corps and chose the
position to be held for the decisive struggle.[Illustration: MUTE PLEADERS IN THE CAUSE OF PEACE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, BY PATRIOT PUB.There was little time that could be employed by either side in caring for
those who fell upon the fields of the almost uninterrupted fighting at
Gettysburg.On the morning of the 4th, when Lee began to abandon his
position on Seminary Ridge, opposite the Federal right, both sides sent
forth ambulance and burial details to remove the wounded and bury the dead
in the torrential rain then falling.Under cover of the hazy atmosphere,
Lee was getting his whole army in motion to retreat.Many an unfinished
shallow grave, like the one above, had to be left by the Confederates.In
this lower picture some men of the Twenty-fourth Michigan infantry are
lying dead on the field of battle.This regiment--one of the units of the
Iron Brigade--left seven distinct rows of dead as it fell back from
battle-line to battle-line, on the first day.Three-fourths of its members
were struck down.[Illustration: MEN OF THE IRON BRIGADE]


[Illustration: THE FIRST DAY'S TOLL

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The lives laid down by the blue-clad soldiers in the first day's fighting
made possible the ultimate victory at Gettysburg.The stubborn resistance
of Buford's cavalry and of the First and Eleventh Corps checked the
Confederate advance for an entire day.The delay was priceless; it enabled
Meade to concentrate his army upon the heights to the south of Gettysburg,
a position which proved impregnable.To a Pennsylvanian, General John F.
Reynolds, falls the credit of the determined stand that was made that day.Commanding the advance of the army, he promptly went to Buford's support,
bringing up his infantry and artillery to hold back the Confederates.[Illustration: McPHERSON'S WOODS]

At the edge of these woods General Reynolds was killed by a Confederate
sharpshooter in the first vigorous contest of the day.The woods lay
between the two roads upon which the Confederates were advancing from the
west, and General Doubleday (in command of the First Corps) was ordered to
take the position so that the columns of the foe could be enfiladed by the
infantry, while contending with the artillery posted on both roads.The
Iron Brigade under General Meredith was ordered to hold the ground at all
hazards.As they charged, the troops shouted: "If we can't hold it, where
will you find the men who can?"On they swept, capturing General Archer
and many of his Confederate brigade that had entered the woods from the
other side.As Archer passed to the rear, Doubleday, who had been his
classmate at West Point, greeted him with "Good morning![Illustration: FEDERAL DEAD AT GETTYSBURG, JULY 1, 1863

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.All the way from McPherson's Woods back to Cemetery Hill lay the Federal
soldiers, who had contested every foot of that retreat until nightfall.The Confederates were massing so rapidly from the west and north that
there was scant time to bring off the wounded and none for attention to
the dead.There on the field lay the shoes so much needed by the
Confederates, and the grim task of gathering them began.The dead were
stripped of arms, ammunition, caps, and accoutrements as well--in fact, of
everything that would be of the slightest use in enabling Lee's poorly
equipped army to continue the internecine strife.It was one of war's
awful expedients.[Illustration: SEMINARY RIDGE, BEYOND GETTYSBURG]

Along this road the Federals retreated toward Cemetery Hill in the late
afternoon of July 1st.The success of McPherson's Woods was but temporary,
for the Confederates under Hill were coming up in overpowering numbers,
and now Ewell's forces appeared from the north.The first Corps, under
Doubleday, "broken and defeated but not dismayed," fell back, pausing now
and again to fire a volley at the pursuing Confederates.It finally joined
the Eleventh Corps, which had also been driven back to Cemetery Hill.Lee
was on the field in time to watch the retreat of the Federals, and advised
Ewell to follow them up, but Ewell (who had lost 3,000 men) decided upon
discretion.Night fell with the beaten Federals, reinforced by the Twelfth
Corps and part of the Third, facing nearly the whole of Lee's army.[Illustration: IN THE DEVIL'S DEN

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Upon this wide, steep hill, about five hundred yards due west of Little
Round Top and one hundred feet lower, was a chasm named by the country
folk "the Devil's Den."When the position fell into the hands of the
Confederates at the end of the second day's fighting, it became the
stronghold of their sharpshooters, and well did it fulfill its name.It
was a most dangerous post to occupy, since the Federal batteries on the
Round Top were constantly shelling it in an effort to dislodge the hardy
riflemen, many of whom met the fate of the one in the picture.Their
deadly work continued, however, and many a gallant officer of the Federals
was picked off during the fighting on the afternoon of the second day.General Vincent was one of the first victims; General Weed fell likewise;
and as Lieutenant Hazlett bent over him to catch his last words, a bullet
through the head prostrated that officer lifeless on the body of his
chief.[Illustration: THE UNGUARDED LINK

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Little Round Top, the key to the Federal left at Gettysburg, which they
all but lost on the second day--was the scene of hand-to-hand fighting
rarely equaled since long-range weapons were invented.Twice the
Confederates in fierce conflict fought their way near to this summit, but
were repulsed.Had they gained it, they could have planted artillery which
would have enfiladed the left of Meade's line, and Gettysburg might have
been turned into an overwhelming defeat.Beginning at the right, the
Federal line stretched in the form of a fish-hook, with the barb resting
on Culp's Hill, the center at the bend in the hook on Cemetery Hill, and
the left (consisting of General Sickles' Third Corps) forming the shank to
the southward as far as Round Top.On his own responsibility Sickles had
advanced a portion of his line, leaving Little Round Top unprotected.Upon
this advanced line of Sickles, at the Peach Orchard on the Emmitsburg
road, the Confederates fell in an effort to turn what they supposed to be
Meade's left flank.Only the promptness of General Warren, who discovered
the gap and remedied it in time, saved the key.[Illustration: THE HEIGHT OF THE BATTLE-TIDE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Near this gate to the local cemetery of Gettysburg there stood during the
battle this sign: "All persons found using firearms in these grounds will
be prosecuted with the utmost rigor of the law."Many a soldier must have
smiled grimly at these words, for this gateway became the key of the
Federal line, the very center of the cruelest use of firearms yet seen on
this continent.On the first day Reynolds saw the value of Cemetery Hill
in case of a retreat.Howard posted his reserves here, and Hancock greatly
strengthened the position.One hundred and fifty Confederate guns were
turned against it that last afternoon.In five minutes every man of the
Federals had been forced to cover; for an hour and a half the shells fell
fast, dealing death and laying waste the summer verdure in the little
graveyard.Up to the very guns of the Federals on Cemetery Hill, Pickett
led his devoted troops.At night of the 3d it was one vast
slaughter-field.On this eminence, where thousands were buried, was
dedicated the soldiers' National Cemetery.[Illustration: PICKETT--THE MARSHALL NEY OF GETTYSBURG]

The Now-or-never Charge of Pickett's Men.When the Confederate artillery
opened at one o'clock on the afternoon of July 3d, Meade and his staff
were driven from their headquarters on Cemetery Ridge.Nothing could live
exposed on that hillside, swept by cannon that were being worked as fast
as human hands could work them.It was the beginning of Lee's last effort
to wrest victory from the odds that were against him.Longstreet, on the
morning of the 3d, had earnestly advised against renewing the battle
against the Gettysburg heights.But Lee saw that in this moment the fate
of the South hung in the balance; that if the Army of Northern Virginia
did not win, it would never again become the aggressor.Pickett's
division, as yet not engaged, was the force Lee designated for the
assault; every man was a Virginian, forming a veritable Tenth Legion in
valor.Auxiliary divisions swelled the charging column to 15,000.In the
middle of the afternoon the Federal guns ceased firing.Twice Pickett asked of Longstreet if he should go
forward."Sir, I shall lead my division
forward," said Pickett at last, and the heavy-hearted Longstreet bowed his
head.As the splendid column swept out of the woods and across the plain
the Federal guns reopened with redoubled fury.For a mile Pickett and his
men kept on, facing a deadly greeting of round shot, canister, and the
bullets of Hancock's resolute infantry.It was magnificent--but every one
of Pickett's brigade commanders went down and their men fell by scores and
hundreds around them.A hundred led by Armistead, waving his cap on his
sword-point, actually broke through and captured a battery, Armistead
falling beside a gun.Longstreet had been right
when he said: "There never was a body of fifteen thousand men who could
make that attack successfully."Before the converging Federals the thinned
ranks of Confederates drifted wearily back toward Seminary Ridge.Victory
for the South was not to be.[Illustration: MEADE'S HEADQUARTERS ON CEMETERY RIDGE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: WHERE PICKETT CHARGED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The prelude to Pickett's magnificent charge was a sudden deluge of shells
from 150 long-range Confederate guns trained upon Cemetery Ridge.General
Meade and his staff were instantly driven from their headquarters (already
illustrated) and within five minutes the concentrated artillery fire had
swept every unsheltered position on Cemetery Ridge clear of men.In the
woods, a mile and a half distant, Pickett and his men watched the effect
of the bombardment, expecting the order to "Go Forward" up the <DW72>
(shown in the picture).The Federals had instantly opened with their
eighty available guns, and for three hours the most terrific artillery
duel of the war was kept up.Then the Federal fire slackened, as though
the batteries were silenced.The Confederates' artillery ammunition also
was now low.And at
Longstreet's reluctant nod the commander led his 14,000 Virginians across
the plain in their tragic charge up Cemetery Ridge.[Illustration: GENERAL L. A. ARMISTEAD, C. S.In that historic charge was Armistead, who achieved a momentary victory
and met a hero's death.On across the Emmitsburg road came Pickett's
dauntless brigades, coolly closing up the fearful chasms torn in their
ranks by the canister.Up to the fence held by Hays' brigade dashed the
first gray line, only to be swept into confusion by a cruel enfilading
fire.Then the brigades of Armistead and Garnett moved forward, driving
Hays' brigade back through the batteries on the crest.Despite the
death-dealing bolts on all sides, Pickett determined to capture the guns;
and, at the order, Armistead, leaping the fence and waving his cap on his
sword-point, rushed forward, followed by about a hundred of his men.Up to
the very crest they fought the Federals back, and Armistead, shouting,
"Give them the cold steel, boys!"For a moment the
Confederate flag waved triumphantly over the Federal battery.For a brief
interval the fight raged fiercely at close quarters.Armistead was shot
down beside the gun he had taken, and his men were driven back.Pickett,
as he looked around the top of the ridge he had gained, could see his men
fighting all about with clubbed muskets and even flagstaffs against the
troops that were rushing in upon them from all sides.Flesh and blood
could not hold the heights against such terrible odds, and with a heart
full of anguish Pickett ordered a retreat.The despairing Longstreet,
watching from Seminary Ridge, saw through the smoke the shattered remnants
drift sullenly down the <DW72> and knew that Pickett's glorious but costly
charge was ended.[Illustration: THE MAN WHO HELD THE CENTER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Headquarters of Brigadier-General Alexander S. Webb.It devolved upon the
man pictured here (booted and in full uniform, before his headquarters
tent to the left of the picture) to meet the shock of Pickett's great
charge.With four Pennsylvania regiments (the Sixty-Ninth, Seventy-First,
Seventy-Second, and One Hundred and Sixth) of Hancock's Second Corps, Webb
was equal to the emergency.Stirred to great deeds by the example of a
patriotic ancestry, he felt that upon his holding his position depended
the outcome of the day.His front had been the focus of the Confederate
artillery fire.Batteries to right and left of his line were practically
silenced.Young Lieutenant Cushing, mortally wounded, fired the last
serviceable gun and fell dead as Pickett's men came on.Cowan's First New
York Battery on the left of Cushing's used canister on the assailants at
less than ten yards.Webb at the head of the Seventy-Second Pennsylvania
fought back the on-rush, posting a line of slightly wounded in his rear.Webb himself fell wounded but his command checked the assault till Hall's
brilliant charge turned the tide at this point.[Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE ARMSTRONG CUSTER WITH GENERAL

Point in 1861.As captain of volunteers he served with McClellan on the
Peninsula.In June, 1863, he was made brigadier-general of volunteers and
as the head of a brigade of cavalry distinguished himself at Gettysburg.Later he served with Sheridan in the Shenandoah, won honor at Cedar Creek,
and was brevetted major-general of volunteers on October 19, 1864.Under
Sheridan he participated in the battles of Five Forks, Dinwiddie Court
House, and other important cavalry engagements of Grant's last campaign.[Illustration: SUMTER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Searching all history for a parallel, it is impossible to find any
defenses of a beleaguered city that stood so severe a bombardment as did
this bravely defended and never conquered fortress of Sumter, in
Charleston Harbor.It is estimated that about eighty thousand projectiles
were discharged from the fleet and the marsh batteries, and yet
Charleston, with its battered water-front, was not abandoned until all
other Confederate positions along the Atlantic Coast were in Federal hands
and Sherman's triumphant army was sweeping in from the West and South.The
picture shows Sumter from the Confederate Fort Johnson.The powerful
batteries in the foreground played havoc with the Federal fleet whenever
it came down the main ship-channel to engage the forts.Protected by
almost impassable swamps, morasses, and a network of creeks to the
eastward, Fort Johnson held an almost impregnable position; and from its
protection by Cummings' Point, on which was Battery Gregg, the Federal
fleet could not approach nearer than two miles.Could it have been taken
by land assault or reduced by gun-fire, Charleston would have fallen.[Illustration: WHERE SHOT AND SHELL STRUCK SUMTER]

These views show the result of the bombardment from August 17 to 23, 1863.The object was to force the surrender of the fort and thus effect an
entrance into Charleston.The report of Colonel John W. Turner, Federal
chief of artillery runs: "The fire from the breaching batteries upon
Sumter was incessant, and kept up continuously from daylight till dark,
until the evening of the 23d.... The fire upon the gorge had, by the
morning of the 23d, succeeded in destroying every gun upon the parapet of
it.The parapet and ramparts of the gorge were completely demolished for
nearly the entire length of the face, and in places everything was swept
off down to the arches, the _debris_ forming an accessible ramp to the top
of the ruins.Nothing further being gained by a longer fire upon this
face, all the guns were directed this day upon the southeasterly flank,
and continued an incessant fire throughout the day.The demolition of the
fort at the close of the day's firing was complete, so far as its
offensive powers were considered."[Illustration: SOME OF THE 450 SHOT A DAY]

maximum charge of powder of 25 pounds.The gun was fractured at the
twenty-seventh round by a shell bursting in the muzzle, blowing off about
20 inches of the barrel.After the bursting the gun was "chipped" back
beyond the termination of the fracture and afterwards fired 371 rounds
with as good results as before the injury.At the end of that time the
muzzle began to crack again, rendering the gun entirely useless.[Illustration: TWO PARROTTS IN BATTERY STEVENS

batteries "on the left," as they were designated, were pounding away at
Fort Sumter.[Illustration: IN CHARLESTON AFTER THE BOMBARDMENT

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.So long as the Confederate flag flew over the ramparts of Sumter,
Charleston remained the one stronghold of the South that was firmly held.It was lowered for an evacuation, not a
surrender.The story of Charleston's determined resistance did not end in
triumph for the South, but it did leave behind it a sunset glory, in which
the valor and dash of the Federal attack is paralleled by the heroism and
self-sacrifice of the Confederate defense, in spite of wreck and ruin.[Illustration: SCENE OF THE NIGHT ATTACK ON SUMTER, SEPTEMBER 8, 1863]

The lower picture was taken after the war, when relic-hunters had removed
the shells, and a beacon light had been erected where once stood the
parapet.On September 8, 1863, at the very position in these photographs,
the garrison repelled a bold assault with musketry fire alone, causing the
Federals severe loss.The flag of the Confederacy floated triumphantly
over the position during the whole of the long struggle.Every effort of
the Federals to reduce the crumbling ruins into submission was unavailing.It stood the continual bombardment of ironclads until it was nothing but a
mass of brickdust, but still the gallant garrison held it.It is strange
that despite the awful destruction the loss of lives within the fort was
few.For weeks the bombardment, assisted by the guns of the fleet, tore
great chasms in the parapet.Fort Sumter never fell, but was abandoned
only on the approach of Sherman's army.It had withstood continuous
efforts against it for 587 days.From April, 1863, to September of the
same year, the fortress was garrisoned by the First South Carolina
Artillery, enlisted as regulars.Afterward the garrison was made up of
detachments of infantry from Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.Artillerists also served turns of duty during this period.[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.][Illustration: RALLYING THE LINE._Painted by C. D. Graves._

CHICKAMAUGA--THE BLOODIEST CONFLICT IN THE WEST

    In its dimensions and its murderousness the battle of Chickamauga was
    the greatest battle fought by our Western armies, and one of the
    greatest of modern times.In our Civil War it was exceeded only by
    Gettysburg and the Wilderness; in European history we may compare with
    it such battles as Neerwinden, or Malplaquet, or Waterloo.--_John
    Fiske in "The Mississippi Valley in the Civil War."_


The town of Chattanooga, Tennessee, lies in a great bend of the Tennessee
River and within a vast amphitheater of mountains, ranging in a general
southwesterly direction, and traversed at intervals by great depressions
or valleys.These passes form a natural gateway from the mid-Mississippi
valley to the seaboard States.To dislodge the Confederate army under
General Bragg from this natural fortress would remove the last barrier to
the invading Federals, and permit an easy entry upon the plains of
Georgia.The importance of this position was readily apparent to the
Confederate Government, and any approach by the Federal forces toward this
point was almost certain to be met by stubborn resistance.Rosecrans' forward movement from Murfreesboro, in the early summer of
1863, forced Bragg over the Cumberland Mountains and across the Tennessee.The Confederate leader destroyed the railroad bridge at Bridgeport and
entrenched himself in and around Chattanooga.The three Federal corps
under Crittenden, Thomas and McCook crossed the Tennessee without meeting
resistance, and began to endanger Bragg's lines of communication.But on
September 8th, before their moves had been accomplished, Bragg abandoned
his stronghold.Crittenden the next day marched around the north end of
Lookout and entered the town, while Hazen and Wagner crossed over from the
opposite bank of the Tennessee.Rosecrans believed that Bragg was in full retreat toward Rome, Georgia,
and Crittenden, leaving one brigade in Chattanooga, was ordered to pursue.Bragg encouraged his adversary in the belief that he was avoiding an
engagement and sent spies as deserters into the Federal ranks to narrate
the details of his flight.Meanwhile, he was concentrating at Lafayette,
about twenty-five miles south of Chattanooga.Hither General S. B.
Buckner, entirely too weak to cope with Burnside's heavy column
approaching from Kentucky, brought his troops from Knoxville.Breckinridge
and two brigades arrived from Mississippi, while twelve thousand of Lee's
veterans, under Lee's most trusted and illustrious lieutenant, Longstreet,
were hastening from Virginia to add their numbers to Bragg's Army of
Tennessee.The three corps of the Union army, as we have seen, were now separated
over a wide extent of territory by intervening ridges, so intent was
Rosecrans on intercepting the vanished Bragg.But the latter, by no means
vanished, and with his face toward Chattanooga, considered the position of
his antagonist and discovered his own army almost opposite the Federal
center.Crittenden was advancing toward Ringgold, and the remoteness of
Thomas' corps on his right precluded any immediate union of the Federal
forces.Bragg was quick to grasp the opportunity made by Rosecrans' division of
the army in the face of his opponent.He at once perceived the
possibilities of a master-stroke; to crush Thomas' advanced divisions with
an overwhelming force.The attempt failed, owing to a delay in the attack, which permitted the
endangered Baird and Negley to fall back.Bragg then resolved to throw
himself upon Crittenden, who had divided his corps.Polk was ordered to
advance upon that portion of it at Lee and Gordon's Mills, but when Bragg
came to the front September 13th, expecting to witness the annihilation
of the Twenty-first Corps, he found to his bitter disappointment that the
bishop-general had made no move and that Crittenden had reunited his
divisions and was safe on the west bank of the Chickamauga.Thus his
splendid chances of breaking up the Army of the Cumberland were ruined.When Bragg's position became known to Rosecrans, great was his haste to
effect the concentration of his army.Couriers dashed toward Alpine with
orders for McCook to join Thomas with the utmost celerity.The former
started at once, shortly after midnight on the 13th, in response to
Thomas's urgent call.It was a real race of life and death, attended by
the greatest hardships.Ignorant of the roads, McCook submitted his troops
to a most exhausting march, twice up and down the mountain, fifty-seven
miles of the most arduous toil, often dragging artillery up by hand and
letting it down steep declines by means of ropes.But he closed up with
Thomas on the 17th, and the Army of the Cumberland was saved from its
desperate peril.Crittenden's corps now took position at Lee and Gordon's Mills on the left
bank of Chickamauga Creek, and the Federal troops were all within
supporting distance.In the Indian tongue Chickamauga means "The River of
Death," a name strangely prophetic of that gigantic conflict soon to be
waged by these hostile forces throughout this beautiful and heretofore
peaceful valley.The Confederate army, its corps under Generals Polk, D. H. Hill, and
Buckner, was stationed on the east side of the stream, its right wing
below Lee and Gordon's Mills, and the left extending up the creek toward
Lafayette.On the Federal side Thomas was moved to the left, with
Crittenden in the center and McCook on the right.Their strength has been
estimated at fifty-five to sixty-nine thousand men.On the 18th,
Longstreet's troops were arriving from Virginia, and by the morning of the
19th the greater part of the Confederate army had crossed the
Chickamauga.The two mighty armies were now face to face, and none could
doubt that the impending struggle would be attended by frightful loss to
both sides.It was Bragg's intention to send Polk, commanding the right wing, in a
flanking movement against the Federal left under Thomas, and thus
intervene between it and Chattanooga.The first encounter, at 10 o'clock
in the morning of the 19th, resulted in a Confederate repulse, but fresh
divisions were constantly pushed forward under the deadly fire of the
Federal artillery.The Federals were gradually forced back by the
incessant charge of the Confederates; but assailed and assailant fought
with such great courage and determination that any decided advantage was
withheld from either.Meanwhile, the Federal right was hard pressed by
Hood, commanding Longstreet's corps, and a desperate battle ensued along
the entire line.It seemed, however, more like a struggle between separate
divisions than the clash of two great armies.When night descended the
Federals had been forced back from the creek, but the result had been
indecisive.Disaster to the Union army had been averted by the use of powerful
artillery when the infantry seemed unable to withstand the onslaught.Rosecrans had assumed the defensive, and his troops had so far receded as
to enable the Confederates to form their lines on all the territory fought
over on that day.During the night preparations were made in both camps
for a renewal of the battle on the following morning, which was Sunday.A
fresh disposition of the troops was made by both leaders.Near midnight
General Longstreet arrived on the field, and was once placed in command of
the Confederate left, Polk retaining the right.Not all of Longstreet's
troops arrived in time for the battle, but Bragg's force has been
estimated at fifty-one to seventy-one thousand strong.Thomas was given command of the Union left, with McCook at his right,
while Crittenden's forces occupied the center, but to the rear of both
Thomas and McCook.Thomas had spent the night in throwing up breastworks
on the brow of Snodgrass Hill, as it was anticipated that the Confederates
would concentrate their attack upon his position.Hostilities began with a general movement of the Confederate right wing in
an attempt to flank the Union left.General Bragg had ordered Polk to
begin the attack at daybreak, but it was nearly ten o'clock in the morning
before Breckinridge's division, supported by General Cleburne, advanced
upon Thomas' entrenchments.Fighting desperately, the Confederates did not
falter under the heavy fire of the Federals, and it seemed as if the
latter must be driven from their position.Rosecrans, in response to
urgent requests for reenforcements, despatched troops again and again to
the aid of Thomas, and the assault was finally repulsed.Cleburne's
division was driven back with heavy loss, and Breckinridge, unable to
retain any advantage, was forced to defend his right, which was being
seriously menaced.The battle at this point had been desperately waged,
both sides exhibiting marked courage and determination.As on the previous
day, the Confederates had been the aggressors, but the Federal troops had
resisted all attempts to invade their breastworks.However, the fortunes of battle were soon to incline to the side of the
Southern army.Bragg sent Stewart's division forward, and it pressed
Reynolds' and Brannan's men back to their entrenchments.Rosecrans sent
Wood word to close up on Reynolds.Through some misunderstanding in giving
or interpreting this order, General Wood withdrew his division from its
position on the right of Brannan.By this movement a large opening was
left almost in the center of the battle-line.Johnson's, Hindman's, and
Kershaw's divisions rushed into the gap and fell upon the Union right and
center with an impetus that was irresistible.The Confederate general,
Bushrod Johnson, has given us an unforgetable picture of the thrilling
event: "The resolute and impetuous charge, the rush of our heavy columns
sweeping out from the shadow and gloom of the forest into the open fields
flooded with sunlight, the glitter of arms, the onward dash of artillery
and mounted men, the retreat of the foe, the shouts of the hosts of our
army, the dust, the smoke, the noise of fire-arms--of whistling balls, and
grape-shot, and of bursting shell--made up a battle-scene of unsurpassed
grandeur.Here, General Hood gave me the last order I received from him on
the field, 'Go ahead and keep ahead of everything.'"A moment later, and
Hood fell, severely wounded, with a minie ball in his thigh.Wood's right brigade was shattered even before it had cleared the opening.Sheridan's entire division, and part of Davis' and Van Cleve's, were
driven from the field.Longstreet now gave a fine exhibition of his
military genius.The orders of battle were to separate the two wings of
the opposing army.But with the right wing of his opponents in hopeless
ruin, he wheeled to the right and compelled the further withdrawal of
Federal troops in order to escape being surrounded.The brave
soldier-poet, William H. Lytle, fell at the head of his brigade as he
strove to re-form his line.McCook and Crittenden were unable, in spite of
several gallant efforts, to rally their troops and keep back the onrushing
heroes of Stone's River and Bull Run.The broken mass fled in confusion
toward Chattanooga, carrying with it McCook, Crittenden, and Rosecrans.The latter telegraphed to Washington that his army had been beaten.In
this famous charge the Confederates took several thousand prisoners and
forty pieces of artillery.Flushed with victory, the Confederates now concentrated their attack upon
Thomas, who thus far, on Horseshoe Ridge and its spurs, had repelled all
attempts to dislodge him.The Confederates, with victory within their
grasp, and led by the indomitable Longstreet, swarmed up the <DW72>s in
great numbers, but they were hurled back with fearful slaughter.Thomas
was looking anxiously for Sheridan, whom, as he knew, Rosecrans had
ordered with two brigades to his support.But in Longstreet's rout of the
right wing Sheridan, with the rest, had been carried on toward
Chattanooga, and he found himself completely cut off from Thomas, as the
Confederates were moving parallel to him.Yet the indomitable Sheridan, in
spite of his terrible experience of the morning, did not give up the
attempt.Foiled in his efforts to get through McFarland's Gap, he moved
quickly on Rossville and came down the Lafayette road toward Thomas' left
flank.Meanwhile, advised by the incessant roar of musketry, General Gordon
Granger, in command of the reserve corps near Rossville, advanced rapidly
with his fresh troops.Acting with promptness and alacrity under orders,
Granger sent Steedman to Thomas' right.Directly across the line of Thomas' right was a ridge, on which Longstreet
stationed Hindman with a large command, ready for an attack on Thomas'
flank--a further and terrible menace to the nearly exhausted general, but
it was not all.In the ridge was a small gap, and through this Kershaw was
pouring his division, intent on getting to Thomas' rear.Rosecrans thus
describes the help afforded to Thomas: "Steedman, taking a regimental
color, led the column.Swift was the charge and terrible the conflict, but
the enemy was broken."The fighting grew fiercer, and at intervals was almost hand to hand.The
casualties among the officers, who frequently led their troops in person,
were mounting higher and higher as the moments passed.All the afternoon
the assaults continued, but the Union forces stood their ground.Ammunition ran dangerously low, but Steedman had brought a small supply,
and when this was distributed each man had about ten rounds.Finally, as
the sun was setting in the west, the Confederate troops advanced in a
mighty concourse.The combined forces of Kershaw, Law, Preston, and
Hindman once more rushed forward, gained possession of their lost ridge at
several points, but were unable to drive their attack home.In many places
the Union lines stood firm and both sides rested in the positions taken.The onslaught on the Federal left of the
battlefield was one of the heaviest attacks made on a single point during
the war.History records no grander spectacle than Thomas' stand at Chickamauga.He
was ever afterwards known as "The Rock of Chickamauga."Under the cover of
darkness, Thomas, having received word from Rosecrans to withdraw, retired
his army in good order to Rossville, and on the following day rejoined
Rosecrans in Chattanooga.The battle of Chickamauga, considering the
forces engaged, was one of the most destructive of the Civil War.The
Union army lost approximately sixteen thousand men, and while the loss to
the Confederate army is not definitely known, it was probably nearly
eighteen thousand.The personal daring and tenacious courage displayed in
the ranks of both armies have never been excelled on any battlefield.The
Confederate generals, Helm, Deshler, and Preston Smith were killed; Adams,
Hood, Brown, Gregg, Clayton, Hindman, and McNair were wounded.The battle is generally considered a Confederate victory,
and yet, aside from the terrible loss of human life, no distinct advantage
accrued to either side.The Federal army retained possession of
Chattanooga, but the Confederates had for the time checked the Army of the
Cumberland from a further occupation of Southern soil.It is a singular coincidence that the generals-in-chief of both armies
exercised but little supervision over the movements of their respective
troops.The brunt of the battle fell, for the most part, upon the
commanders of the wings.To the subordinate generals on each side were
awarded the highest honors.Longstreet, because of his eventful charge,
which swept the right wing of the Union army from the field, was
proclaimed the victor of Chickamauga; and to General Thomas, who by his
firmness and courage withstood the combined attack of the Confederate
forces when disaster threatened on every side, is due the brightest
laurels from the adherents of the North.[Illustration: THE CONFEDERATE LEADER AT CHICKAMAUGA

1876.Bragg's name before 1861 was perhaps better known in military annals
than that of any other Southern leader because of his brilliant record in
the Mexican War.In the Civil War he distinguished himself first at Shiloh
and by meritorious services thereafter.But his delays rendered him
scarcely a match for Rosecrans, to say nothing of Grant and Sherman.Flanked out of two strong positions, he missed the opportunity presented
by Rosecrans' widely separated forces and failed to crush the Army of the
Cumberland in detail, as it advanced to the battle of Chickamauga.The
error cost the Confederates the loss of Tennessee, eventually.[Illustration: THOMAS--THE "ROCK OF CHICKAMAUGA" WHO BECAME THE "SLEDGE OF

Union; commended for gallantry in the Seminole War, and for service in
Mexico; won the battle of Mill Spring, January 19, 1862; commanded the
right wing of the Army of the Tennessee against Corinth and at Perryville,
and the center at Stone's River.Only his stability averted overwhelming
defeat for the Federals at Chickamauga.At Lookout Mountain and Missionary
Ridge he was a host in himself.After Sherman had taken Atlanta he sent
Thomas back to Tennessee to grapple with Hood.How he crushed Hood by his
sledge-hammer blows is told in the story of "Nashville."Thomas, sitting
down in Nashville, bearing the brunt of Grant's impatience, and ignoring
completely the proddings from Washington to advance before he was ready,
while he waited grimly for the psychological moment to strike the oncoming
Confederate host under Hood, is one of the really big dramatic figures of
the entire war.It has been well said of Thomas that every promotion he
received was a reward of merit; and that during his long and varied career
as a soldier no crisis ever arose too great for his ability.[Illustration: BEFORE CHICKAMAUGA--IN THE RUSH OF EVENTS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Rarely does the camera afford such a perfectly contemporaneous record of
the march of events so momentous.This photograph shows the hotel at
Stevenson, Alabama, during the Union advance that ended in Chickamauga.Sentinels are parading the street in front of the hotel, several horses
are tied to the hotel posts, and the officers evidently have gone into the
hotel headquarters.General Alexander McDowell McCook, commanding the old
Twentieth Army Corps, took possession of the hotel as temporary
headquarters on the movement of the Army of the Cumberland from Tullahoma.On August 29, 1863, between Stevenson and Caperton's Ferry, on the
Tennessee River, McCook gathered his boats and pontoons, hidden under the
dense foliage of overhanging trees, and when ready for his crossing
suddenly launched them into and across the river.Thence the troops
marched over Sand Mountain and at length into Lookout Valley.During the
movements the army was in extreme peril, for McCook was at one time three
days' march from Thomas, so that Bragg might have annihilated the
divisions in detail.Finally the scattered corps were concentrated along
Chickamauga Creek, where the bloody struggle of September 19th and 20th
was so bravely fought.[Illustration: ON THE WAY TO CHICKAMAUGA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This solitary observer, if he was standing here September 20, 1863,
shortly before this was photographed, certainly gazed at the base of the
hill to the left.For through the pass called Rossville Gap a column in
blue was streaming--Steedman's Division of the Reserve Corps, rushing to
aid Thomas, so sore pressed at Chickamauga.Those <DW72>s by Chickamauga
Creek witnessed the deadliest battle in the West and the highest in
percentage of killed and wounded of the entire war.It was fought as a
result of Rosecrans' attempt to maneuver Bragg out of Chattanooga.The
Federal army crossed the Tennessee River west of the city, passed through
the mountain-ranges, and came upon Bragg's line of communications.Finding
his position untenable, the Southern leader moved southward and fell upon
the united forces of Rosecrans along Chickamauga Creek.The vital point in
the Federal line was the left, held by Thomas.Should that give way, the
army would be cut off from Chattanooga, with no base to fall back on.The
heavy fighting of September 19th showed that Bragg realized the situation.For a time, the Union army was
driven back.But at nightfall Thomas had regained the lost ground.He
re-formed during the night in order to protect the road leading into
Chattanooga.Since the second day was foggy till the middle of the
forenoon, the fighting was not renewed till late.About noon a break was
made in the right of the Federal battle-line, into which the eager
Longstreet promptly hurled his men.Colonel Dodge writes: "Everything
seems lost.The entire right of the army, with Rosecrans and his staff, is
driven from the field in utter rout.But, unknown even to the commanding
general, Thomas, the Rock of Chickamauga, stands there at bay, surrounded,
facing two to one.Heedless of the wreck of one-half the army, he knows
not how to yield."[Illustration: THE TOO-ADVANCED POSITION

in concentrating his troops on the 18th of September, was still possessed
of the idea that Bragg was covering his retreat upon his railroad
connections at Dalton.Instead, the Confederate commander had massed his
forces on the other side of Chickamauga and was only awaiting the arrival
of Longstreet to assume the aggressive.On the morning of the 19th,
McCook's right wing at Crawfish Spring was strongly threatened by the
Confederates, while the real attack was made against the left in an effort
to turn it and cut Rosecrans off from a retreat upon Chattanooga.All day
long, brigade after brigade was marched from the right of the Federal line
in order to extend the left under Thomas and withstand this flanking
movement.Even after nightfall, Thomas, trying to re-form his lines and
carry them still farther to the left for the work of the morrow, brought
on a sharp conflict in the darkness.The Confederates had been held back,
but at heavy cost.That night, at the Widow Glenn's house, Rosecrans
consulted his generals.The exhausted Thomas, when roused from sleep for
his opinion, invariably answered, "I would strengthen the left."There
seemed as yet to be no crisis at hand, and the council closed with a song
by the debonair McCook.[Illustration: WHERE THE LINES WERE SWEPT BACK

Federal line on the second day at Chickamauga.From it, northward, were
posted the commands of McCook and Crittenden, depleted by the detachments
of troops the day before to strengthen the left.All might have gone well
if the main attack of the Confederates had continued to the left, as
Rosecrans expected.But hidden in the woods, almost within a stone's throw
of the Federal right on that misty morning, was the entire corps of
Longstreet, drawn up in columns of brigades at half distance--"a
masterpiece of tactics," giving space for each column to swing right or
left.Seizing a momentous opportunity which would have lasted but thirty
minutes at the most, Longstreet hurled them through a gap which, owing to
a misunderstanding, had been left open, and the entire Federal right was
swept from the field.[Illustration: THE HOUSE WHENCE HELP CAME

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Here, at his headquarters, holding the Federal line of retreat at
Rossville Gap (the Confederate objective in the battle), General Gordon
Granger heard with increasing anxiety the sounds of the conflict, three
miles away, growing more and more ominous.Finally, in disobedience of
orders, he set in motion his three brigades to the relief of Thomas,
pushing forward two of them under Steedman.These arrived upon the field
early in the afternoon, the most critical period of the battle, as
Longstreet charged afresh on Thomas' right and rear.Seizing a
battle-flag, Steedman (at the order of General Granger) led his command in
a counter-charge which saved the Army of the Cumberland.This old house at
Rossville was built by John Ross, a chief of the Cherokee Indians, and he

    which supplied it were exhaustless.It was still coming with an ever
    increasing current, swelling higher and growing more resistless.This
    triune disaster [Vicksburg, Gettysburg, Missionary Ridge] was
    especially depressing to the people because it came like a blight upon
    their hopes which had been awakened by recent Confederate
    victories."--_General John B. Gordon, C. S. A., in "Reminiscences of
    the Civil War."_


Following the defeat of Rosecrans' army at Chickamauga in September 1863
Bragg at once took strong positions on Missionary Ridge and Lookout
Mountain.From these heights he was able to besiege the entire Army of the
Cumberland in Chattanooga and obstruct the main arteries of supply to the
Federal troops.Rosecrans was forced to abandon the route along the south
bank of the Tennessee River, which led from Bridgeport, in Alabama, and to
depend exclusively upon a long and mountainous wagon road on the north
side of the river for the transportation of supplies.The Confederate
cavalry, crossing the Tennessee above Chattanooga, fell upon the trains
entangled in the mud of the Sequatchie valley, destroying in one day three
hundred wagons, and killing or capturing about eighteen hundred mules.Within a short time the wisdom of Bragg's plan became apparent; famine
threatened the Union army and several thousand horses and mules had
already died from starvation.By his relentless vigil, the Confederate
leader seemed destined to achieve a greater victory over his opponent than
had hitherto attended his efforts in actual conflict.Meanwhile, a complete reorganization of the Federal forces in the West was
effected.Under the title of the Military Division of the Mississippi, the
Departments of the Ohio, the Cumberland, and the Tennessee were united
with Grant as general commanding, and Rosecrans was replaced by Thomas at
the head of the Army of the Cumberland.A hurried concentration of the Federal forces was now ordered by General
Halleck.Hooker with fifteen thousand men of the Army of the Potomac came
rapidly by rail to Bridgeport.Sherman, with a portion of his army, about
twenty thousand strong, was summoned from Vicksburg and at once embarked
in steamers for Memphis.General Grant decided to assume personal charge
of the Federal forces; but before he reached his new command, Thomas, ably
assisted by his chief engineer, General W. F. Smith, had begun to act on a
plan which Rosecrans had conceived, and which proved in the end to be a
brilliant conception.This was to seize a low range of hills known as
Raccoon Mountain on the peninsula made by a bend of the river, on its
south side and west of Chattanooga, and establish a wagon road to Kelly's
Ferry, a point farther down the river to which supplies could be brought
by boat from Bridgeport, and at the same time communication effected with
Hooker.A direct line was not only secured to Bridgeport, but Hooker advanced with
a portion of his troops into Lookout Valley and after a short but decisive
skirmish drove the Confederates across Lookout Creek, leaving his forces
in possession of the hills he had gained.The route was now opened between
Bridgeport and Brown's Ferry; abundant supplies were at once available and
the Army of the Cumberland relieved of its perilous position.Unlike the condition which had prevailed at Chickamauga, reenforcements
from all sides were hastening to the aid of Thomas' army; Hooker was
already on the ground; Sherman was advancing rapidly from Memphis, and he
arrived in person on November 15th, while Burnside's forces at Knoxville
offered protection to the left flank of the Federal army.The disposition of the Confederate troops at this time was a formidable
one; the left flank rested on the northern end of Lookout Mountain and the
line extended a distance of twelve miles across Chattanooga Valley to
Missionary Ridge.This position was further strengthened by entrenchments
throughout the lowlands.Despite the danger which threatened his army from
the converging Union forces, General Bragg determined to attack Burnside
and despatched Longstreet with twenty thousand of his best troops to
Knoxville.His army materially weakened, the Confederate general continued
to hold the same extended position, although his combined force was
smaller than had opposed Rosecrans alone at Chickamauga.On the 23d of November, after a long and fatiguing march over roads almost
impassable by reason of continuous rains, Sherman crossed the Tennessee by
the pontoon bridge at Brown's Ferry, recrossed it above Chattanooga, and
was assigned a position to the left of the main army near the mouth of
Chickamauga Creek.Grant had now some eighty thousand men, of whom sixty
thousand were on the scene of the coming battle, and, though fearful lest
Burnside should be dislodged from his position at Knoxville, he would not
be diverted from his purpose of sweeping the Confederates from the front
of Chattanooga.It had been Grant's plan to attack on the 24th, but
information reached him that Bragg was preparing a retreat.He, therefore,
on the 23d, ordered Thomas to advance upon Bragg's center.Preparations for movement were made in full view of the Confederates; from
the appearance of the troops, clad in their best uniforms, the advance
line of the Southern army was content to watch this display, in the belief
that the maneuvering army was parading in review.Suddenly, the peaceful
pageant turned into a furious charge, before which the Confederate
pickets, taken by surprise, retreated from the first line of earthworks,
and Thomas, with little loss to either side, captured Orchard Knob,
between Chattanooga and Missionary Ridge.From this point, which was
almost a mile in advance of the position occupied during the morning,
Grant directed the movements of his army on the following day.The Federal position was of less extent than that occupied by the
Confederates.Sherman was in command of the left wing, while Thomas held
the center, and "Fighting Joe" Hooker, with the Union right in Lookout
Valley, threatened Lookout Mountain.The plan of battle was for Sherman to
engage the Confederate right and sever communications between Bragg and
Longstreet; Hooker was to carry out an assault on the Southern left flank,
and at the same time maintain connection with Bridgeport.With both wings
assailed by a superior force, it was believed that Bragg must reenforce
these positions and permit Thomas, with overwhelming numbers, to
concentrate upon the center.On the 24th, two distinct movements were in progress.Sherman met with but
little opposition in his initial attack upon the Confederate right and
promptly seized and occupied the north end of Missionary Ridge.The
Confederates, late in the afternoon, fought desperately to regain the hill
but were finally repulsed, and Sherman fortified the position he had
gained.In the mean time, Hooker, early in the day, had begun his
operations against Lookout Mountain.Standing like a lone sentinel above
the surrounding valleys, its steep, rocky, and deeply furrowed <DW72>s,
rising into a high, palisaded crest, frowned defiance upon the advancing
troops, while a well-constructed line of defenses completed the imposing
barrier.Hooker had in addition to his own troops a division of Sherman's army
(Osterhaus') which, owing to damage to the pontoon bridge at Brown's
Ferry, had been prevented from joining its own leader.As ordered by
Hooker, General Geary took his division up the valley to Wauhatchie,
crossed the creek and marched down the east bank, sweeping the
Confederate outposts before him.The remainder of the command got across
by bridges lower down.Gaining the <DW72>s of the mountain the Federal
troops rushed on in their advance.From the high palisaded summit,
invisible in the low-hanging clouds, the guns of General Stevenson's
brigades poured an iron deluge upon them.But on they went, climbing over
ledges and boulders, up hill and down, while the soldiers of the South
with musket and cannon tried in vain to check them.Position after
position was abandoned to the onrushing Federals, and by noon Geary's
advanced troops had rounded the north <DW72> of the mountain and passed
from the sight of General Hooker, who was watching the contest from a
vantage point to the west.Grant and Thomas from the headquarters on
Orchard Knob were likewise eager witnesses of the struggle, although the
haze was so dense that they caught a glimpse only now and then as the
clouds would rise.Reenforcements came to the Confederates and they availed nothing.Geary's
troops had been ordered to halt when they reached the foot of the
palisades, but fired by success they pressed impetuously forward.From its
higher position at the base of the cliff Cobham's brigade showered volley
after volley upon the Confederate main line of defense, while that of
Ireland gradually rolled up the flank.The Federal batteries on Moccasin
Point across the river were doing what they could to clear the mountain.The Southerners made a last stand in their walls and pits around the
Craven house, but were finally driven in force over rocks and precipices
into Chattanooga Valley.Such was the "battle in the clouds," a wonderful spectacle denied the
remainder of Hooker's troops holding Lookout Valley.That general says,
"From the moment we had rounded the peak of the mountain it was only from
the roar of battle and the occasional glimpses our comrades in the valley
could catch of our lines and standards that they knew of the strife or
its progress, and when from these evidences our true condition was
revealed to them their painful anxiety yielded to transports of joy which
only soldiers can feel in the earliest moments of dawning victory."By two in the afternoon the clouds had settled completely into the valley
and the ensuing darkness put an end to further operations.Hooker
established and strengthened a new position and waited for reenforcements,
which General Carlin brought from Chattanooga at five o'clock.Until after
midnight an irregular fire was kept up, but the Confederates could not
break the new line.Before dawn General Stevenson abandoned the summit,
leaving behind twenty thousand rations and the camp equipage of his three
brigades.Hooker, anticipating this move, sent several detachments to
scale the palisades.A party of six men from the Eighth Kentucky regiment,
by means of ladders, was the first to reach the summit, and the waving
Stars and Stripes greeted the rising sun of November 25th on Lookout
Mountain, amid the wild and prolonged cheers of "Fighting Joe's" valiant
troops.The fighting of Sherman and Hooker on the 24th secured to Grant's army a
distinct advantage in position.From the north end of Lookout Mountain
across Chattanooga Valley to the north end of Missionary Ridge the Union
forces maintained an unbroken front.The morning of the 25th dawned cold, and an impenetrable mist which lay
deep in the valleys was soon driven away.From Orchard Knob, a point
almost in the center of the united Federal host, General Grant watched the
preparations for the battle.At sunrise, Sherman's command was in motion.In his front, an open space intervened between his position and a ridge
held by the Confederates, while just beyond rose a much higher hill.Toward the first ridge the attacking column, under General Corse, advanced
rapidly and in full view of the foe.For a time it seemed as if the
Confederates must recede before the terrific onslaught, but the advance
was abruptly checked after a very close and stubborn struggle, when
within a short distance of the entrenchment.Unmindful of the numbers which opposed him, General Hardee not only
succeeded in repulsing the attack, but, assuming the offensive, drove back
the forces under General John E. Smith, who had sought to turn his left,
and captured several hundred prisoners.The Federals, quickly re-forming
their lines, renewed the assault and for several hours the fighting was
desperate on both sides.A general advance of the Northern forces had been
withheld, awaiting the arrival of Hooker who, under orders from Grant, was
sweeping down Chickamauga Valley, and was to operate against the
Confederate left and rear, in the expectation that Bragg would further
weaken his line by massing at those points.But Hooker's army had been
delayed several hours by repairs to the bridge crossing Chattanooga Creek.Although Sherman had failed in his attempt to turn the Confederate right
he had forced Bragg to draw heavily upon his center for reenforcements.Grant, satisfied that Hooker was not far off, ordered the signal--six guns
fired in rapid succession from the battery on Orchard Knob--for a general
advance of Thomas' army upon the Confederate center.It was now three o'clock in the afternoon.The four division commanders of
the Army of the Cumberland, Sheridan, Wood, Baird, and Johnson, gave the
word to advance.Between Orchard Knob and the base of Missionary Ridge, a
mile away, is a broad valley covered for the most part with heavy timber.This had to be crossed before the entrenchments at the foot of the hill
could be assaulted.Scarcely were the Cumberland troops in motion when
fifty pieces of artillery on the crest of Missionary Ridge opened a
terrific fire upon them.But the onward rush of the Federals was not
checked in the slightest degree.The line of entrenchments at the base was
carried with little opposition.Most of Breckinridge's men abandoned the
ditches as the Federal skirmishers approached and sought refuge up the
hill, breaking and throwing into confusion other troops as they passed
through.At the foot of Missionary Ridge Thomas' army had reached its goal.But, as General Wood has related, "the
enthusiasm and impetuosity of the troops were such that those who first
reached the entrenchments at the base of the ridge bounded over them and
pressed on up the ascent.... Moreover the entrenchments were no protection
against the artillery on the ridge.To remain would be destruction--to
return would be both expensive in life, and disgraceful.Officers and men,
all seemed impressed with this truth.... Without waiting for an order the
vast mass pressed forward in the race for glory, each man anxious to be
the first on the summit.... Artillery and musketry could not check the
impetuous assault.To have done so would
have been ruinous.Little was left to the commanders of the troops than to
cheer on the foremost--to encourage the weaker of limb and to sustain the
very few who seemed to be faint-hearted."Midway up the <DW72> was a small line of rifle-pits, but these proved of no
use in stemming the Federal tide.In the immediate front, however, Major
Weaver of the Sixtieth North Carolina rallied a sufficient number of the
demoralized Confederates to send a well-directed and effective fire upon
the advancing troops.At this point the first line of oncoming Federals
was vigorously repulsed, and thrown back to the vacated Confederate
trenches.General Bragg, noticing this, rode along the ridge to spread his
good news among the troops, but he had not gone far when word was brought
that the right flank was broken and that the Federal standard had been
seen on the summit.A second and a third flag appeared in quick
succession.Bragg sent General Bate to drive the foe back, but the
disaster was so great that the latter was unable to repair it.Even the
artillery had abandoned the infantry.The Confederate flank had gone, and
within an hour of the start from Orchard Knob the crest of Missionary
Ridge was occupied by Federal troops.He went
down the eastern <DW72>, driving all in front of him toward Chickamauga
Creek.On a more easterly ridge he rested until midnight, when he advanced
to the creek and took many prisoners and stores.While the Army of the Cumberland accomplished these things, Hooker was
advancing his divisions at charging pace from the south.Cruft was on the
crest, Osterhaus in the eastern valley, and Geary in the western--all
within easy supporting distance.Before Cruft's onrush the left wing of
Bragg's army was scattered in all directions from the ridge.Many ran down
the eastern <DW72> into Osterhaus' column and the very few who chose a way
of flight to the west, were captured by Geary.The bulk of them, however,
fell back from trench to trench upon the crest until finally, as the sun
was sinking, they found themselves surrounded by Johnson's division of the
Army of the Cumberland.Such was the fate of Stewart's division; only a
small portion of it got away.On the Confederate right Hardee held his own against Sherman, but with the
left and center routed and in rapid flight Bragg realized the day was
lost.He could do nothing but cover Breckinridge's retreat as best he
might and order Hardee to retire across Chickamauga Creek.Bragg's army had been wholly
defeated, and, after being pursued for some days, it found a resting place
at Dalton among the mountains of Georgia.The Federal victory was the
result of a campaign carefully planned by Generals Halleck and Grant and
ably carried out by the efforts of the subordinate generals.The losses in killed and wounded sustained by Grant were over fifty-eight
hundred and those of Bragg about sixty-six hundred, four thousand being
prisoners.But the advantage of the great position had been forever
wrested from the Southern army.[Illustration: THE BESIEGED

ground overlooking the stream, was posted Battery McAloon to keep the
Confederates back from the river, so that timber and firewood could be
rafted down to the besieged army.In the chill of autumn, with scanty
rations, the soldiers had a hard time keeping warm, as all fuel within the
lines had been consumed.The Army of the Cumberland was almost conquered
by hardship.Grant feared that the soldiers "could not be got out of their
trenches to assume the offensive."But it was these very men who achieved
the most signal victory in the battle of Chattanooga.[Illustration: OPENING "THE CRACKER LINE"

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]_Chattanooga_ was the first steamboat built by the Federals
on the upper Tennessee River.Had the gunboats on the Ohio been able to
come up the Tennessee River nearly three hundred miles, to the assistance
of Rosecrans, Bragg could never have bottled him up in Chattanooga.But
between Florence and Decatur, Alabama, Muscle Shoals lay in the stream,
making the river impassable.While Bragg's pickets invested the railroad
and river, supplies could not be brought up from Bridgeport; and besides,
with the exception of one small steamboat (the _Dunbar_), the Federals had
no boats on the river.General W. F. Smith, Chief Engineer of the Army of
the Cumberland, had established a saw-mill with an old engine at
Bridgeport for the purpose of getting out lumber from logs rafted down the
river, with which to construct pontoons.Here Captain Arthur Edwards,
Assistant Quartermaster, had been endeavoring since the siege began to
build a steamboat consisting of a flat-bottom scow, with engine, boiler,
and stern-wheel mounted upon it.On October 24th, after many difficulties
and discouragements had been overcome, the vessel was launched
successfully and christened the _Chattanooga_.On the 29th she made her
trial trip.That very night, Hooker, in the battle of Wauhatchie,
definitely established control of the new twelve-mile "Cracker Line" from
Kelley's Ferry, which Grant had ordered for the relief of the starving
army.The next day the little _Chattanooga_, with steam up, was ready to
start from Bridgeport with a heavy load of the much-needed supplies, and
her arrival was anxiously awaited at Kelley's Ferry, where the
wagon-trains were all ready to rush forward the rations and forage to
Chattanooga.The mechanics were still at work upon the little vessel's
unfinished pilot-house and boiler-deck while she and the two barges she
was to tow were being loaded, and at 4 A.M.on November 30th she set out
to make the 45-mile journey against unfavorable head-winds.[Illustration: THE WELCOME NEWCOMER

and dangers on her memorable voyage of November 30th.She made but slow
progress against the wind and the rapid current of the tortuous Tennessee.Fearful of breaking a steam pipe or starting a leak, she crawled along all
day, and then was enveloped in one of the darkest of nights, out of which
a blinding rain stung the faces of her anxious crew.Assistant
Quartermaster William G. Le Duc, in command of the expedition, helped the
pilot to feel his way through the darkness.At last the camp-fires of the
Federals became guiding beacons from the shore and soon the _Chattanooga_
tied up safely at Kelley's Ferry.The "Cracker Line" was at last opened in
the nick of time, for there were but four boxes of hard bread left in the
commissary at Chattanooga, where four cakes of hard bread and one-quarter
of a pound of pork were being issued as a three-days' ration.[Illustration: WHERE AN ARMY GAVE ITS OWN ORDERS

Confederates and captured Orchard Knob (or Indian Hill) a day before it
had been planned to do so.Still another surprise awaited Grant on the
25th, when from this eminence he watched the magnificent spectacle of the
battle of Chattanooga.Thomas' men again pressed forward in what was
ordered as a demonstration against Missionary Ridge.Up and over it they

they drove back the Confederates and established the new line of

another.The heavy musketry fire and the boom of the Confederate battery
on the top of the mountain apprised the waiting Federals before
Chattanooga that the battle had begun.Now and again the fitful lifting of
the mist disclosed to Grant and Thomas, watching from Orchard Knob, the
men of Hooker fighting upon the heights.Then all would be curtained once
more.At two o'clock in the afternoon the mist became so heavy that Hooker
and his men could not see what they were doing, and paused to entrench.By
four o'clock, however, he had pushed on to the summit and reported to
Grant that his position was impregnable.Direct communication was then
established and reenforcements sent.[Illustration: THE PEAK OF VICTORY--THE MORNING AFTER THE BATTLE

THE BATTLE IN THE WILDERNESS

    The volunteers who composed the armies of the Potomac and Northern
    Virginia were real soldiers now, inured to war, and desperate in their
    determination to do its work without faltering or failure.This
    fact--this change in the temper and _morale_ of the men on either
    side--had greatly simplified the tasks set for Grant and Lee to solve.They knew that those men would stand against
    anything, endure slaughter without flinching, hardship without
    complaining, and make desperate endeavor without shrinking.The two
    armies had become what they had not been earlier in the contest,
    _perfect instruments of war_, that could be relied upon as confidently
    as the machinist relies upon his engine scheduled to make so many
    revolutions per minute at a given rate of horse-power, and with the
    precision of science itself.--_George Cary Eggleston, in "The History
    of the Confederate War."_


After the battle of Gettysburg, Lee started for the Potomac, which he
crossed with some difficulty, but with little interruption from the
Federals, above Harper's Ferry, on July 14, 1863.The thwarted invader of
Pennsylvania wished to get to the plains of Virginia as quickly as
possible, but the Shenandoah was found to be impassable.Meade, in the
mean time, had crossed the Potomac east of the Blue Ridge and seized the
principal outlets from the lower part of the Valley.Lee, therefore, was
compelled to continue his retreat up the Shenandoah until Longstreet, sent
in advance with part of his command, had so blocked the Federal pursuit
that most of the Confederate army was able to emerge through Chester Gap
and move to Culpeper Court House.Ewell marched through Thornton's Gap and
by the 4th of August practically the whole Army of Northern Virginia was
south of the Rapidan, prepared to dispute the crossing of that river.But
Meade, continuing his flank pursuit, halted at Culpeper Court House,
deeming it imprudent to attempt the Rapidan in the face of the strongly
entrenched Confederates.In the entire movement there had been no fighting
except a few cavalry skirmishes and no serious loss on either side.On the 9th of September, Lee sent Longstreet and his corps to assist Bragg
in the great conflict that was seen to be inevitable around Chattanooga.In spite of reduced strength, Lee proceeded to assume a threatening
attitude toward Meade, and in October and early November there were
several small but severe engagements as the Confederate leader attempted
to turn Meade's flank and force him back to the old line of Bull Run.On
the 7th of November, Sedgwick made a brilliant capture of the redoubts on
the Rappahannock, and Lee returned once more to his old position on the
south side of the Rapidan.This lay between Barnett's Ford, near Orange
Court House (Lee's headquarters), and Morton's Ford, twenty miles below.Its right was also protected by entrenchments along the course of Mine
Run.Against these, in the last days of November, Meade sent French,
Sedgwick, and Warren.It was found impossible to carry the Confederate
position, and on December 1st the Federal troops were ordered to recross
the Rapidan.In this short campaign the Union lost sixteen hundred men and
the Confederacy half that number.With the exception of an unsuccessful
cavalry raid against Richmond, in February, nothing disturbed the
existence of the two armies until the coming of Grant.In the early months of 1864, the Army of the Potomac lay between the
Rapidan and the Rappahannock, most of it in the vicinity of Culpeper Court
House, although some of the troops were guarding the railroad to
Washington as far as Bristoe Station, close to Manassas Junction.On the
south side of the Rapidan, the Army of Northern Virginia was, as has been
seen, securely entrenched.The Confederates' ranks were thin and their
supplies were scarce; but the valiant spirit which had characterized the
Southern hosts in former battles still burned fiercely within their
breasts, presaging many desperate battles before the heel of the invader
should tread upon their cherished capital, Richmond, and their loved
cause, the Confederacy.Within the camp religious services had been held for weeks in succession,
resulting in the conversion of large numbers of the soldiers.The influence of the awakening among the men in the
army during this revival was manifest after the war was over, when the
soldiers had gone back to civil life, under conditions most trying and
severe.To this spiritual frame of mind may be credited, perhaps, some of
the remarkable feats accomplished in subsequent battles by the Confederate
army.On February 29, 1864, the United States Congress passed law reviving the
grade of lieutenant-general, the title being intended for Grant, who was
made general-in-chief of the armies of the United States.Grant had come
from his victorious battle-grounds in the West, and all eyes turned to him
as the chieftain who should lead the Union army to success.On the 9th of
March he received his commission.He now planned the final great double
movement of the war.Taking control of the whole campaign against Lee, but
leaving the Army of the Potomac under Meade's direct command, he chose the
strongest of his corps commanders, W. T. Sherman, for the head of affairs
in the West.Grant's immediate objects were to defeat Lee's army and to
capture Richmond, the latter to be accomplished by General Butler and the
Army of the James; Sherman's object was to crush Johnston, to seize that
important railroad center, Atlanta, Georgia, and, with Banks' assistance,
to open a way between the Atlantic coast and Mobile, on the Gulf, thus
dividing the Confederacy north and south, as the conquest of the
Mississippi had parted it east and west.It was believed that if either or
both of these campaigns were successful, the downfall of the Confederacy
would be assured.On a recommendation of General Meade's, the Army of the Potomac was
reorganized into three corps instead of the previous five.The Second,
Fifth, and Sixth corps were retained, absorbing the First and Third.Hancock was in command of the Second; Warren, the Fifth; and Sedgwick, the
Sixth.Sheridan was at the head of the cavalry.The Ninth Corps acted as a
separate army under Burnside, and was now protecting the Orange and
Alexandria Railroad.As soon as Meade had crossed the Rapidan, Burnside
was ordered to move promptly, and he reached the battlefield of the
Wilderness on the morning of May 6th.On May 24th his corps was assigned
to the Army of the Potomac.The Union forces, including the Ninth Corps,
numbered about one hundred and eighteen thousand men.The Army of Northern Virginia consisted of three corps of infantry, the
First under Longstreet, the Second under Ewell, and the Third under A. P.
Hill, and a cavalry corps commanded by Stuart.A notable fact in the
organization of the Confederate army was the few changes made in
commanders.The total forces under Lee were about sixty-two thousand.After assuming command, Grant established his headquarters at Culpeper
Court House, whence he visited Washington once a week to consult with
President Lincoln and the Secretary of War.He was given full authority,
however, as to men and movements, and worked out a plan of campaign which
resulted in a series of battles in Virginia unparalleled in history.The
first of these was precipitated in a dense forest, a wilderness, from
which the battle takes its name.Grant decided on a general advance of the Army of the Potomac upon Lee,
and early on the morning of May 4th the movement began by crossing the
Rapidan at several fords below Lee's entrenched position, and moving by
his right flank.The crossing was effected successfully, the line of march
taking part of the Federal troops over a scene of defeat in the previous
spring.One year before, the magnificent Army of the Potomac, just from a
long winter's rest in the encampment at Falmouth on the north bank of the
Rappahannock, had met the legions of the South in deadly combat on the
battlefield of Chancellorsville.And now Grant was leading the same army,
whose ranks had been freshened by new recruits from the North, through the
same field of war.By eight o'clock on the morning of the 4th the various rumors as to the
Federal army's crossing the Rapidan received by Lee were fully confirmed,
and at once he prepared to set his own army in motion for the Wilderness,
and to throw himself across the path of his foe.Two days before he had
gathered his corps and division commanders around him at the signal
station on Clark's Mountain, a considerable eminence south of the Rapidan,
near Robertson's Ford.Here he expressed the opinion that Grant would
cross at the lower fords, as he did, but nevertheless Longstreet was kept
at Gordonsville in case the Federals should move by the Confederate left.The day was oppressively hot, and the troops suffered greatly from thirst
as they plodded along the forest aisles through the jungle-like region.The Wilderness was a maze of trees, underbrush, and ragged foliage.Low-limbed pines, scrub-oaks, hazels, and chinkapins interlaced their
branches on the sides of rough country roads that lead through this
labyrinth of desolation.The weary troops looked upon the heavy tangles of
fallen timber and dense undergrowth with a sense of isolation.Only the
sounds of the birds in the trees, the rustling of the leaves, and the
passing of the army relieved the heavy pall of solitude that bore upon the
senses of the Federal host.The forces of the Northern army advanced into the vast no-man's land by
the roads leading from the fords.In the afternoon, Hancock was resting at
Chancellorsville, while Warren posted his corps near the Wilderness
Tavern, in which General Grant established his headquarters.Sedgwick's
corps had followed in the track of Warren's veterans, but was ordered to
halt near the river crossing, or a little south of it.The cavalry, as
much as was not covering the rear wagon trains, was stationed near
Chancellorsville and the Wilderness Tavern.That night the men from the
North lay in bivouac with little fear of being attacked in this wilderness
of waste, where military maneuvers would be very difficult.Two roads--the old Orange turnpike and the Orange plank road--enter the
Wilderness from the southwest.Along these the Confederates moved from
their entrenched position to oppose the advancing hosts of the North.Ewell took the old turnpike and Hill the plank road.Longstreet was
hastening from Gordonsville.The troops of Longstreet, on the one side,
and of Burnside, on the other, arrived on the field after exhausting
forced marches.The locality in which the Federal army found itself on the 5th of May was
not one that any commander would choose for a battle-ground.Lee was more
familiar with its terrible features than was his opponent, but this gave
him little or no advantage.Grant, having decided to move by the
Confederate right flank, could only hope to pass through the desolate
region and reach more open country before the inevitable clash would come.General Humphreys, who was Meade's chief of staff,
says in his "Virginia Campaign of 1864 and 1865": "So far as I know, no
great battle ever took place before on such ground.But little of the
combatants could be seen, and its progress was known to the senses chiefly
by the rising and falling sounds of a vast musketry fire that continually
swept along the lines of battle, many miles in length, sounds which at
times approached to the sublime."As Ewell, moving along the old turnpike on the morning of May 5th, came
near the Germanna Ford road, Warren's corps was marching down the latter
on its way to Parker's store, the destination assigned it by the orders of
the day.This meeting precipitated the battle of the Wilderness.Meade learned the position of Ewell's advance division and ordered an
attack.The Confederates were driven back a mile or two, but, re-forming
and reenforced, the tide of battle was turned the other way.Sedgwick's
marching orders were sending him to the Wilderness Tavern on the turnpike.He was on his way when the battle began, and he now turned to the right
from the Germanna Ford road and formed several of his divisions on
Warren's right.The presence of Hill on the plank road became known to
Meade and Grant, about eight in the morning.Hancock, at Chancellorsville,
was too far away to check him, so Getty's division of Sedgwick's corps, on
its way to the right, was sent over the Brock road to its junction with
the plank road for the purpose of driving Hill back, if possible, beyond
Parker's store.Warren and Sedgwick began to entrench themselves when they realized that
Ewell had effectively blocked their progress.Getty, at the junction of
the Brock and the Orange plank roads, was likewise throwing up breastworks
as fast as he could.Hancock, coming down the Brock road from
Chancellorsville, reached him at two in the afternoon and found two of A.
P. Hill's divisions in front.After waiting to finish his breastworks,
Getty, a little after four o'clock, started, with Hancock supporting him,
to carry out his orders to drive Hill back.Hancock says: "The fighting
became very fierce at once.The lines of battle were exceedingly close,
the musketry continuous and deadly along the entire line.... The battle
raged with great severity and obstinacy until about 8 P.M.Here, on the Federal left, and in this
desperate engagement, General Alexander Hays, one of Hancock's brigade
commanders, was shot through the head and killed.The afternoon had worn away with heavy skirmishing on the right.About
five o'clock Meade made another attempt on Ewell's forces.Both lines were
well entrenched, but the Confederate artillery enfiladed the Federal
positions.It was after dark when General Seymour of Sedgwick's corps
finally withdrew his brigade, with heavy loss in killed and wounded.When the battle roar had ceased, the rank and file of the Confederate
soldiers learned with sorrow of the death of one of the most dashing
brigade leaders in Ewell's corps, General John M. Jones.This fighting was
the preliminary struggle for position in the formation of the battle-lines
of the two armies, to secure the final hold for the death grapple.The
contestants were without advantage on either side when the sanguinary
day's work was finished.Both armies had constructed breastworks and were entrenched very close to
each other, front to front, gathered and poised for a deadly spring.Early
on the morning of May 6th Hancock was reenforced by Burnside, and Hill by
Longstreet.Grant issued orders, through Meade, for a general attack by Sedgwick,
Warren, and Hancock along the entire line, at five o'clock on the morning
of the 6th.Fifteen minutes before five the Confederates opened fire on
Sedgwick's right, and soon the battle was raging along the whole five-mile
front.It became a hand-to-hand contest.The Federals advanced with great
difficulty.The combatants came upon each other but a few paces apart.Soldiers on one side became hopelessly mixed with those of the other.Artillery played but little part in the battle of the Wilderness.The
cavalry of the two armies had one indecisive engagement on the 5th.The
next day both Custer and Gregg repulsed Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee in two
separate encounters, but Sheridan was unable to follow up the advantage.He had been entrusted with the care of the wagon trains and dared not take
his cavalry too far from them.The battle was chiefly one of musketry.Volley upon volley was poured out unceasingly; screaming bullets mingled
with terrific yells in the dense woods.The noise became deafening, and
the wounded and dying lying on the ground among the trees made a scene of
indescribable horror.Living men rushed in to take the places of those
who had fallen.The missiles cut branches from the trees, and saplings
were mowed down as grass in a meadow is cut by a scythe.Bloody remnants
of uniforms, blue and gray, hung as weird and uncanny decorations from
remaining branches.The story of the Federal right during the morning is easily told.Persistently and often as he tried, Warren could make no impression on the
strongly entrenched Ewell--nor could Sedgwick, who was trying equally hard
with Wright's division of his corps.But with Hancock on the left, in his
entrenchments on the Brock road, it was different.The gallant and heroic
charges here have elicited praise and admiration from friend and foe
alike.At first, Hill was forced back in disorder, and driven in confusion
a mile and a half from his line.The Confederates seemed on the verge of
panic and rout.From the rear of the troops in gray came the beloved
leader of the Southern host, General Lee.He was astride his favorite
battle-horse, and his face was set in lines of determination.Though the
crisis of the battle for the Confederates had arrived, Lee's voice was
calm and soft as he commanded, "Follow me," and then urged his charger
toward the bristling front of the Federal lines.The Confederate ranks
were electrified by the brave example of their commander.A ragged veteran
who had followed Lee through many campaigns, leaped forward and caught the
bridle-rein of the horse."We won't go on until you go back," cried the
devoted warrior.Instantly the Confederate ranks resounded with the cry,
"Lee to the rear!and the great general went back to
safety while his soldiers again took up the gage of battle and plunged
into the smoke and death-laden storm.But Lee, by his personal presence,
and the arrival of Longstreet, had restored order and courage in the
ranks, and their original position was soon regained.The pursuit of the Confederates through the dense forest had caused
confusion and disorganization in Hancock's corps.That cohesion and
strength in a battle-line of soldiers, where the men can "feel the touch,"
shoulder to shoulder, was wanting, and the usual form and regular
alignment was broken.It was two hours before the lines were re-formed.That short time had been well utilized by the Confederates.Gregg's eight
hundred Texans made a desperate charge through the thicket of the pine
against Webb's brigade of Hancock's corps, cutting through the growth, and
wildly shouting amid the crash and roar of the battle.Half of their
number were left on the field, but the blow had effectually checked the
Federal advance.While the battle was raging Grant's general demeanor was imperturbable.He
remained with Meade nearly the whole day at headquarters at the Lacy
house.He sat upon a stump most of the time, or at the foot of a tree,
leaning against its trunk, whittling sticks with his pocket-knife and
smoking big black cigars--twenty during the day.He received reports of
the progress of the battle and gave orders without the least evidence of
excitement or emotion."His orders," said one of his staff, "were given
with a spur," implying instant action.On one occasion, when an officer,
in great excitement, brought him the report of Hancock's misfortune and
expressed apprehension as to Lee's purpose, Grant exclaimed with some
warmth: "Oh, I am heartily tired of hearing what Lee is going to do.Go
back to your command and try to think what we are going to do ourselves."Several brigades of Longstreet's troops, though weary from their forced
march, were sent on a flanking movement against Hancock's left, which
demoralized Mott's division and caused it to fall back three-quarters of a
mile.Longstreet now advanced with the rest of his corps.The dashing
leader, while riding with Generals Kershaw and Jenkins at the head of
Jenkins' brigade on the right of the Southern battle array, was screened
by the tangled thickets from the view of his own troops, flushed with the
success of brilliant flank movement.Suddenly the passing column was seen
indistinctly through an opening and a volley burst forth and struck the
officers.When the smoke lifted Longstreet and Jenkins were down--the
former seriously wounded, and the latter killed outright.As at
Chancellorsville a year before and on the same battle-ground, a great
captain of the Confederacy was shot down by his own men, and by accident,
at the crisis of a battle.Jackson lingered several days after
Chancellorsville, while Longstreet recovered and lived to fight for the
Confederacy till the surrender at Appomattox.General Wadsworth, of
Hancock's corps, was mortally wounded during the day, while making a
daring assault on the Confederate works, at the head of his men.During the afternoon, the Confederate attack upon Hancock's and Burnside's
forces, which constituted nearly half the entire army, was so severe that
the Federal lines began to give way.The combatants swayed back and forth;
the Confederates seized the Federal breastworks repeatedly, only to be
repulsed again and again.Once, the Southern colors were placed on the
Union battlements.A fire in the forest, which had been burning for hours,
and in which, it is estimated, about two hundred of the Federal wounded
perished, was communicated to the timber entrenchments, the heat and smoke
driving into the faces of the men on the Union side, and compelling them
in some places to abandon the works.Hancock made a gallant and heroic
effort to re-form his lines and push the attack, and, as he rode along the
lines, his inspiring presence elicited cheer upon cheer from the men, but
the troops had exhausted their ammunition, the wagons were in the rear,
and as night was approaching, further attack was abandoned.The contest
ended on the lines where it began.Later in the evening consternation swept the Federal camp when heavy
firing was heard in the direction of Sedgwick's corps, on the right.The
report was current that the entire Sixth Corps had been attacked and
broken.What had happened was a surprise attack by the Confederates,
commanded by General John B. Gordon, on Sedgwick's right flank, Generals
Seymour and Shaler with six hundred men being captured.When a message was
received from Sedgwick that the Sixth Corps was safe in an entirely new
line, there was great rejoicing in the Union camp.Thus ended the two days' fighting of the battle of the Wilderness, one of
the greatest struggles in history.It was Grant's first experience in the
East, and his trial measure of arms with his great antagonist, General
Lee.The latter returned to his entrenchments and the Federals remained in
their position.While Grant had been
defeated in his plan to pass around Lee, yet he had made a new record for
the Army of the Potomac, and he was not turned from his purpose of putting
himself between the Army of Northern Virginia and the capital of the
Confederacy.During the two days' engagement, there were ten hours of
actual fighting, with a loss in killed and wounded of about seventeen
thousand Union and nearly twelve thousand Confederates, nearly three
thousand men sacrificed each hour.It is the belief of some military
writers that Lee deliberately chose the Wilderness as a battle-ground, as
it would effectually conceal great inferiority of force, but if this be so
he seems to have come to share the unanimous opinions of the generals of
both sides that its difficulties were unsurmountable, and within his
entrenchments he awaited further attack.The next night, May 7th, Grant's march by the Confederate right flank was
resumed, but only to be blocked again by the dogged determination of the
tenacious antagonist, a few miles beyond, at Spotsylvania.It is not strange that the minds of these two
men moved along the same lines in military strategy, when we remember they
were both military experts of the highest order, and were now working out
the same problem.The results obtained by each are told in the story of
the battle of Spotsylvania.[Illustration: LEE'S MEN]

The faces of the veterans in this photograph of 1864 reflect more forcibly
than volumes of historical essays, the privations and the courage of the
ragged veterans in gray who faced Grant, with Lee as their leader.They
did not know that their struggle had already become unavailing; that no
amount of perseverance and devotion could make headway against the
resources, determination, and discipline of the Northern armies, now that
they had become concentrated and wielded by a master of men like Grant.But Grant was as yet little more than a name to the armies of the East.His successes had been won on Western fields--Donelson, Vicksburg,
Chattanooga.It was not yet known that the Army of the Potomac under the
new general-in-chief was to prove irresistible.[Illustration: CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS IN VIRGINIA, 1864

captures during May and June, when he sent some ten thousand Confederates
to Coxey's Landing, Virginia, as a result of his first stroke against
Lee--though their arms have been taken from them, though their uniforms
are anything but "uniform," their hats partly the regulation felt of the
Army of Northern Virginia, partly captured Federal caps, and partly
nondescript--yet these ragged veterans stand and sit with the dignity of
accomplishment.To them, "Marse Robert" is still the general
unconquerable, under whom inferior numbers again and again have held their
own, and more; the brilliant leader under whom every man gladly rushes to
any assault, however impossible it seems, knowing that every order will be
made to count.[Illustration: THE COMING OF THE STRANGER GRANT

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Hither, to Meade's headquarters at Brandy Station, came Grant on March 10,
1864.The day before, in Washington, President Lincoln handed him his
commission, appointing him Lieutenant-General in command of all the
Federal forces.His visit to Washington convinced him of the wisdom of
remaining in the East to direct affairs, and his first interview with
Meade decided him to retain that efficient general in command of the Army
of the Potomac.The two men had known each other but slightly from casual
meetings during the Mexican War."I was a stranger to most of the Army of
the Potomac," said Grant, "but Meade's modesty and willingness to serve in
any capacity impressed me even more than had his victory at Gettysburg."The only prominent officers Grant brought on from the West were Sheridan
and Rawlins.[Illustration: SIGNALING ORDERS FROM GENERAL MEADE'S HEADQUARTERS, JUST
BEFORE THE WILDERNESS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]In April, 1864, General Meade's headquarters lay north of the Rapidan.The
Signal Corps was kept busy transmitting the orders preliminary to the
Wilderness campaign, which was to begin May 5th.The headquarters are
below the brow of the hill.A most important part of the Signal Corps'
duty was the interception and translation of messages interchanged between
the Confederate signal-men.A veteran of Sheridan's army tells of his
impressions as follows: "On the evening of the 18th of October, 1864, the
soldiers of Sheridan's army lay in their lines at Cedar Creek.Our
attention was suddenly directed to the ridge of Massanutten, or Three Top
Mountain, the <DW72> of which covered the left wing of the army--the Eighth
Corps.A lively series of signals was being flashed out from the peak, and
it was evident that messages were being sent both eastward and westward of
the ridge.I can recall now the feeling with which we looked up at those
flashes going over our heads, knowing that they must be Confederate
messages.It was only later that we learned that a keen-eyed Union officer
had been able to read the message: 'To Lieutenant-General Early.Be ready
to move as soon as my forces join you, and we will crush Sheridan.The sturdiness of Sheridan's veterans and
the fresh spirit put into the hearts of the men by the return of Sheridan
himself from 'Winchester, twenty miles away,' a ride rendered immortal by
Read's poem, proved too much at last for the pluck and persistency of
Early's worn-out troops."[Illustration: ON THE WAY TO THE FRONT

the Army of the Potomac awoke to the activity of the spring campaign.One
of the first essentials was to get the vast transport trains in readiness
to cross the Rapidan.Wagons were massed by thousands at Culpeper, near
where Meade's troops had spent the winter.The work of the teamsters was
most arduous; wearied by long night marches--nodding, reins in hand, for
lack of sleep--they might at any moment be suddenly attacked in a bold
attempt to capture or destroy their precious freight.When the
arrangements were completed, each wagon bore the corps badge, division
color, and number of the brigade it was to serve.Its contents were also
designated, together with the branch of the service for which it was
intended.While loaded, the wagons must keep pace with the army movements
whenever possible in order to be parked at night near the brigades to
which they belonged.[Illustration: THE "GRAND CAMPAIGN" UNDER WAY--THE DAY BEFORE THE BATTLE

under Sedgwick and Warren's Fifth Corps began crossing on the morning of
May 4, 1864.The Second Corps, under Hancock, crossed at Ely's Ford,
farther to the east.The cavalry, under Sheridan, was in advance.By night
the army, with the exception of Burnside's Ninth Corps, was south of the
Rapidan, advancing into the Wilderness.The Ninth Corps (a reserve of
twenty thousand men) remained temporarily north of the Rappahannock,
guarding railway communications.On the wooden pontoon-bridge the
rear-guard is crossing while the pontonniers are taking up the canvas
bridge beyond.The movement was magnificently managed; Grant believed it
to be a complete surprise, as Lee had offered no opposition.In the baffling fighting of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania Court
House, Grant was to lose a third of his superior number, arriving a month
later on the James with a dispirited army that had left behind 54,926
comrades in a month.[Illustration: THE TANGLED BATTLEFIELD

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The Edge of the Wilderness, May 5, 1864.Stretching away to the westward
between Grant's army and Lee's lay no-man's-land--the Wilderness.Covered
with a second-growth of thicket, thorny underbrush, and twisted vines, it
was an almost impassable labyrinth, with here and there small clearings in
which stood deserted barns and houses, reached only by unused and
overgrown farm roads.The Federal advance into this region was not a
surprise to Lee, as Grant supposed.The Confederate commander had caused
the region to be carefully surveyed, hoping for the precise opportunity
that Grant was about to give him.At the very outset of the campaign he
could strike the Federals in a position where superior numbers counted
little.If he could drive Grant beyond the Rappahannock--as he had forced
Pope, Burnside and Hooker before him--says George Cary Eggleston (in the
"History of the Confederate War"), "loud and almost irresistible would
have been the cry for an armistice, supported (as it would have been) by
Wall Street and all Europe."[Illustration: WHERE EWELL'S CHARGE SURPRISED GRANT

before, while they fought in the Wilderness, May 5, 1864.In the picture
we see some of the customary breastworks which both contending armies
threw up to strengthen their positions.These were in a field near the
turnpike in front of Ewell's main line.The impracticable nature of the
ground tore the lines on both sides into fragments; as they swept back and
forth, squads and companies strove fiercely with one another,
hand-to-hand.Grant had confidently expressed the belief to one of his
staff officers that there was no more advance left in Lee's army.He was
surprised to learn on the 5th that Ewell's Corps was marching rapidly down
the Orange turnpike to strike at Sedgwick and Warren, while A. P. Hill,
with Longstreet close behind, was pushing forward on the Orange plank-road
against Hancock.LEE GIVES BLOW FOR BLOW

[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Another view of Ewell's advanced entrenchments--the bark still fresh where
the Confederates had worked with the logs.In the Wilderness, Lee, ever
bold and aggressive, executed one of the most brilliant maneuvers of his
career.His advance was a sudden surprise for Grant, and the manner in
which he gave battle was another.Grant harbored the notion that his
adversary would act on the defensive, and that there would be opportunity
to attack the Army of Northern Virginia only behind strong entrenchments.But in the Wilderness, Lee's veterans, the backbone of the South's
fighting strength, showed again their unquenchable spirit of
aggressiveness.They came forth to meet Grant's men on equal terms in the
thorny thickets.About noon, May 5th, the stillness was broken by the
rattle of musketry and the roar of artillery, which told that Warren had
met with resistance on the turnpike and that the battle had begun.Nearly
a mile were Ewell's men driven back, and then they came magnificently on
again, fighting furiously in the smoke-filled thickets with Warren's now
retreating troops.Sedgwick, coming to the support of Warren, renewed the
conflict.To the southward on the plank road, Getty's division, of the
Sixth Corps, hard pressed by the forces of A. P. Hill, was succored by
Hancock with the Second Corps, and together these commanders achieved what
seemed success.It was brief; Longstreet was close at hand to save the day
for the Confederates.TREES IN THE TRACK OF THE IRON STORM

[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The Wilderness to the north of the Orange turnpike.Over ground like this,
where men had seldom trod before, ebbed and flowed the tide of trampling
thousands on May 5 and 6, 1864.Artillery, of which Grant had a
superabundance, was well-nigh useless, wreaking its impotent fury upon the
defenseless trees.Even the efficacy of musketry fire was hampered.Men
tripping and falling in the tangled underbrush arose bleeding from the
briars to struggle with an adversary whose every movement was impeded
also.The cold steel of the bayonet finished the work which rifles had
begun.In the terrible turmoil of death the hopes of both Grant and Lee
were doomed to disappointment.Lee,
disregarding his own safety, endeavored to rally the disordered ranks of
A. P. Hill, and could only be persuaded to retire by the pledge of
Longstreet that his advancing force would win the coveted victory.Falling
upon Hancock's flank, the fresh troops seemed about to crush the Second
Corps, as Jackson's men had crushed the Eleventh the previous year at
Chancellorsville.But now, as Jackson, at the critical moment, had fallen
by the fire of his own men, so Longstreet and his staff, galloping along
the plank road, were mistaken by their own soldiers for Federals and fired
upon.A minie-ball struck Longstreet in the shoulder, and he was carried
from the field, feebly waving his hat that his men might know that he was
not killed.With him departed from the field the life of the attack.[Illustration: A LOSS IN "EFFECTIVE STRENGTH"--WOUNDED AT FREDERICKSBURG

those uninhabited thickets.There many of them died alone, and some
perished in the horror of a forest fire on the night of May 5th.The
Federals lost many gallant officers, among them the veteran Wadsworth.The
Confederates lost Generals Jenkins and Jones, killed, and suffered a
staggering blow in the disabling of Longstreet.The series of battles of
the Wilderness and Spotsylvania campaigns were more costly to the Federals
than Antietam and Gettysburg combined.[Illustration: ONE OF GRANT'S FIELD-TELEGRAPH STATIONS IN 1864

excellent idea of the difficulties under which telegraphing was done at
the front or on the march.With a tent-fly for shelter and a hard-tack box
for a table, the resourceful operator mounted his "relay," tested his
wire, and brought the commanding general into direct communication with
separated brigades or divisions.The U. S. Military Telegraph Corps,
through its Superintendent of Construction, Dennis Doren, kept Meade and
both wings of his army in communication from the crossing of the Rapidan
in May, 1864, till the siege of Petersburg.Over this field-line Grant
received daily reports from four separate armies, numbering a quarter of a
million men, and replied with daily directions for their operations over
an area of seven hundred and fifty thousand square miles.Though every
corps of Meade's army moved daily, Doren kept them in touch with
headquarters.The field-line was built of seven twisted, rubber-coated
wires which were hastily strung on trees or fences.TELEGRAPHING FOR THE ARMIES

The man who established the Federal military telegraph system amid the
first horrors of war was to become one of the world's foremost advocates
of peace.As the right hand man of Thomas A. Scott, Assistant Secretary of
War, he came to Washington in '61, and was immediately put in charge of
the field work of reestablishing communication between the Capital and the
North, cut off by the Maryland mobs.A telegraph operator himself, he
inaugurated the system of cipher despatches for the War Department and
secured the trusted operators with whom the service was begun.A young man
of twenty-four at the time, he was one of the last to leave the
battlefield of Bull Run, and his duties of general superintendence over
the network of railroads and telegraph lines made him a witness of war's
cruelties on other fields until he with his chief left the government
service June 1, 1862.THE MILITARY FIELD TELEGRAPH

"No orders ever had to be given to establish the telegraph."Thus wrote
General Grant in his memoirs."The moment troops were in position to go
into camp, the men would put up their wires."Grant pays a glowing tribute
to "the organization and discipline of this body of brave and intelligent
men."[Illustration: THE ARMY SAVING THE NAVY IN MAY, 1864

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.][Illustration]

Here the army is saving the navy by a brilliant piece of engineering that
prevented the loss of a fleet worth $2,000,000.The Red River expedition
was one of the most humiliating ever undertaken by the Federals.Porter's
fleet, which had so boldly advanced above the falls at Alexandria, was
ordered back, only to find that the river was so low as to imprison twelve
vessels.Lieut.-Colonel Joseph Bailey, acting engineer of the Nineteenth
Corps, obtained permission to build a dam in order to make possible the
passage of the fleet.Begun on April 30, 1864, the work was finished on
the 8th of May, almost entirely by the soldiers, working incessantly day
and night, often up to their necks in water and under the broiling sun.Bailey succeeded in turning the whole current into one channel and the
squadron passed below to safety.Not often have inland lumbermen been the
means of saving a navy.[Illustration: COLONEL JOSEPH BAILEY IN 1864.THE MAN WHO SAVED THE FLEET.]The army engineers laughed at this wide-browed, unassuming man when he
suggested building a dam so as to release Admiral Porter's fleet
imprisoned by low water above the Falls at Alexandria at the close of the
futile Red River expedition in 1864.Bailey had been a lumberman in
Wisconsin and had there gained the practical experience which taught him
that the plan was feasible.He was Acting Chief Engineer of the Nineteenth
Army Corps at this time, and obtained permission to go ahead and build his
dam.In the undertaking he had the approval and earnest support of Admiral
Porter, who refused to consider for a moment the abandonment of any of his
vessels even though the Red River expedition had been ordered to return
and General Banks was chafing at delay and sending messages to Porter that
his troops must be got in motion at once.Bailey pushed on with his work and in eleven days he succeeded in so
raising the water in the channel that all the Federal vessels were able to
pass down below the Falls."Words are inadequate," said Admiral Porter, in
his report, "to express the admiration I feel for the ability of Lieut.This is without doubt the best engineering feat ever
performed.... The highest honors the Government can bestow on Colonel
Bailey can never repay him for the service he has rendered the country."For this achievement Bailey was promoted to colonel, brevetted brigadier
general, voted the thanks of Congress, and presented with a sword and a
purse of $3,000 by the officers of Porter's fleet.He settled in Missouri
after the war and was a formidable enemy of the "Bushwhackers" till he was
shot by them on March 21, 1867.He was born at Salem, Ohio, April 28,
1827.[Illustration: READY FOR HER BAPTISM.COPYRIGHT BY REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This powerful gunboat, the _Lafayette_, though accompanying Admiral Porter
on the Red River expedition, was not one of those entrapped at Alexandria.Her heavy draft precluded her being taken above the Falls.Here we see her
lying above Vicksburg in the spring of 1863.She and her sister ship, the
_Choctaw_, were side-wheel steamers altered into casemate ironclads with
rams.The _Lafayette_ had the stronger armament, carrying two 11-inch
Dahlgrens forward, four 9-inch guns in the broadside, and two 24-pound
howitzers, with two 100-pound Parrott guns astern.She and the _Choctaw_
were the most important acquisitions to Porter's fleet toward the end of
1862.The _Lafayette_ was built and armed for heavy fighting.She got her
first taste of it on the night of April 16, 1863, when Porter took part of
his fleet past the Vicksburg batteries to support Grant's crossing of the
river in an advance on Vicksburg from below.The Lafayette, with a barge
and a transport lashed to her, held her course with difficulty through the
tornado of shot and shell which poured from the Confederate batteries on
the river front in Vicksburg as soon as the movement was discovered.The
_Lafayette_ stood up to this fiery christening and successfully ran the
gantlet, as did all the other vessels save one transport.She was
commanded during the Red River expedition by Lieutenant-Commander J. P.
Foster.[Illustration: FARRAGUT AT THE PINNACLE OF HIS FAME

the southward he was regarded as utterly foolhardy.All that was needed,
however, to make Fox's plan successful was the man with spirit enough to
undertake it and judgment sufficient to carry it out.Here on the deck of
the fine new sloop-of-war that had been assigned to him as flagship,
stands the man who had just accomplished a greater feat that made him a
world figure as famous as Nelson.The Confederacy had found its great
general among its own people, but the great admiral of the war, although
of Southern birth, had refused to fight against the flag for which, as a
boy in the War of 1812, he had seen men die.Full of the fighting spirit
of the old navy, he was able to achieve the first great victory that gave
new hope to the Federal cause.Percival Drayton was also a Southerner, a
South Carolinian, whose brothers and uncles were fighting for the South.[Illustration: "FAR BY GRAY MORGAN'S WALLS"--THE MOBILE BAY FORT, BATTERED
BY FARRAGUT'S GUNS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]How formidable was Farragut's undertaking in forcing his way into Mobile
Bay is apparent from these photographs.For wooden vessels to pass Morgan
and Gaines, two of the strongest forts on the coast, was pronounced by
experts most foolhardy.Besides, the channel was planted with torpedoes
that might blow the ships to atoms, and within the bay was the Confederate
ram _Tennessee_, thought to be the most powerful ironclad ever put afloat.In the arrangements for the attack, Farragut's flagship, the _Hartford_,
was placed second, the _Brooklyn_ leading the line of battleships, which
were preceded by four monitors.At a quarter before six, on the morning of
August 5th, the fleet moved.Half an hour later it came within range of
Fort Morgan.The
monitor _Tecumseh_, eager to engage the Confederate ram _Tennessee_ behind
the line of torpedoes, ran straight ahead, struck a torpedo, and in a few
minutes went down with most of the crew.As the monitor sank, the
_Brooklyn_ recoiled.Farragut signaled: "What's the trouble?""Torpedoes,"
was the answer."Go ahead, Captain
Drayton.Finding that the smoke from the guns obstructed the
view from the deck, Farragut ascended to the rigging of the main mast,
where he was in great danger of being struck and of falling to the deck.The captain accordingly ordered a quartermaster to tie him in the shrouds.The _Hartford_, under a full head of steam, rushed over the torpedo ground
far in advance of the fleet.The Confederate
ram, invulnerable to the broadsides of the Union guns, steamed alone for
the ships, while the ramparts of the two forts were crowded with
spectators of the coming conflict.The ironclad monster made straight for
the flagship, attempting to ram it and paying no attention to the fire or
the ramming of the other vessels.Its first effort was unsuccessful, but a
second came near proving fatal.It then became a target for the whole
Union fleet; finally its rudder-chain was shot away and it became
unmanageable; in a few minutes it raised the white flag.No wonder
Americans call Farragut the greatest of naval commanders.[Illustration: WHERE BROADSIDES STRUCK]

she steamed in line to the attack of Fort Morgan at Mobile Bay on the
morning of August 5, 1864.Every man was at his station thinking his own
thoughts in the suspense of that moment.On the quarterdeck stood Captain
Percival Drayton and his staff.Near them was the chief-quartermaster,
John H. Knowles, ready to hoist the signals that would convey Farragut's
orders to the fleet.The admiral himself was in the port main shrouds
twenty-five feet above the deck.All was silence aboard till the
"Hartford" was in easy range of the fort.Then the great broadsides of the
old ship began to take their part in the awful cannonade.During the early
part of the action Captain Drayton, fearing that some damage to the
rigging might pitch Farragut overboard, sent Knowles on his famous
mission."I went up," said the old sailor, "with a piece of lead line and
made it fast to one of the forward shrouds, and then took it around the
admiral to the after shroud, making it fast there.The admiral said,
'Never mind, I'm all right,' but I went ahead and obeyed orders."Later
Farragut, undoing the lashing with his own hands, climbed higher still.[Illustration: QUARTERMASTER KNOWLES]

amazing courage and skill; the rapidity and accuracy of their fire was
rarely equalled in the war.In the terrible conflict the "Hartford" was
struck twenty times, the "Brooklyn" thirty, the "Octorora" seventeen, the
"Metacomet" eleven, the "Lackawanna" five, the "Ossipee" four, the
"Monongahela" five, the "Kennebec" two, and the "Galena" seven.Of the
monitors the "Chickasaw" was struck three times, the "Manhattan" nine, and
the "Winnebago" nineteen.The total loss in the Federal fleet was 52
killed and 170 wounded, while on the Confederate gunboats 12 were killed
and 20 wounded.The night after the battle the "Metacomet" was turned into
a hospital ship and the wounded of both sides were taken to Pensacola.The
pilot of the captured "Tennessee" guided the Federal ship through the
torpedoes, and as she was leaving Pensacola on her return trip Midshipman
Carter of the "Tennessee," who also was on the "Metacomet," called out
from the wharf: "Don't attempt to fire No.2 gun (of the "Tennessee"), as
there is a shell jammed in the bore, and the gun will burst and kill some
one."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.][Illustration: THE BRAVEST OF THE BRAVE--THE CONFEDERATE IRONCLAD RAM
"TENNESSEE"

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Mobile Bay, on the morning of August 5, 1864, was the arena of more
conspicuous heroism than marked any naval battle-ground of the entire war.Among all the daring deeds of that day stands out superlatively the
gallant manner in which Admiral Franklin Buchanan, C. S. N., fought his
vessel, the "Tennessee.""You shall not have it to say when you leave this
vessel that you were not near enough to the enemy, for I will meet them,
and then you can fight them alongside of their own ships; and if I fall,
lay me on one side and go on with the fight."Thus Buchanan addressed his
men, and then, taking his station in the pilot-house, he took his vessel
into action.The Federal fleet carried more power for destruction than the
combined English, French, and Spanish fleets at Trafalgar, and yet
Buchanan made good his boast that he would fight alongside.No sooner had
Farragut crossed the torpedoes than Buchanan matched that deed, running
through the entire line of Federal vessels, braving their broadsides, and
coming to close quarters with most of them.Then the "Tennessee" ran under
the guns of Fort Morgan for a breathing space.In half an hour she was
steaming up the bay to fight the entire squadron single-handed.Such
boldness was scarce believable, for Buchanan had now not alone wooden
ships to contend with, as when in the "Merrimac" he had dismayed the
Federals in Hampton Roads.Three powerful monitors were to oppose him at
point-blank range.For nearly an hour the gunners in the "Tennessee"
fought, breathing powder-smoke amid an atmosphere superheated to 120
degrees.Buchanan was serving a gun himself when he was wounded and
carried to the surgeon's table below.Captain Johnston fought on for
another twenty minutes, and then the "Tennessee," with her rudder and
engines useless and unable to fire a gun, was surrendered, after a
reluctant consent had been wrung from Buchanan, as he lay on the operating
table.[Illustration]

  Detroit, Mich., U. S. A._]




THE BATTLE OF SPOTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE

    But to Spotsylvania history will accord the palm, I am sure, for
    having furnished an unexampled muzzle-to-muzzle fire; the longest roll
    of incessant, unbroken musketry; the most splendid exhibition of
    individual heroism and personal daring by large numbers, who, standing
    in the freshly spilt blood of their fellows, faced for so long a
    period and at so short a range the flaming rifles as they heralded the
    decrees of death.It was
    exhibited by both armies, and in that hand-to-hand struggle for the
    possession of the breastworks it seemed almost universal.It would be
    commonplace truism to say that such examples will not be lost to the
    Republic.--_General John B. Gordon, C. S. A., in "Reminiscences of the
    Civil War."_


Immediately after the cessation of hostilities on the 6th of May in the
Wilderness, Grant determined to move his army to Spotsylvania Court House,
and to start the wagon trains on the afternoon of the 7th.Grant's object
was, by a flank move, to get between Lee and Richmond.Lee foresaw Grant's
purpose and also moved his cavalry, under Stuart, across the opponent's
path.As an illustration of the exact science of war we see the two great
military leaders racing for position at Spotsylvania Court House.It was
revealed later that Lee had already made preparations on this field a year
before, in anticipation of its being a possible battle-ground.Apprised of the movement of the Federal trains, Lee, with his usual
sagacious foresight, surmised their destination.He therefore ordered
General R. H. Anderson, now in command of Longstreet's corps, to march to
Spotsylvania Court House at three o'clock on the morning of the 8th.But
the smoke and flames from the burning forests that surrounded Anderson's
camp in the Wilderness made the position untenable, and the march was
begun at eleven o'clock on the night of the 7th.This early start proved
of inestimable value to the Confederates.Anderson's right, in the
Wilderness, rested opposite Hancock's left, and the Confederates secured a
more direct line of march to Spotsylvania, several miles shorter than that
of the Federals.The same night General Ewell at the extreme Confederate
left was ordered to follow Anderson at daylight, if he found no large
force in his front.This order was followed out, there being no opposing
troops, and the corps took the longest route of any of Lee's troops.General Ewell found the march exhausting and distressing on account of the
intense heat and dust and smoke from the burning forests.The Federal move toward Spotsylvania Court House was begun after dark on
the 7th.Warren's corps, in the lead, took the Brock road behind Hancock's
position and was followed by Sedgwick, who marched by way of
Chancellorsville.Burnside came next, but he was halted to guard the
trains.Hancock, covering the move, did not start the head of his command
until some time after daylight.When Warren reached Todd's Tavern he found
the Union cavalry under Merritt in conflict with Fitzhugh Lee's division
of Stuart's cavalry.Warren sent Robinson's division ahead; it drove
Fitzhugh Lee back, and, advancing rapidly, met the head of Anderson's
troops.The leading brigades came to the assistance of the cavalry; Warren
was finally repulsed and began entrenching.The Confederates gained
Spotsylvania Court House.Throughout the day there was continual skirmishing between the troops, as
the Northerners attempted to break the line of the Confederates.Every advance of the blue was repulsed.Lee again
blocked the way of Grant's move.The Federal loss during the day had been
about thirteen hundred, while the Confederates lost fewer men than their
opponents.The work of both was now the construction of entrenchments, which
consisted of earthworks sloping to either side, with logs as a parapet,
and between these works and the opposing army were constructed what are
known as abatis, felled trees, with the branches cut off, the sharp ends
projecting toward the approaching forces.Lee's entrenchments were of such character as to increase the efficiency
of his force.They were formed in the shape of a huge V with the apex
flattened, forming a salient angle against the center of the Federal line.The Confederate lines were facing north, northwest, and northeast, the
corps commanded by Anderson on the left, Ewell in the center, and Early on
the right, the latter temporarily replacing A. P. Hill, who was ill.The
Federals confronting them were Burnside on the left, Sedgwick and Warren
in the center, and Hancock on the right.The day of the 9th was spent in placing the lines of troops, with no
fighting except skirmishing and some sharp-shooting.While placing some
field-pieces, General Sedgwick was hit by a sharpshooter's bullet and
instantly killed.He was a man of high character, a most competent
commander, of fearless courage, loved and lamented by the army.General
Horatio G. Wright succeeded to the command of the Sixth Corps.Early on the morning of the 10th, the Confederates discovered that Hancock
had crossed the Po River in front of his position of the day before and
was threatening their rear.Grant had suspected that Lee was about to move
north toward Fredericksburg, and Hancock had been ordered to make a
reconnaissance with a view to attacking and turning the Confederate left.But difficulties stood in the way of Hancock's performance, and before he
had accomplished much, Meade directed him to send two of his divisions to
assist Warren in making an attack on the Southern lines.The Second Corps
started to recross the Po.Before all were over Early made a vigorous
assault on the rear division, which did not escape without heavy loss.In
this engagement the corps lost the first gun in its most honorable career,
a misfortune deeply lamented by every man in the corps, since up to this
moment it had long been the only one in the entire army which could make
the proud claim of never having lost a gun or a color.But the great event of the 10th was the direct assault upon the
Confederate front.Meade had arranged for Hancock to take charge of this,
and the appointed hour was five in the afternoon.But Warren reported
earlier that the opportunity was most favorable, and he was ordered to
start at once.Wearing his full uniform, the leader of the Fifth Corps
advanced at a quarter to four with the greater portion of his troops.The
progress of the valiant Northerners was one of the greatest difficulty,
owing to the dense wood of low cedar-trees through which they had to make
their way.Longstreet's corps behind their entrenchments acknowledged the
advance with very heavy artillery and musket fire.But Warren's troops did
not falter or pause until some had reached the abatis and others the very
crest of the parapet.A few, indeed, were actually killed inside the
works.All, however, who survived the terrible ordeal were finally driven
back with heavy loss.General James C. Rice was mortally wounded.To the left of Warren, General Wright had observed what he believed to be
a vulnerable spot in the Confederate entrenchments.Behind this particular
place was stationed Doles' brigade of Georgia regiments, and Colonel Emory
Upton was ordered to charge Doles with a column of twelve regiments in
four lines.The ceasing of the Federal artillery at six o'clock was the
signal for the charge, and twenty minutes later, as Upton tells us, "at
command, the lines rose, moved noiselessly to the edge of the wood, and
then, with a wild cheer and faces averted, rushed for the works.Through a
terrible front and flank fire the column advanced quickly, gaining the
parapet.Here occurred a deadly hand-to-hand conflict.The enemy, sitting
in their pits with pieces upright, loaded, and with bayonets fixed ready
to impale the first who should leap over, absolutely refused to yield the
ground.The first of our men who tried to surmount the works fell, pierced
through the head by musket-balls.Others, seeing the fate of their
comrades, held their pieces at arm's length and fired downward, while
others, poising their pieces vertically, hurled them down upon their
enemy, pinning them to the ground.... The struggle lasted but a few
seconds.Numbers prevailed, and like a resistless wave, the column poured
over the works, quickly putting _hors de combat_ those who resisted and
sending to the rear those who surrendered.Pressing forward and expanding
to the right and left, the second line of entrenchments, its line of
battle, and a battery fell into our hands.The column of assault had
accomplished its task."The Confederate line had been shattered and an opening made for expected
support.General Mott, on the left, did
not bring his division forward as had been planned and as General Wright
had ordered.The Confederates were reenforced, and Upton could do no more
than hold the captured entrenchments until ordered to retire.He brought
twelve hundred prisoners and several stands of colors back to the Union
lines; but over a thousand of his own men were killed or wounded.For
gallantry displayed in this charge, Colonel Upton was made
brigadier-general.The losses to the Union army in this engagement at Spotsylvania were over
four thousand.The loss to the Confederates was probably two thousand.The two giant antagonists took a
breathing spell.It was on the morning of this date that Grant penned the
sentence, "I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer,"
to his chief of staff, General Halleck.During this time Sheridan, who had brought the cavalry up to a state of
great efficiency, was making an expedition to the vicinity of Richmond.He
had said that if he were permitted to operate independently of the army he
would draw Stuart after him.Grant at once gave the order, and Sheridan
made a detour around Lee's army, engaging and defeating the Confederate
cavalry, which he greatly outnumbered, on the 11th of May, at Yellow
Tavern, where General Stuart, the brilliant commander of the Confederate
cavalry, was mortally wounded.Grant carefully went over the ground and decided upon another attack on
the 12th.About four hundred yards of clear ground lay in front of the
sharp angle, or salient, of Lee's lines.After the battle this point was
known as the "Bloody Angle," and also as "Hell's Hole."Here Hancock was
ordered to make an attack at daybreak on the 12th.Lee had been expecting
a move on the part of Grant.On the evening of the 10th he sent to Ewell
this message: "It will be necessary for you to reestablish your whole line
to-night.... Perhaps Grant will make a night attack, as it was a favorite
amusement of his at Vicksburg."Through rain and mud Hancock's force was gotten into position within a few
hundred yards of the Confederate breastworks.He was now between Burnside
and Wright.At the first approach of dawn the four divisions of the Second
Corps, under Birney, Mott, Barlow, and Gibbon (in reserve) moved
noiselessly to the designated point of attack.Without a shot being fired
they reached the Confederate entrenchments, and struck with fury and
impetuosity a mortal blow at the point where least expected, on the
salient, held by General Edward Johnson of Ewell's corps.The movement of
the Federals was so swift and the surprise so complete, that the
Confederates could make practically no resistance, and were forced to
surrender.The artillery had been withdrawn from the earthworks occupied by Johnson's
troops on the previous night, but developments had led to an order to
have it returned early in the morning.It was approaching as the attack
was made.Before the artillerymen could escape or turn the guns upon the
Federals, every cannon had been captured.General Johnson with almost his
whole division, numbering about three thousand, and General Steuart, were
captured, between twenty and thirty colors, and several thousand stands of
arms were taken.Hancock had already distinguished himself as a leader of
his soldiers, and from his magnificent appearance, noble bearing, and
courage had been called "Hancock the Superb," but this was the most
brilliant of his military achievements.Pressing onward across the first defensive line of the Confederates,
Hancock's men advanced against the second series of trenches, nearly half
a mile beyond.As the Federals pushed through the muddy fields they lost
all formation.The Southerners
were prepared for the attack.A volley poured into the throng of blue, and
General Gordon with his reserve division rushed forward, fighting
desperately to drive the Northerners back.As they did so General Lee rode
up, evidently intending to go forward with Gordon.His horse was seized by
one of the soldiers, and for the second time in the campaign the cry arose
from the ranks, "Lee to the rear!"The beloved commander was led back from
the range of fire, while the men, under the inspiration of his example,
rushed forward in a charge that drove the Federals back until they had
reached the outer line of works.Here they fought stubbornly at deadly
range.Neither side was able to force the other back.But Gordon was not
able to cope with the entire attack.Wright and Warren both sent some of
their divisions to reenforce Hancock, and Lee sent all the assistance
possible to the troops struggling so desperately to restore his line at
the salient.Many vivid and picturesque descriptions of this fighting at the angle have
been written, some by eye-witnesses, others by able historians, but no
printed page, no cold type can convey to the mind the realities of that
terrible conflict.The whole engagement was
practically a hand-to-hand contest.The dead lay beneath the feet of the
living, three and four layers deep.This hitherto quiet spot of earth was
devastated and covered with the slain, weltering in their own blood,
mangled and shattered into scarcely a semblance of human form.Dying men
were crushed by horses and many, buried beneath the mire and mud, still
lived.Some artillery was posted on high ground not far from the apex of
the salient, and an incessant fire was poured into the Confederate works
over the Union lines, while other guns kept up an enfilade of canister
along the west of the salient.The contest from the right of the Sixth to the left of the Second Corps
was kept up throughout the day along the whole line.Repeatedly the
trenches had to be cleared of the dead.An oak tree twenty-two inches in
diameter was cut down by musket-balls.Men leaped upon the breastworks,
firing until shot down.The battle of the "angle" is said to have been the most awful in duration
and intensity in modern times.Battle-line after battle-line, bravely
obeying orders, was annihilated.The entrenchments were shivered and
shattered, trunks of trees carved into split brooms.Sometimes the
contestants came so close together that their muskets met, muzzle to
muzzle, and their flags almost intertwined with each other as they waved
in the breeze.As they fought with the desperation of madmen, the living
would stand on the bodies of the dead to reach over the breastworks with
their weapons of slaughter.Lee hurled his army with unparalleled vigor
against his opponent five times during the day, but each time was
repulsed.Until three o'clock the next morning the slaughter continued,
when the Confederates sank back into their second line of entrenchments,
leaving their opponents where they had stood in the morning.All the
fighting on the 12th was not done at the "Bloody Angle."Burnside on the
left of Hancock engaged Early's troops and was defeated, while on the
other side of the salient Wright succeeded in driving Anderson back.The question has naturally arisen why that "salient" was regarded of such
vital importance as to induce the two chief commanders to force their
armies into such a hand-to-hand contest that must inevitably result in
unparalleled and wholesale slaughter.It was manifest, however, that Grant
had shown generalship in finding the weak point in Lee's line for attack.It was imperative that he hold the gain made by his troops.Lee could ill
afford the loss resistance would entail, but he could not withdraw his
army during the day without disaster.The men on both sides seemed to comprehend the gravity of the situation,
that it was a battle to the death for that little point of entrenchment.Without urging by officers, and sometimes without officers, they fell into
line and fought and bled and died in myriads as though inspired by some
unseen power.Here men rushed to their doom with shouts of courage and
eagerness.The pity of it all was manifested by the shocking scene on that
battlefield the next day.Piles of dead lay around the "Bloody Angle," a
veritable "Hell's Hole" on both sides of the entrenchments, four layers
deep in places, shattered and torn by bullets and hoofs and clubbed
muskets, while beneath the layers of dead, it is said, there could be seen
quivering limbs of those who still lived.General Grant was deeply moved at the terrible loss of life.When he
expressed his regret for the heavy sacrifice of men to General Meade, the
latter replied, "General, we can't do these little tricks without heavy
losses."The total loss to the Union army in killed, wounded, and missing
at Spotsylvania was nearly eighteen thousand.The Confederate losses have
never been positively known, but from the best available sources of
information the number has been placed at not less than nine thousand men.Lee's loss in high officers was very severe, the killed including General
Daniel and General Perrin, while Generals Walker, Ramseur, R. D. Johnston,
and McGowan were severely wounded.In addition to the loss of these
important commanders, Lee was further crippled in efficient commanders by
the capture of Generals Edward Johnson and Steuart.The Union loss in high
officers was light, excepting General Sedgwick on the 9th.General Webb
was wounded, and Colonel <DW53>, of the Second Corps, was killed.Lee's forces had been handled with such consummate skill as to make them
count one almost for two, and there was the spirit of devotion for Lee
among his soldiers which was indeed practically hero-worship.All in all,
he had an army, though shattered and worn, that was almost unconquerable.Grant found that ordinary methods of war, even such as he had experienced
in the West, were not applicable to the Army of Northern Virginia.The
only hope for the Union army was a long-drawn-out process, and with larger
numbers, better kept, and more often relieved, Grant's army would
ultimately make that of Lee's succumb, from sheer exhaustion and
disintegration.The battle was not terminated on the 12th.During the next five days there
was a continuous movement of the Union corps to the east which was met by
a corresponding readjustment of the Confederate lines.After various
maneuvers, Hancock was ordered to the point where the battle was fought on
the 12th, and on the 18th and 19th, the last effort was made to break the
lines of the Confederates.Ewell, however, drove the Federals back and the
next day he had a severe engagement with the Union left wing, while
endeavoring to find out something of Grant's plans.Twelve days of active effort were thus spent in skirmishing, fighting, and
countermarching.In the last two engagements the Union losses were nearly
two thousand, which are included in those before stated.It was decided to
abandon the attempt to dislodge Lee from his entrenchments, and to move
to the North Anna River.On the 20th of May the march was resumed.The men
had suffered great hardships from hunger, exposure, and incessant action,
and many would fall asleep on the line of march.On the day after the start, Hancock crossed the Mattapony River at one
point and Warren at another.Hancock was ordered to take position on the
right bank and, if practicable, to attack the Confederates wherever found.By the 22d, Wright and Burnside came up and the march proceeded.But the
vigilant Lee had again detected the plans of his adversary.Meade's army had barely started in its purpose to turn the Confederates'
flank when the Southern forces were on the way to block the army of the
North.As on the march from the Wilderness to Spotsylvania, Lee's troops
took the shorter route, along main roads, and reached the North Anna ahead
of the Federals.Warren's corps was the first of Meade's army to arrive at
the north bank of the river, which it did on the afternoon of May 23d.Lee
was already on the south bank, but Warren crossed without opposition.No
sooner had he gotten over, however, than he was attacked by the
Confederates and a severe but undecisive engagement followed.The next
morning (the 24th) Hancock and Wright put their troops across at places
some miles apart, and before these two wings of the army could be joined,
Lee made a brilliant stroke by marching in between them, forming a wedge
whose point rested on the bank, opposite the Union center, under Burnside,
which had not yet crossed the river.The Army of the Potomac was now in three badly separated parts.Burnside
could not get over in sufficient strength to reenforce the wings, and all
attempts by the latter to aid him in so doing met with considerable
disaster.The loss in these engagements approximated two thousand on each
side.On the 25th, Sheridan and his cavalry rejoined the army.They had been
gone since the 9th and their raid was most successful.Besides the
decisive victory over the Confederate cavalry at Yellow Tavern, they had
destroyed several depots of supplies, four trains of cars, and many miles
of railroad track.Nearly four hundred Federal prisoners on their way to
Richmond had been rescued from their captors.The dashing cavalrymen had
even carried the first line of work around Richmond, and had made a detour
down the James to communicate with General Butler.Grant was highly
satisfied with Sheridan's performance.It had been of the greatest
assistance to him, as it had drawn off the whole of the Confederate
cavalry, and made the guarding of the wagon trains an easy matter.But here, on the banks of the North Anna, Grant had been completely
checkmated by Lee.He realized this and decided on a new move, although he
still clung to his idea of turning the Confederate right.The Federal
wings were withdrawn to the north side of the river during the night of
May 26th and the whole set in motion for the Pamunkey River at
Hanovertown.Two divisions of Sheridan's cavalry and Warren's corps were
in advance.Lee lost no time in pursuing his great antagonist, but for the
first time the latter was able to hold his lead.Along the Totopotomoy, on
the afternoon of May 28th, infantry and cavalry of both armies met in a
severe engagement in which the strong position of Lee's troops again
foiled Grant's purpose.The Union would have to try at some other point,
and on the 31st Sheridan's cavalry took possession of Cold Harbor.This
was to be the next battle-ground.[Illustration: IN THE AUTUMN OF 1863--GRANT'S CHANGING EXPRESSIONS]

Although secure in his fame as the conqueror of Vicksburg, Grant still has
the greater part of his destiny to fulfil as he faces the camera.Before
him lie the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, and the slow investment
of Petersburg.This series forms a particularly interesting study in
expression.At the left hand, the face looks almost amused.In the next
the expression is graver, the mouth close set.The third picture looks
plainly obstinate, and in the last the stern fighter might have been
declaring, as in the following spring: "I propose to fight it out on this
line if it takes all summer."The eyes, first unveiled fully in this
fourth view, are the unmistakable index to Grant's stern inflexibility,
once his decision was made.[Illustration: IN THE AUTUMN OF 1864--AFTER THE STRAIN OF THE WILDERNESS
CAMPAIGN]

Here is a furrowed brow above eyes worn by pain.In the pictures of the
previous year the forehead is more smooth, the expression grave yet
confident.Here the expression is that of a man who has won, but won at a
bitter cost.It is the memory of the 50,000 men whom he left in the
Wilderness campaign and at Cold Harbor that has lined this brow, and
closed still tighter this inflexible mouth.Again, as in the series above,
the eyes are not revealed until the last picture.Then again flashes the
determination of a hero.The great general's biographers say that Grant
was a man of sympathy and infinite pity.It was the more difficult for
him, spurred on to the duty by grim necessity, to order forward the lines
in blue that withered, again and again, before the Confederate fire, but
each time weakened the attenuated line which confronted them.[Illustration: MEADE AND SEDGWICK--BEFORE THE ADVANCE THAT BROUGHT

John Sedgwick, commanding the Sixth Army Corps.He wears his familiar
round hat and is smiling.He was a great tease; evidently the performances
of the civilian who had brought his new-fangled photographic apparatus
into camp suggested a joke.A couple of months later, on the 9th of May,
Sedgwick again was jesting--before Spotsylvania Court House.McMahon of
his staff had begged him to avoid passing some artillery exposed to the
Confederate fire, to which Sedgwick had playfully replied, "McMahon, I
would like to know who commands this corps, you or I?"Then he ordered
some infantry before him to shift toward the right.Their movement drew
the fire of the Confederates.The lines were close together; the situation
tense.A sharpshooter's bullet whistled--Sedgwick fell.He was taken to
Meade's headquarters.The Army of the Potomac had lost another corps
commander, and the Union a brilliant and courageous soldier.[Illustration: SPOTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE

WHERE GRANT WANTED TO "FIGHT IT OUT"

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]For miles around this quaint old village-pump surged the lines of two vast
contending armies, May 8-12, 1864.In this picture of only a few months
later, the inhabitants have returned to their accustomed quiet, although
the reverberations of battle have hardly died away.But on May 7th
Generals Grant and Meade, with their staffs, had started toward the little
courthouse.As they passed along the Brock Road in the rear of Hancock's
lines, the men broke into loud hurrahs.They saw that the movement was
still to be southward.But chance had caused Lee to choose the same
objective.Misinterpreting Grant's movement as a retreat upon
Fredericksburg, he sent Longstreet's corps, now commanded by Anderson, to
Spotsylvania.Chance again, in the form of a forest fire, drove Anderson
to make, on the night of May 7th, the march from the Wilderness that he
had been ordered to commence on the morning of the 8th.On that day, while
Warren was contending with the forces of Anderson, Lee's whole army was
entrenching on a ridge around Spotsylvania Court House."Accident," says
Grant, "often decides the fate of battle."But this "accident" was one of
Lee's master moves.[Illustration: THE APEX OF THE BATTLEFIELD

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]McCool's house, within the "Bloody Angle."The photographs were taken in
1864, shortly after the struggle of Spotsylvania Court House, and show the
old dwelling as it was on May 12th, when the fighting was at flood tide
all round it; and below, the Confederate entrenchments near that
blood-drenched spot.At a point in these Confederate lines in advance of
the McCool house, the entrenchments had been thrown forward like the
salient of a fort, and the wedge-shaped space within them was destined to
become renowned as the "Bloody Angle."The position was defended by the
famous "Stonewall Division" of the Confederates under command of General
Edward Johnson.It was near the scene of Upton's gallant charge on the
10th.Here at daybreak on May 12th the divisions of the intrepid Barlow
and Birney, sent forward by Hancock, stole a march upon the unsuspecting
Confederates.Leaping over the breastworks the Federals were upon them and
the first of the terrific hand-to-hand conflicts that marked the day
began.It ended in victory for Hancock's men, into whose hands fell 20
cannon, 30 standards and 4,000 prisoners, "the best division in the
Confederate army."[Illustration: CONFEDERATE ENTRENCHMENTS NEAR "BLOODY ANGLE"]

Flushed with success, the Federals pressed on to Lee's second line of
works, where Wilcox's division of the Confederates held them until
reenforcements sent by Lee from Hill and Anderson drove them back.On the
Federal side the Sixth Corps, with Upton's brigade in the advance, was
hurried forward to hold the advantage gained.But Lee himself was on the
scene, and the men of the gallant Gordon's division, pausing long enough
to seize and turn his horse, with shouts of "General Lee in the rear,"
hurtled forward into the conflict.In five separate charges by the
Confederates the fighting came to close quarters.With bayonets, clubbed
muskets, swords and pistols, men fought within two feet of one another on
either side of the entrenchments at "Bloody Angle" till night at last left
it in possession of the Federals.None of the fighting near Spotsylvania
Court House was inglorious.On the 10th, after a day of strengthening
positions on both sides, young Colonel Emory Upton of the 121st New York,
led a storming party of twelve regiments into the strongest of the
Confederate entrenchments.For his bravery Grant made him a
brigadier-general on the field.[Illustration: UNION ARTILLERY MASSING FOR THE ADVANCE THAT EWELL'S ATTACK
DELAYED THAT SAME AFTERNOON

BEVERLY HOUSE, MAY 18, 1864

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The artillery massing in the meadow gives to this view the interest of an
impending tragedy.In the foreground the officers, servants, and orderlies
of the headquarters mess camp are waiting for the command to strike their
tents, pack the wagons, and move on.But at the very time this photograph
was taken they should have been miles away.Grant had issued orders the
day before that should have set these troops in motion.However, the
Confederate General Ewell had chosen the 18th to make an attack on the
right flank.It not only delayed the departure but forced a change in the
intended positions of the division as they had been contemplated by the
commander-in-chief.Beverly House is where General Warren pitched his
headquarters after Spotsylvania, and the spectator is looking toward the
battlefield that lies beyond the distant woods.After Ewell's attack,
Warren again found himself on the right flank, and at this very moment the
main body of the Federal army is passing in the rear of him.The costly
check at Spotsylvania, with its wonderful display of fighting on both
sides, had in its apparently fruitless results called for the display of
all Grant's gifts as a military leader.It takes but little imagination to
supply color to this photograph; it is full of it--full of the movement
and detail of war also.It is springtime; blossoms have just left the
trees and the whole country is green and smiling, but the earth is scarred
by thousands of trampling feet and hoof-prints.Ugly ditches cross the
landscape; the debris of an army marks its onsweep from one battlefield to
another.[Illustration: THE ONES WHO NEVER CAME BACK

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.These are some of the men for whom waiting women wept--the ones who never
came back.They belonged to Ewell's Corps, who attacked the Federal lines
so gallantly on May 18th.There may be some who will turn from this
picture with a shudder of horror, but it is no morbid curiosity that will
cause them to study it closely.If pictures such as this were familiar
everywhere there would soon be an end of war.We can realize money by
seeing it expressed in figures; we can realize distances by miles, but
some things in their true meaning can only be grasped and impressions
formed with the seeing eye.Visualizing only this small item of the awful
cost--the cost beside which money cuts no figure--an idea can be gained of
what war is.Here is a sermon in the cause of universal peace.The
handsome lad lying with outstretched arms and clinched fingers is a mute
plea.Death has not disfigured him--he lies in an attitude of relaxation
and composure.Perhaps in some Southern home this same face is pictured in
the old family album, alert and full of life and hope, and here is the
end.Does there not come to the mind the insistent question, "Why?"The
Federal soldiers standing in the picture are not thinking of all this, it
may be true, but had they meditated in the way that some may, as they gaze
at this record of death, it would be worth their while.One of the men is
apparently holding a sprig of blossoms in his hand.[Illustration: IN ONE LONG BURIAL TRENCH

Tyler's division to put under ground the men they slew in the sharp battle
of May 18th, and here they are near Mrs.Allsop's barn digging the trench
to hide the dreadful work of bullet and shot and shell.No feeling of
bitterness exists in moments such as these.What soldier in the party
knows but what it may be his turn next to lie beside other lumps of clay
and join his earth-mother in this same fashion in his turn.But men become
used to work of any kind, and these men digging up the warm spring soil,
when their labor is concluded, are neither oppressed nor nerve-shattered
by what they have seen and done.They have lost the power of experiencing
sensation.Senses become numbed in a measure; the value of life itself
from close and constant association with death is minimized almost to the
vanishing point.In half an hour these very men may be singing and
laughing as if war and death were only things to be expected, not reasoned
over in the least.[Illustration: ONE OF THE FEARLESS CONFEDERATES]


[Illustration: THE REDOUBT THAT LEE LET GO

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.This redoubt covered Taylor's Bridge, but its flanks were swept by
artillery and an enfilading fire from rifle-pits across the river.Late in
the evening of the 23d, Hancock's corps, arriving before the redoubt, had
assaulted it with two brigades and easily carried it.During the night the
Confederates from the other side made two attacks upon the bridge and
finally succeeded in setting it afire.The flames were extinguished by the
Federals, and on the 24th Hancock's troops crossed over without
opposition.The easy crossing of the Federals here was but another example
of Lee's favorite rule to let his antagonist attack him on the further
side of a stream.Taylor's Bridge could easily have been held by Lee for a
much longer time, but its ready abandonment was part of the tactics by
which Grant was being led into a military dilemma.In the picture the
Federal soldiers confidently hold the captured redoubt, convinced that the
possession of it meant that they had driven Lee to his last corner.[Illustration: "WALK YOUR HORSES"

ONE OF THE GRIM JOKES OF WAR AS PLAYED AT CHESTERFIELD BRIDGE, NORTH ANNA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The sign posted by the local authorities at Taylor's bridge, where the
Telegraph Road crosses the North Anna, was "Walk your horses."The wooden
structure was referred to by the military as Chesterfield bridge.Here
Hancock's Corps arrived toward evening of May 23d, and the Confederate
entrenchments, showing in the foreground, were seized by the old "Berry
Brigade."In the heat of the charge the Ninety-third New York carried
their colors to the middle of the bridge, driving off the Confederates
before they could destroy it.When the Federals began crossing next day
they had to run the gantlet of musketry and artillery fire from the
opposite bank.Several regiments of New York heavy artillery poured across
the structure at the double-quick with the hostile shells bursting about
their heads.When Captain Sleeper's Eighteenth Massachusetts battery began
crossing, the Confederate cannoneers redoubled their efforts to blow up
the ammunition by well-aimed shots.Sleeper passed over only one piece at
a time in order to diminish the target and enforce the observance of the
local law by walking his horses!The Second Corps got no further than the
ridge beyond, where Lee's strong V formation held it from further
advance.[Illustration: A SANITARY-COMMISSION NURSE AND HER PATIENTS AT

terrible Wilderness campaign.The Sanitary Commission is visiting the
field hospital established near the Rappahannock River, a mile or so from
the heights, where lay at the same time the wounded from these terrific
conflicts.Although the work of this Commission was only supplementary
after 1862, they continued to supply many delicacies, and luxuries such as
crutches, which did not form part of the regular medical corps
paraphernalia.The effect of their work can be seen here, and also the
appearance of men after the shock of gunshot wounds.All injuries during
the war practically fell under three headings: incised and punctured
wounds, comprising saber cuts, bayonet stabs, and sword thrusts;
miscellaneous, from falls, blows from blunt weapons, and various
accidents; lastly, and chiefly, gunshot wounds.The war came prior to the
demonstration of the fact that the causes of disease and suppurative
conditions are living organisms of microscopic size.Septicemia,
erysipelas, lockjaw, and gangrene were variously attributed to dampness
and a multitude of other conditions.[Illustration: A CHANGE OF BASE--THE CAVALRY SCREEN

COPYRIGHT 1911 PATRIOT PUB.This photograph of May 30, 1864, shows the Federal cavalry in actual
operation of a most important function--the "screening" of the army's
movements.The troopers are guarding the evacuation of Port Royal on the
Rappahannock, May 30, 1864.After the reverse to the Union arms at
Spottsylvania, Grant ordered the change of base from the Rappahannock to
McClellan's former starting-point, White House on the Pamunkey.The
control of the waterways, combined with Sheridan's efficient use of the
cavalry, made this an easy matter.Torbert's division encountered Gordon's
brigade of Confederate cavalry at Hanovertown and drove it in the
direction of Hanover Court House.Gregg's division moved up to this line;
Russell's division of infantry encamped near the river-crossing in
support, and behind the mask thus formed the Army of the Potomac crossed
the Pamunkey on May 28th unimpeded.Gregg was then ordered to reconnoiter
towards Mechanicsville, and after a severe fight at Hawes' shop he
succeeded (with the assistance of Custer's brigade) in driving Hampton's
and Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry divisions and Butler's brigade from the field.Although the battle took place immediately in front of the Federal
infantry, General Meade declined to put the latter into action, and the
battle was won by the cavalry alone.COLD HARBOR

    Cold Harbor is, I think, the only battle I ever fought that I would
    not fight over again under the circumstances.I have always regretted
    that the last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made.--_General U. S.
    Grant in his "Memoirs."_


According to Grant's well-made plans of march, the various corps of the
Army of the Potomac set out from the banks of the North Anna on the night
of May 26, 1864, at the times and by the routes assigned to them.Early on
the morning of May 27th Lee set his force in motion by the Telegraph road
and such others as were available, across the Little and South Anna rivers
toward Ashland and Atlee's Station on the Virginia Central Railroad.Thus the armies were stretched like two live wires along the swampy
bottom-lands of eastern Virginia, and as they came in contact, here and
there along the line, there were the inevitable sputterings of flame and
considerable destruction wrought.The advance Federal infantry crossed the
Pamunkey, after the cavalry, at Hanoverstown, early on May 28th.The
Second Corps was close behind the Sixth; the Fifth was over by noon, while
the Ninth, now an integral portion of the Army of the Potomac, passed the
river by midnight.On the 31st General Sheridan reached Cold Harbor, which Meade had ordered
him to hold at all hazards.This place, probably named after the old home
of some English settler, was not a town but the meeting-place of several
roads of great strategic importance to the Federal army.They led not only
toward Richmond by the way of the upper Chickahominy bridges, but in the
direction of White House Landing, on the Pamunkey River.Both Lee and Meade had received reenforcements--the former by
Breckinridge, and the scattered forces in western Virginia, and by Pickett
and Hoke from North Carolina.From Bermuda Hundred where General Butler
was "bottled up"--to use a phrase which Grant employed and afterward
regretted--General W. F. Smith was ordered to bring the Eighteenth Corps
of the Army of the James to the assistance of Meade, since Butler could
defend his position perfectly well with a small force, and could make no
headway against Beauregard with a large one.Grant had now nearly one
hundred and fourteen thousand troops and Lee about eighty thousand.Sheridan's appearance at Cold Harbor was resented in vain by Fitzhugh Lee,
and the next morning, June 1st, the Sixth Corps arrived, followed by
General Smith and ten thousand men of the Eighteenth, who had hastened
from the landing-place at White House.These took position on the right of
the Sixth, and the Federal line was promptly faced by Longstreet's corps,
a part of A. P. Hill's, and the divisions of Hoke and Breckinridge.At six
o'clock in the afternoon Wright and Smith advanced to the attack, which
Hoke and Kershaw received with courage and determination.The Confederate
line was broken in several places, but before night checked the struggle
the Southerners had in some degree regained their position.The short
contest was a severe one for the Federal side.Wright lost about twelve
hundred men and Smith one thousand.The following day the final dispositions were made for the mighty struggle
that would decide Grant's last chance to interpose between Lee and
Richmond.Hancock and the Second Corps arrived at Cold Harbor and took
position on the left of General Wright.Burnside, with the Ninth Corps,
was placed near Bethesda Church on the road to Mechanicsville, while
Warren, with the Fifth, came to his left and connected with Smith's right.Sheridan was sent to hold the lower Chickahominy bridges and to cover the
road to White House, which was now the base of supplies.On the Southern
side Ewell's corps, now commanded by General Early, faced Burnside's and
Warren's.Longstreet's corps, still under Anderson, was opposite Wright
and Smith, while A. P. Hill, on the extreme right, confronted Hancock.There was sharp fighting during the entire day, but Early did not succeed
in getting upon the Federal right flank, as he attempted to do.Both armies lay very close to each other and were well entrenched.Lee was
naturally strong on his right, and his left was difficult of access, since
it must be approached through wooded swamps.Well-placed batteries made
artillery fire from front and both flanks possible, but Grant decided to
attack the whole Confederate front, and word was sent to the corps
commanders to assault at half-past four the following morning.The hot sultry weather of the preceding days had brought much suffering.The movement of troops and wagons raised clouds of dust which settled down
upon the sweltering men and beasts.But five o'clock on the afternoon of
June 2d brought the grateful rain, and this continued during the night,
giving great relief to the exhausted troops.At the hour designated the Federal lines moved promptly from their shallow
rifle-pits toward the Confederate works.The main assault was made by the
Second, Sixth, and Eighteenth corps.With determined and firm step they
started to cross the space between the opposing entrenchments.The silence
of the dawning summer morning was broken by the screams of musket-ball and
canister and shell.That move of the Federal battle-line opened the fiery
furnace across the intervening space, which was, in the next instant, a
Vesuvius, pouring tons and tons of steel and lead into the moving human
mass.From front, from right and left, artillery crashed and swept the
field, musketry and grape hewed and mangled and mowed down the line of
blue as it moved on its approach.Meade issued orders for the suspension of all further offensive
operations.A word remains to be said as to fortunes of Burnside's and Warren's
forces, which were on the Federal right.Generals Potter and Willcox of
the Ninth Corps made a quick capture of Early's advanced rifle-pits and
were waiting for the order to advance on his main entrenchments, when the
order of suspension arrived.Early fell upon him later in the day but was
repulsed.Warren, on the left of Burnside, drove Rodes' division back and
repulsed Gordon's brigade, which had attacked him.The commander of the
Fifth Corps reported that his line was too extended for further operations
and Birney's division was sent from the Second Corps to his left.But by
the time this got into position the battle of Cold Harbor was practically
over.The losses to the Federal army in this battle and the engagements which
preceded it were over seventeen thousand, while the Confederate loss did
not exceed one-fifth of that number.Grant had failed in his plan to
destroy Lee north of the James River, and saw that he must now cross it.Thirty days had passed in the campaign since the Wilderness and the grand
total in losses to Grant's army in killed, wounded, and missing was
54,929.The losses in Lee's army were never accurately given, but they
were very much less in proportion to the numerical strength of the two
armies.If Grant had inflicted punishment upon his foe equal to that
suffered by the Federal forces, Lee's army would have been practically
annihilated.The Federal general-in-chief had decided to secure Petersburg and confront
Lee once more.General Gillmore was sent by Butler, with cavalry and
infantry, on June 10th to make the capture, but was unsuccessful.Thereupon General Smith and the Eighteenth Corps were despatched to White
House Landing to go forward by water and reach Petersburg before Lee had
time to reenforce it.[Illustration: READY FOR THE ADVANCE THAT LEE DROVE BACK

facilitate the rapid crossing of the North Anna by Hancock's Corps on May
24th.Thus was completed the passage to the south of the stream of the two
wings of the Army of the Potomac.But when the center under Burnside was
driven back and severely handled at Ox Ford, Grant immediately detached a
brigade each from Hancock and Warren to attack the apex of Lee's wedge on
the south bank of the river, but the position was too strong to justify
the attempt.Then it dawned upon the Federal general-in-chief that Lee had
cleaved the Army of the Potomac into two separated bodies.To reenforce
either wing would require two crossings of the river, while Lee could
quickly march troops from one side to the other within his impregnable
wedge.As Grant put it in his report, "To make a direct attack from either
wing would cause a slaughter of our men that even success would not
justify."[Illustration: IMPROVISED BREASTWORKS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The End of the Gray Line at Cold Harbor.Here at the extreme left of the
Confederate lines at Cold Harbor is an example of the crude protection
resorted to by the soldiers on both sides in advance or retreat.A
momentary lull in the battle was invariably employed in strengthening each
position.Trees were felled under fire, and fence rails gathered quickly
were piled up to make possible another stand.The space between the lines
at Cold Harbor was so narrow at many points as to resemble a road,
encumbered with the dead and wounded.This extraordinary proximity induced
a nervous alertness which made the troops peculiarly sensitive to night
alarms; even small parties searching quietly for wounded comrades might
begin a panic.A few scattering shots were often enough to start a heavy
and continuous musketry fire and a roar of artillery along the entire
line.It was a favorite ruse of the Federal soldiers to aim their muskets
carefully to clear the top of the Confederate breastworks and then set up
a great shout.The Confederates, deceived into the belief that an attack
was coming, would spring up and expose themselves to the well-directed
volley which thinned their ranks.COLD HARBOR

[Illustration: WHERE TEN THOUSAND FELL

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The battle of Cold Harbor on June 3d was the third tremendous engagement
of Grant's campaign against Richmond within a month.It was also his
costliest onset on Lee's veteran army.Grant had risked much in his change
of base to the James in order to bring him nearer to Richmond and to the
friendly hand which Butler with the Army of the James was in a position to
reach out to him.Lee had again confronted him, entrenching himself but
six miles from the outworks of Richmond, while the Chickahominy cut off
any further flanking movement.There was nothing to do but fight it out,
and Grant ordered an attack all along the line.On June 3d he hurled the
Army of the Potomac against the inferior numbers of Lee, and in a brave
assault upon the Confederate entrenchments, lost ten thousand men in
twenty minutes.[Illustration: FEDERAL CAMP AT COLD HARBOR AFTER THE BATTLE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Grant's assault at Cold Harbor was marked by the gallantry of General
Hancock's division and of the brigades of Gibbon and Barlow, who on the
left of the Federal line charged up the ascent in their front upon the
concentrated artillery of the Confederates; they took the position and
held it for a moment under a galling fire, which finally drove them back,
but not until they had captured a flag and three hundred prisoners.The
battle was substantially over by half-past seven in the morning, but
sullen fighting continued throughout the day.About noontime General
Grant, who had visited all the corps commanders to see for himself the
positions gained and what could be done, concluded that the Confederates
were too strongly entrenched to be dislodged and ordered that further
offensive action should cease.All the next day the dead and wounded lay
on the field uncared for while both armies warily watched each other.The
lower picture was taken during this weary wait.Not till the 7th was a
satisfactory truce arranged, and then all but two of the wounded Federals
had died.No wonder that Grant wrote, "I have always regretted that the
last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made."[Illustration: THE BUSIEST PLACE IN DIXIE

April, 1865, City Point, at the juncture of the Appomattox and the James,
was a point of entry and departure for more vessels than any city of the
South including even New Orleans in times of peace.Here landed supplies
that kept an army numbering, with fighting force and supernumeraries,
nearly one hundred and twenty thousand well-supplied, well-fed,
well-contented, and well-munitioned men in the field.This was the
marvelous base--safe from attack, secure from molestation.It was meals

warm-clothed bodies against the desperation of starved and shivering
outnumbered men.There is no
need of rehearsing charges, countercharges, mines, and counter-mines.Here
lies the reason--Petersburg had to fall.As we look back with a
retrospective eye on this scene of plenty and abundance, well may the
American heart be proud that only a few miles away were men of their own
blood enduring the hardships that the defenders of Petersburg suffered in
the last campaign of starvation against numbers and plenty.[Illustration: THE FORCES AT LAST JOIN HANDS

infinite relief that Grant saw the advance of the Army of the Potomac
reach this point on June 14th.His last flanking movement was an extremely
hazardous one.More than fifty miles intervened between him and Butler by
the roads he would have to travel, and he had to cross both the
Chickahominy and the James, which were unbridged.The paramount difficulty
was to get the Army of the Potomac out of its position before Lee, who
confronted it at Cold Harbor.Lee had the shorter line and better roads to
move over and meet Grant at the Chickahominy, or he might, if he chose,
descend rapidly on Butler and crush him before Grant could unite with him."But," says Grant, "the move had to be made, and I relied upon Lee's not
seeing my danger as I saw it."Near the old Charles City Court House the
crossing of the James was successfully accomplished, and on the 14th Grant
took steamer and ran up the river to Bermuda Hundred to see General Butler
and direct the movement against Petersburg, that began the final
investment of that city.[Illustration: THE MONITOR IN A STORM._Painted by Robert Hopkin._

TO ATLANTA

    Johnston was an officer who, by the common consent of the military men
    of both sides, was reckoned second only to Lee, if second, in the
    qualities which fit an officer for the responsibility of great
    commands.... He practised a lynx-eyed watchfulness of his adversary,
    tempting him constantly to assault his entrenchments, holding his
    fortified positions to the last moment, but choosing that last moment
    so well as to save nearly every gun and wagon in the final withdrawal,
    and always presenting a front covered by such defenses that one man in
    the line was, by all sound military rules, equal to three or four in
    the attack.In this way he constantly neutralized the superiority of
    force his opponent wielded, and made his campaign from Dalton to the
    Chattahoochee a model of defensive warfare.It is Sherman's glory
    that, with a totally different temperament, he accepted his
    adversary's game, and played it with a skill that was finally
    successful, as we shall see.--_Major-General Jacob D. Cox, U. S. V.,
    in "Atlanta."_


The two leading Federal generals of the war, Grant and Sherman, met at
Nashville, Tennessee, on March 17, 1864, and arranged for a great
concerted double movement against the two main Southern armies, the Army
of Northern Virginia and the Army of Tennessee.Grant, who had been made
commander of all the Federal armies, was to take personal charge of the
Army of the Potomac and move against Lee, while to Sherman, whom, at
Grant's request, President Lincoln had placed at the head of the Military
Division of the Mississippi, he turned over the Western army, which was to
proceed against Johnston.It was decided, moreover, that the two movements were to be simultaneous
and that they were to begin early in May.Sherman concentrated his forces
around Chattanooga on the Tennessee River, where the Army of the
Cumberland had spent the winter, and where a decisive battle had been
fought some months before, in the autumn of 1863.His army was composed of
three parts, or, more properly, of three armies operating in concert.These were the Army of the Tennessee, led by General James B. McPherson;
the Army of Ohio, under General John M. Schofield, and the Army of the
Cumberland, commanded by General George H. Thomas.The last named was much
larger than the other two combined.The triple army aggregated the grand
total of ninety-nine thousand men, six thousand of whom were cavalrymen,
while four thousand four hundred and sixty belonged to the artillery.There were two hundred and fifty-four heavy guns.Soon to be pitted against Sherman's army was that of General Joseph E.
Johnston, which had spent the winter at Dalton, in the State of Georgia,
some thirty miles southeast of Chattanooga.It was by chance that Dalton
became the winter quarters of the Confederate army.In the preceding
autumn, when General Bragg had been defeated on Missionary Ridge and
driven from the vicinity of Chattanooga, he retreated to Dalton and
stopped for a night's rest.Discovering the next morning that he was not
pursued, he there remained.Some time later he was superseded by General
Johnston.By telegraph, General Sherman was apprised of the time when Grant was to
move upon Lee on the banks of the Rapidan, in Virginia, and he prepared to
move his own army at the same time.But he was two days behind Grant, who
began his Virginia campaign on May 4th.Sherman broke camp on the 6th and
led his legions across hill and valley, forest and stream, toward the
Confederate stronghold.Nature was all abloom with the opening of a
Southern spring and the soldiers, who had long chafed under their enforced
idleness, now rejoiced at the exhilarating journey before them, though
their mission was to be one of strife and bloodshed.Johnston's army numbered about fifty-three thousand, and was divided into
two corps, under the respective commands of Generals John B. Hood and
William J. Hardee.But General Polk was on his way to join them, and in a
few days Johnston had in the neighborhood of seventy thousand men.His
position at Dalton was too strong to be carried by a front attack, and
Sherman was too wise to attempt it.Leaving Thomas and Schofield to make a
feint at Johnston's front, Sherman sent McPherson on a flanking movement
by the right to occupy Snake Creek Gap, a mountain pass near Resaca, which
is about eighteen miles below Dalton.Sherman, with the main part of the army, soon occupied Tunnel Hill, which
faces Rocky Face Ridge, an eastern range of the Cumberland Mountains,
north of Dalton, on which a large part of Johnston's army was posted.The
Federal leader had little or no hope of dislodging his great antagonist
from this impregnable position, fortified by rocks and cliffs which no
army could scale while under fire.But he ordered that demonstrations be
made at several places, especially at a pass known as Rocky Face Gap.This
was done with great spirit and bravery, the men clambering over rocks and
across ravines in the face of showers of bullets and even of masses of
stone hurled down from the heights above them.On the whole they won but
little advantage.During the 8th and 9th of May, these operations were continued, the
Federals making but little impression on the Confederate stronghold.Meanwhile, on the Dalton road there was a sharp cavalry fight, the Federal
commander, General E. M. McCook, having encountered General Wheeler.McCook's advance brigade under Colonel La Grange was defeated and La
Grange was made prisoner.Sherman's chief object in these demonstrations, it will be seen, was so to
engage Johnston as to prevent his intercepting McPherson in the latter's
movement upon Resaca.In this Sherman was successful, and by the 11th he
was giving his whole energy to moving the remainder of his forces by the
right flank, as McPherson had done, to Resaca, leaving a detachment of
General O. O. Howard's Fourth Corps to occupy Dalton when evacuated.When
Johnston discovered this, he was quick to see that he must abandon his
entrenchments and intercept Sherman.Moving by the only two good roads,
Johnston beat Sherman in the race to Resaca.The town had been fortified,
owing to Johnston's foresight, and McPherson had failed to dislodge the
garrison and capture it.The Confederate army was now settled behind its
entrenchments, occupying a semicircle of low wooded hills, both flanks of
the army resting on the banks of the Oostenaula River.On the morning of May 14th, the Confederate works were invested by the
greater part of Sherman's army and it was evident that a battle was
imminent.The attack was begun about noon, chiefly by the Fourteenth Army
Corps under Palmer, of Thomas' army, and Judah's division of Schofield's.General Hindman's division of Hood's corps bore the brunt of this attack
and there was heavy loss on both sides.Later in the day, a portion of
Hood's corps was massed in a heavy column and hurled against the Federal
left, driving it back.But at this point the Twentieth Army Corps under
Hooker, of Thomas' army, dashed against the advancing Confederates and
pushed them back to their former lines.The forenoon of the next day was spent in heavy skirmishing, which grew to
the dignity of a battle.During the day's operations a hard fight for a
Confederate lunette on the top of a low hill occurred.At length, General
Butterfield, in the face of a galling fire, succeeded in capturing the
position.But so deadly was the fire from Hardee's corps that Butterfield
was unable to hold it or to remove the four guns the lunette contained.With the coming of night, General Johnston determined to withdraw his army
from Resaca.The battle had cost each army nearly three thousand men.While it was in progress, McPherson, sent by Sherman, had deftly marched
around Johnston's left with the view of cutting off his retreat south by
seizing the bridges across the Oostenaula, and at the same time the
Federal cavalry was threatening the railroad to Atlanta which ran beyond
the river.It was the knowledge of these facts that determined the
Confederate commander to abandon Resaca.Withdrawing during the night, he
led his army southward to the banks of the Etowah River.Sherman followed
but a few miles behind him.At the same time Sherman sent a division of
the Army of the Cumberland, under General Jeff.C. Davis, to Rome, at the
junction of the Etowah and the Oostenaula, where there were important
machine-shops and factories.Davis captured the town and several heavy
guns, destroyed the factories, and left a garrison to hold it.Sherman was eager for a battle in the open with Johnston and on the 17th,
near the town of Adairsville, it seemed as if the latter would gratify
him.Johnston chose a good position, posted his cavalry, deployed his
infantry, and awaited combat.The skirmishing
for some hours almost amounted to a battle.But suddenly Johnston decided
to defer a conclusive contest to another time.Again at Cassville, a few days later, Johnston drew up the Confederate
legions in battle array, evidently having decided on a general engagement
at this point.He issued a spirited address to the army: "By your courage
and skill you have repulsed every assault of the enemy.... You will now
turn and march to meet his advancing columns.... I lead you to battle."But, when his right flank had been turned by a Federal attack, and when
two of his corps commanders, Hood and Polk, advised against a general
battle, Johnston again decided on postponement.He retreated in the night
across the Etowah, destroyed the bridges, and took a strong position among
the rugged hills about Allatoona Pass, extending south to Kenesaw
Mountain.Johnston's decision to fight and then not to fight was a cause for
grumbling both on the part of his army and of the inhabitants of the
region through which he was passing.His men were eager to defend their
country, and they could not understand this Fabian policy.They would have
preferred defeat to these repeated retreats with no opportunity to show
what they could do.Johnston, however, was wiser than his critics.The Union army was larger
by far and better equipped than his own, and Sherman was a
master-strategist.His hopes rested on two or three contingencies that he
might catch a portion of Sherman's army separated from the rest; that
Sherman would be so weakened by the necessity of guarding the long line of
railroad to his base of supplies at Chattanooga, Nashville, and even
far-away Louisville, as to make it possible to defeat him in open battle,
or, finally, that Sherman might fall into the trap of making a direct
attack while Johnston was in an impregnable position, and in such a
situation he now was.Not yet, however, was Sherman inclined to fall into such a trap, and when
Johnston took his strong position at and beyond Allatoona Pass, the
Northern commander decided, after resting his army for a few days, to move
toward Atlanta by way of Dallas, southwest of the pass.Rations for a
twenty days' absence from direct railroad communication were issued to the
Federal army.In fact, Sherman's railroad connection with the North was
the one delicate problem of the whole movement.The Confederates had
destroyed the iron way as they moved southward; but the Federal engineers,
following the army, repaired the line and rebuilt the bridges almost as
fast as the army could march.Sherman's movement toward Dallas drew Johnston from the <DW72>s of the
Allatoona Hills.From Kingston, the Federal leader wrote on May 23d, "I am
already within fifty miles of Atlanta."But he was not to enter that city
for many weeks, not before he had measured swords again and again with his
great antagonist.On the 25th of May, the two great armies were facing
each other near New Hope Church, about four miles north of Dallas.Here,
for three or four days, there was almost incessant fighting, though there
was not what might be called a pitched battle.Late in the afternoon of the first day, Hooker made a vicious attack on
Stewart's division of Hood's corps.For two hours the battle raged without
a moment's cessation, Hooker being pressed back with heavy loss.During
those two hours he had held his ground against sixteen field-pieces and
five thousand infantry at close range.The name "Hell Hole" was applied to
this spot by the Union soldiers.On the next day there was considerable skirmishing in different places
along the line that divided the two armies.But the chief labor of the day
was throwing up entrenchments, preparatory to a general engagement.The
country, however, was ill fitted for such a contest.The continuous
succession of hills, covered with primeval forests, presented little
opportunity for two great armies, stretched out almost from Dallas to
Marietta, a distance of about ten miles, to come together simultaneously
at all points.A severe contest occurred on the 27th, near the center of the
battle-lines, between General O. O. Howard on the Federal side and General
Patrick Cleburne on the part of the South.Dense and almost impenetrable
was the undergrowth through which Howard led his troops to make the
attack.The fight was at close range and was fierce and bloody, the
Confederates gaining the greater advantage.The next day Johnston made a terrific attack on the Union right, under
McPherson, near Dallas.But McPherson was well entrenched and the
Confederates were repulsed with a serious loss.In the three or four days'
fighting the Federal loss was probably twenty-four hundred men and the
Confederate somewhat greater.In the early days of June, Sherman took possession of the town of
Allatoona and made it a second base of supplies, after repairing the
railroad bridge across the Etowah River.Johnston swung his left around to
Lost Mountain and his right extended beyond the railroad--a line ten miles
in length and much too long for its numbers.Johnston's army, however, had
been reenforced, and it now numbered about seventy-five thousand men.Sherman, on June 1st, had nearly one hundred and thirteen thousand men and
on the 8th he received the addition of a cavalry brigade and two divisions
of the Seventeenth Corps, under General Frank P. Blair, which had marched
from Alabama.So multifarious were the movements of the two great armies among the hills
and forests of that part of Georgia that it is impossible for us to follow
them all.On the 14th of June, Generals Johnston, Hardee, and Polk rode up
the <DW72> of Pine Mountain to reconnoiter.As they were standing, making
observations, a Federal battery in the distance opened on them and General
Polk was struck in the chest with a Parrot shell.General Polk was greatly beloved, and his death caused a shock to the
whole Confederate army.He was a graduate of West Point; but after being
graduated he took orders in the church and for twenty years before the war
was Episcopal Bishop of Louisiana.At the outbreak of the war he entered
the field and served with distinction to the moment of his death.During the next two weeks there was almost incessant fighting, heavy
skirmishing, sparring for position.It was a wonderful game of military
strategy, played among the hills and mountains and forests by two masters
in the art of war.On June 23d, Sherman wrote, "The whole country is one
vast fort, and Johnston must have full fifty miles of connected
trenches.... Our lines are now in close contact, and the fighting
incessant.... As fast as we gain one position, the enemy has another all
ready."Sherman, conscious of superior strength, was now anxious for a real
battle, a fight to the finish with his antagonist.But Johnston was too
wily to be thus caught.He made no false move on the great chessboard of
war.At length, the impatient Sherman decided to make a general front
attack, even though Johnston, at that moment, was impregnably entrenched
on the <DW72>s of Kenesaw Mountain.This was precisely what the Confederate
commander was hoping for.The desperate battle of Kenesaw Mountain occurred on the 27th of June.In
the early morning hours, the boom of Federal cannon announced the opening
of a bloody day's struggle.It was soon answered by the Confederate
batteries in the entrenchments along the mountain side, and the deafening
roar of the giant conflict reverberated from the surrounding hills.About
nine o'clock the Union infantry advance began.On the left was McPherson,
who sent the Fifteenth Army Corps, led by General John A. Logan, directly
against the mountain.The artillery from the Confederate trenches in front
of Logan cut down his men by hundreds.The Federals charged courageously
and captured the lower works, but failed to take the higher ridges.The chief assault of the day was by the Army of the Cumberland, under
Thomas.Most conspicuous in the attack were the divisions of Newton and
Davis, advancing against General Loring, successor of the lamented Polk.Far up on a ridge at one point, General Cleburne held a line of
breastworks, supported by the flanking fire of artillery.Against this a
vain and costly assault was made.When the word was given to charge, the Federals sprang forward and, in the
face of a deadly hail of musket-balls and shells, they dashed up the
<DW72>, firing as they went.Stunned and bleeding, they were checked again
and again by the withering fire from the mountain <DW72>; but they
re-formed and pressed on with dauntless valor.Some of them reached the
parapets and were instantly shot down, their bodies rolling into the
Confederate trenches among the men who had slain them, or back down the
hill whence they had come.General Harker, leading a charge against
Cleburne, was mortally wounded.His men were swept back by a galling fire,
though many fell with their brave leader.This assault on Kenesaw Mountain cost Sherman three thousand men and won
him nothing.The battle
continued but two and a half hours.It was one of the most recklessly
daring assaults during the whole war period, but did not greatly affect
the final result of the campaign.Under a flag of truce, on the day after the battle, the men of the North
and of the South met on the gory field to bury their dead and to minister
to the wounded.They met as friends for the moment, and not as foes.It
was said that there were instances of father and son, one in blue and the
other in gray, and brothers on opposite sides, meeting one another on the
bloody <DW72>s of Kenesaw.Tennessee and Kentucky had sent thousands of men
to each side in the fratricidal struggle and not infrequently families had
been divided.Three weeks of almost incessant rain fell upon the struggling armies
during this time, rendering their operations disagreeable and
unsatisfactory.The camp equipage, the men's uniforms and accouterments
were thoroughly saturated with rain and mud.Still the warriors of the
North and of the South lived and fought on the <DW72>s of the mountain
range, intent on destroying each other.Sherman was convinced by his drastic repulse at Kenesaw Mountain that
success lay not in attacking his great antagonist in a strong position,
and he resumed his old tactics.He would flank Johnston from Kenesaw as he
had flanked him out of Dalton and Allatoona Pass.He thereupon turned upon
Johnston's line of communication with Atlanta, whence the latter received
his supplies.The movement was successful, and in a few days Kenesaw
Mountain was deserted.Johnston moved to the banks of the Chattahoochee, Sherman following in
the hope of catching him while crossing the river.But the wary
Confederate had again, as at Resaca, prepared entrenchments in advance,
and these were on the north bank of the river.He hastened to them, then
turned on the approaching Federals and defiantly awaited attack.But
Sherman remembered Kenesaw and there was no battle.The feints, the sparring, the flanking movements among the hills and
forests continued day after day.The immediate aim in the early days of
July was to cross the Chattahoochee.On the 8th, Sherman sent Schofield
and McPherson across, ten miles or more above the Confederate position.Sherman's position was by no means reassuring.It is true he had, in the
space of two months, pressed his antagonist back inch by inch for more
than a hundred miles and was now almost within sight of the goal of the
campaign--the city of Atlanta.But the single line of railroad that
connected him with the North and brought supplies from Louisville, five
hundred miles away, for a hundred thousand men and twenty-three thousand
animals, might at any moment be destroyed by Confederate raiders.The necessity of guarding the Western and Atlantic Railroad was an
ever-present concern with Sherman.Forrest and his cavalry force were in
northern Mississippi waiting for him to get far enough on the way to
Atlanta for them to pounce upon the iron way and tear it to ruins.To
prevent this General Samuel D. Sturgis, with eight thousand troops, was
sent from Memphis against Forrest.He met him on the 10th of June near
Guntown, Mississippi, but was sadly beaten and driven back to Memphis, one
hundred miles away.The affair, nevertheless, delayed Forrest in his
operations against the railroad, and meanwhile General Smith's troops
returned to Memphis from the Red River expedition, somewhat late according
to the schedule but eager to join Sherman in the advance on Atlanta.Smith, however, was directed to take the offensive against Forrest, and
with fourteen thousand troops, and in a three days' fight, demoralized him
badly at Tupelo, Mississippi, July 14th-17th.Smith returned to Memphis
and made another start for Sherman, when he was suddenly turned back and
sent to Missouri, where the Confederate General Price was extremely
active, to help Rosecrans.To avoid final defeat and to win the ground he had gained had taxed
Sherman's powers to the last degree and was made possible only through his
superior numbers.Even this degree of success could not be expected to
continue if the railroad to the North should be destroyed.But Sherman
must do more than he had done; he must capture Atlanta, this Richmond of
the far South, with its cannon foundries and its great machine-shops, its
military factories, and extensive army supplies.He must divide the
Confederacy north and south as Grant's capture of Vicksburg had split it
east and west.Sherman must have Atlanta, for political reasons as well as for military
purposes.The country was in the midst of a presidential campaign.The
opposition to Lincoln's reelection was strong, and for many weeks it was
believed on all sides that his defeat was inevitable.At least, the
success of the Union arms in the field was deemed essential to Lincoln's
success at the polls.Grant had made little progress in Virginia and his
terrible repulse at Cold Harbor, in June, had cast a gloom over every
Northern State.Farragut was operating in Mobile Bay; but his success was
still in the future.The eyes of the supporters of the great war-president turned longingly,
expectantly, toward General Sherman and his hundred thousand men before
Atlanta."Do something--something spectacular--save the party and save the
country thereby from permanent disruption!"This was the cry of the
millions, and Sherman understood it.But withal, the capture of the
Georgia city may have been doubtful but for the fact that at the critical
moment the Confederate President made a decision that resulted,
unconsciously, in a decided service to the Union cause.He dismissed
General Johnston and put another in his place, one who was less strategic
and more impulsive.Jefferson Davis did not agree with General Johnston's military judgment,
and he seized on the fact that Johnston had so steadily retreated before
the Northern army as an excuse for his removal.On the 18th of July, Davis
turned the Confederate Army of Tennessee over to General John B. Hood.A
graduate of West Point of the class of 1853, a classmate of McPherson,
Schofield, and Sheridan, Hood had faithfully served the cause of the South
since the opening of the war.He was known as a fighter, and it was
believed that he would change the policy of Johnston to one of open battle
with Sherman's army.Johnston had lost, since the opening of the campaign at Dalton, about
fifteen thousand men, and the army that he now delivered to Hood consisted
of about sixty thousand in all.While Hood was no match for Sherman as a strategist, he was not a
weakling.His policy of aggression, however, was not suited to the
circumstances--to the nature of the country--in view of the fact that
Sherman's army was far stronger than his own.Two days after Hood took command of the Confederate army he offered
battle.Sherman's forces had crossed Peach Tree Creek, a small stream
flowing into the Chattahoochee, but a few miles from Atlanta, and were
approaching the city.They had thrown up slight breastworks, as was their
custom, but were not expecting an attack.Suddenly, however, about four
o'clock in the afternoon of July 20th, an imposing column of Confederates
burst from the woods near the position of the Union right center, under
Thomas.The battle was short,
fierce, and bloody.The Confederates made a gallant assault, but were
pressed back to their entrenchments, leaving the ground covered with dead
and wounded.The Federal loss in the battle of Peach Tree Creek was
placed at over seventeen hundred, the Confederate loss being much greater.This battle had been planned by Johnston before his removal, but he had
been waiting for the strategic moment to fight it.Two days later, July 22d, occurred the greatest engagement of the entire
campaign--the battle of Atlanta.The Federal army was closing in on the
entrenchments of Atlanta, and was now within two or three miles of the
city.On the night of the 21st, General Blair, of McPherson's army, had
gained possession of a high hill on the left, which commanded a view of
the heart of the city.Hood thereupon planned to recapture this hill, and
make a general attack on the morning of the 22d.He sent General Hardee on
a long night march around the extreme flank of McPherson's army, the
attack to be made at daybreak.Meantime, General Cheatham, who had
succeeded to the command of Hood's former corps, and General A. P.
Stewart, who now had Polk's corps, were to engage Thomas and Schofield in
front and thus prevent them from sending aid to McPherson.Hardee was delayed in his fifteen-mile night march, and it was noon before
he attacked.At about that hour Generals Sherman and McPherson sat talking
near the Howard house, which was the Federal headquarters, when the sudden
boom of artillery from beyond the hill that Blair had captured announced
the opening of the coming battle.McPherson quickly leaped upon his horse
and galloped away toward the sound of the guns.Meeting Logan and Blair
near the railroad, he conferred with them for a moment, when they
separated, and each hastened to his place in the battle-line.McPherson
sent aides and orderlies in various directions with despatches, until but
two were still with him.He then rode into a forest and was suddenly
confronted by a portion of the Confederate army under General Cheatham."Surrender," was the call that rang out.But he wheeled his horse as if to
flee, when he was instantly shot dead, and the horse galloped back
riderless.The death of the brilliant, dashing young leader, James B. McPherson, was
a great blow to the Union army.But thirty-six years of age, one of the
most promising men in the country, and already the commander of a military
department, McPherson was the only man in all the Western armies whom
Grant, on going to the East, placed in the same military class with
Sherman.Logan succeeded the fallen commander, and the battle raged on.The
Confederates were gaining headway.Cheatham
was pressing on, pouring volley after volley into the ranks of the Army of
the Tennessee, which seemed about to be cut in twain.General Sherman was present and saw
the danger.Calling for Schofield to send several batteries, he placed
them and poured a concentrated artillery fire through the gap and mowed
down the advancing men in swaths.At the same time, Logan pressed forward
and Schofield's infantry was called up.The Confederates were hurled back
with great loss.The shadows of night fell--and the battle of Atlanta was
over.Hood's losses exceeded eight thousand of his brave men, whom he
could ill spare.The Confederate army recuperated within the defenses of Atlanta--behind an
almost impregnable barricade.Sherman had no hope of carrying the city by
assault, while to surround and invest it was impossible with his numbers.He determined, therefore, to strike Hood's lines of supplies.On July
28th, Hood again sent Hardee out from his entrenchments to attack the Army
of the Tennessee, now under the command of General Howard.A fierce battle
at Ezra Church on the west side of the city ensued, and again the
Confederates were defeated with heavy loss.A month passed and Sherman had made little progress toward capturing
Atlanta.Two cavalry raids which he organized resulted in defeat, but the
two railroads from the south into Atlanta were considerably damaged.But,
late in August, the Northern commander made a daring move that proved
successful.Leaving his base of supplies, as Grant had done before
Vicksburg, and marching toward Jonesboro, Sherman destroyed the Macon and
Western Railroad, the only remaining line of supplies to the Confederate
army.Hood attempted to block the march on Jonesboro, and Hardee was sent with
his and S. D. Lee's Corps to attack the Federals, while he himself sought
an opportunity to move upon Sherman's right flank.Hardee's attack failed,
and this necessitated the evacuation of Atlanta.After blowing up his
magazines and destroying the supplies which his men could not carry with
them, Hood abandoned the city, and the next day, September 2d, General
Slocum, having succeeded Hooker, led the Twentieth Corps of the Federal
army within its earthen walls.Hood had made his escape, saving his army
from capture.His chief desire would have been to march directly north on
Marietta and destroy the depots of Federal supplies, but a matter of more
importance prevented.Thirty-four thousand Union prisoners were confined
at Andersonville, and a small body of cavalry could have released them.So
Hood placed himself between Andersonville and Sherman.In the early days of September the Federal hosts occupied the city toward
which they had toiled all the summer long.At East Point, Atlanta, and
Decatur, the three armies settled for a brief rest, while the cavalry,
stretched for many miles along the Chattahoochee, protected their flanks
and rear.Since May their ranks had been depleted by some twenty-eight
thousand killed and wounded, while nearly four thousand had fallen
prisoners, into the Confederates' hands.It was a great price, but whatever else the capture of Atlanta did, it
ensured the reelection of Abraham Lincoln to the presidency of the United
States.The total Confederate losses were in the neighborhood of
thirty-five thousand, of which thirteen thousand were prisoners.[Illustration: SHERMAN IN 1865

fighting was over.To Joseph E. Johnston he offered most liberal terms of
surrender for the Southern armies.Their acceptance would have gone far to
prevent the worst of the reconstruction enormities.Unfortunately his
first convention with Johnston was disapproved.The death of Lincoln had
removed the guiding hand that would have meant so much to the nation.To
those who have read his published correspondence and his memoirs Sherman
appears in a very human light.He was fluent and frequently reckless in
speech and writing, but his kindly humanity is seen in both.[Illustration: BUZZARD'S ROOST, GEORGIA, MAY 7, 1864]

In the upper picture rises the precipitous height of Rocky Face as Sherman
saw it on May 7, 1864.His troops under Thomas had moved forward along the
line of the railroad, opening the great Atlanta campaign on schedule time.Looking down into the gorge called Buzzard's Roost, through which the
railroad passes, Sherman could see swarms of Confederate troops, the road
filled with obstructions, and hostile batteries crowning the cliffs on
either side.He knew that his antagonist, Joe Johnston, here confronted
him in force.But it was to be a campaign of brilliant flanking movements,
and Sherman sat quietly down to wait till the trusty McPherson should
execute the first one.In the lower picture, drawn up on dress parade, stands one of the finest
fighting organizations in the Atlanta campaign.This regiment won its
spurs in the first Union victory in the West at Mill Springs, Kentucky,
January 19, 1862.There, according to the muster-out roll, "William Blake,
musician, threw away his drum and took a gun."The spirit of this drummer
boy of Company F was the spirit of all the troops from Minnesota.A
Georgian noticed an unusually fine body of men marching by, and when told
that they were a Minnesota regiment, said, "I didn't know they had any
troops up there."But the world was to learn the superlative fighting
qualities of the men from the Northwest.Sherman was glad to have all he
could get of them in this great army of one hundred thousand veterans.[Illustration: THE SECOND MINNESOTA INFANTRY--ENGAGED AT ROCKY FACE RIDGE,

General Richard W. Johnson, ready to advance with his cavalry division in
the vanguard of the direct movement upon the Confederates strongly posted
at Dalton.Sherman's cavalry forces under Stoneman and Garrard were not
yet fully equipped and joined the army after the campaign had opened.General Richard W. Johnson's division of Thomas' command, with General
Palmer's division, was given the honor of heading the line of march when
the Federals got in motion on May 5th.The same troops (Palmer's division)
had made the same march in February, sent by Grant to engage Johnston at
Dalton during Sherman's Meridian campaign.Johnson was a West Pointer; he
had gained his cavalry training in the Mexican War, and had fought the
Indians on the Texas border.He distinguished himself at Corinth, and
rapidly rose to the command of a division in Buell's army.Fresh from a
Confederate prison, he joined the Army of the Cumberland in the summer of
1862 to win new laurels at Stone's River, Chickamauga, and Missionary
Ridge.His sabers were conspicuously active in the Atlanta campaign; and
at the battle of New Hope Church on May 28th Johnson himself was wounded,
but recovered in time to join Schofield after the fall of Atlanta and to
assist him in driving Hood and Forrest out of Tennessee.For his bravery
at the battle of Nashville he was brevetted brigadier-general, U. S. A.,
December 16, 1864, and after the war he was retired with the brevet of
major-general.[Illustration: RESACA--FIELD OF THE FIRST HEAVY FIGHTING

had caused to be thrown up by the <DW64> laborers all along his line of
possible retreat.McPherson, sent by Sherman to strike the railroad in
Johnston's rear, got his head of column through Snake Creek Gap on May
9th, and drove off a Confederate cavalry brigade which retreated toward
Dalton, bringing to Johnston the first news that a heavy force of Federals
was already in his rear.McPherson, within a mile and a half of Resaca,
could have walked into the town with his twenty-three thousand men, but
concluded that the Confederate entrenchments were too strongly held to
assault.When Sherman arrived he found that Johnston, having the shorter
route, was there ahead of him with his entire army strongly posted.On May
15th, "without attempting to assault the fortified works," says Sherman,
"we pressed at all points, and the sound of cannon and musketry rose all
day to the dignity of a battle."Its havoc is seen in the shattered trees
and torn ground in the lower picture.[Illustration: THE WORK OF THE FIRING AT RESACA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The strong works in the pictures, commanding the railroad bridge over the
Etowah River, were the fourth fortified position to be abandoned by
Johnston within a month.Pursued by Thomas from Resaca, he had made a
brief stand at Kingston and then fallen back steadily and in superb order
into Cassville.There he issued an address to his army announcing his
purpose to retreat no more but to accept battle.His troops were all drawn
up in preparation for a struggle, but that night at supper with Generals
Hood and Polk he was convinced by them that the ground occupied by their
troops was untenable, being enfiladed by the Federal artillery.Johnston,
therefore, gave up his purpose of battle, and on the night of May 20th put
the Etowah River between himself and Sherman and retreated to Allatoona
Pass, shown in the lower picture.[Illustration: ALLATOONA PASS IN THE DISTANCE]

In taking this the camera was planted inside the breastworks seen on the
eminence in the upper picture.Sherman's army now rested after its rapid
advance and waited a few days for the railroad to be repaired in their
rear so that supplies could be brought up.Meanwhile Johnston was being
severely criticized at the South for his continual falling back without
risking a battle.His friends stoutly maintained that it was all
strategic, while some of the Southern newspapers quoted the Federal
General Scott's remark, "Beware of Lee advancing, and watch Johnston at a
stand; for the devil himself would be defeated in the attempt to whip him
retreating."But General Jeff C. Davis, sent by Sherman, took Rome on May
17th and destroyed valuable mills and foundries.Thus began the
accomplishment of one of the main objects of Sherman's march.[Illustration: PINE MOUNTAIN, WHERE POLK, THE FIGHTING BISHOP OF THE
CONFEDERACY, WAS KILLED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The blasted pine rears its gaunt height above the mountain <DW72>, covered
with trees slashed down to hold the Federals at bay; and here, on June 14,
1864, the Confederacy lost a commander, a bishop, and a hero.Lieut.-General Leonidas Polk, commanding one of Johnston's army corps,
with Johnston himself and Hardee, another corps commander, was studying
Sherman's position at a tense moment of the latter's advance around Pine
Mountain.The three Confederates stood upon the rolling height, where the
center of Johnston's army awaited the Federal attack.They could see the
columns in blue pushing east of them; the smoke and rattle of musketry as
the pickets were driven in; and the bustle with which the Federal advance
guard felled trees and constructed trenches at their very feet.On the
lonely height the three figures stood conspicuous.A Federal order was
given the artillery to open upon any men in gray who looked like officers
reconnoitering the new position.So, while Hardee was pointing to his
comrade and his chief the danger of one of his divisions which the Federal
advance was cutting off, the bishop-general was struck in the chest by a
cannon shot.Thus the Confederacy lost a leader of unusual influence.Although a bishop of the Episcopal Church, Polk was educated at West
Point.When he threw in his lot with the Confederacy, thousands of his
fellow-Louisianians followed him.A few days before the battle of Pine
Mountain, as he and General Hood were riding together, the bishop was told
by his companion that he had never been received into the communion of a
church and was begged that the rite might be performed.At Hood's headquarters, by the light of a tallow
candle, with a tin basin on the mess table for a baptismal font, and with
Hood's staff present as witnesses, all was ready.Hood, "with a face like
that of an old crusader," stood before the bishop.Crippled by wounds at
Gaines' Mill, Gettysburg, and Chickamauga, he could not kneel, but bent
forward on his crutches.The bishop, in full uniform of the Confederate
army, administered the rite.A few days later, by a strange coincidence,
he was approached by General Johnston on the same errand, and the man whom
Hood was soon to succeed was baptized in the same simple manner.Polk, as
Bishop, had administered his last baptism, and as soldier had fought his
last battle; for Pine Mountain was near.[Illustration: LIEUT.-GEN.LEONIDAS POLK, C. S.[Illustration: IN THE HARDEST FIGHT OF THE CAMPAIGN--THE

troops in the wooded country.Nevertheless he must either assault
Johnston's strong position on the mountain or begin again his flanking
tactics.He decided upon the former, and on June 27th, after three days'
preparation, the assault was made.At nine in the morning along the
Federal lines the furious fire of musketry and artillery was begun, but at
all points the Confederates met it with determined courage and in great
force.McPherson's attacking column, under General Blair, fought its way
up the face of little Kenesaw but could not reach the summit.Then the
courageous troops of Thomas charged up the face of the mountain and
planted their colors on the very parapet of the Confederate works.Here
General Harker, commanding the brigade in which fought the 125th Ohio,
fell mortally wounded, as did Brigadier-General Daniel McCook, and also
General Wagner.[Illustration: FEDERAL ENTRENCHMENTS AT THE FOOT OF KENESAW MOUNTAIN

June and July.The
battery did not go into this campaign without previous experience.It had
already fought as one of the eight batteries at Fort Henry and Fort
Donelson, heard the roar of the battle of Shiloh, and participated in the
sieges of Corinth and Vicksburg.The artillery in the West was not a whit
less necessary to the armies than that in the East.Pope's brilliant feat
of arms in the capture of Island No.10 added to the growing respect in
which the artillery was held by the other arms of the service.The
effective fire of the massed batteries at Murfreesboro turned the tide of
battle.At Chickamauga the Union artillery inflicted fearful losses upon
the Confederates.At Atlanta again they counted their dead by the
hundreds, and at Franklin and Nashville the guns maintained the best
traditions of the Western armies.They played no small part in winning
battles.[Illustration: THOMAS' HEADQUARTERS NEAR MARIETTA DURING THE FIGHTING OF

until he is actually farther from Atlanta than Sherman's right flank.Who
will reach the Chattahoochee first?There, if anywhere, Johnston must make
his stand; he must hold the fords and ferries, and the fortifications
that, with the wisdom of a far-seeing commander, he has for a long time
been preparing.The rustic work in the photograph, which embowers the
tents of the commanding general and his staff, is the sort of thing that
Civil War soldiers had learned to throw up within an hour after pitching
camp.[Illustration: PALISADES AND _CHEVAUX-DE-FRISE_ GUARDING ATLANTA

keypoints in the Confederate defense, the fort at the head of Marietta
Street, toward which the Federal lines were advancing from the northwest.The old Potter house in the background, once a quiet, handsome country
seat, is now surrounded by bristling fortifications, palisades, and double
lines of _chevaux-de-frise_.Atlanta was engaged in the final grapple with
the force that was to overcome her.Sherman has fought his way past
Kenesaw and across the Chattahoochee, through a country which he describes
as "one vast fort," saying that "Johnston must have at least fifty miles
of connected trenches with abatis and finished batteries."Anticipating
that Sherman might drive him back upon Atlanta, Johnston had constructed,
during the winter, heavily fortified positions all the way from Dalton.During his two months in retreat the fortifications at Atlanta had been
strengthened to the utmost.What he might have done behind them was never
to be known.[Illustration: THE CHATTAHOOCHEE BRIDGE]

"One of the strongest pieces of field fortification I ever saw"--this was
Sherman's characterization of the entrenchments that guarded the railroad
bridge over the Chattahoochee on July 5th.A glimpse of the bridge and the
freshly-turned earth in 1864 is given by the upper picture.At this river
Johnston made his final effort to hold back Sherman from a direct attack
upon Atlanta.If Sherman could get successfully across that river, the
Confederates would be compelled to fall back behind the defenses of the
city, which was the objective of the campaign.Sherman perceived at once
the futility of trying to carry by assault this strongly garrisoned
position.Instead, he made a feint at crossing the river lower down, and
simultaneously went to work in earnest eight miles north of the bridge.The lower picture shows the canvas pontoon boats as perfected by Union
engineers in 1864.A number of these were stealthily set up and launched
by Sherman's Twenty-third Corps near the mouth of Soap Creek, behind a
ridge.Byrd's brigade took the defenders of the southern bank completely
by surprise.It was short work for the Federals to throw pontoon bridges
across and to occupy the coveted spot in force.[Illustration: INFANTRY AND ARTILLERY CROSSING ON BOATS MADE OF PONTOONS

warfare," declares one of Sherman's own division commanders, Jacob D. Cox.There was not a man in the Federal army from Sherman down that did not
rejoice to hear that Johnston had been superseded by Hood on July 18th.Johnston, whose mother was a niece of Patrick Henry, was fifty-seven years
old, cold in manner, measured and accurate in speech.His dark firm face,
surmounted by a splendidly intellectual forehead, betokened the
experienced and cautious soldier.His dismissal was one of the political
mistakes which too often hampered capable leaders on both sides.His
Fabian policy in Georgia was precisely the same as that which was winning
fame against heavy odds for Lee in Virginia.[Illustration: GENERAL JOSEPH EGGLESTON JOHNSTON, C. S. A.

The countenance of Hood, on the other hand, indicates an eager, restless
energy, an impetuosity that lacked the poise of Sherman, whose every
gesture showed the alertness of mind and soundness of judgment that in him
were so exactly balanced.Both Schofield and McPherson were classmates of
Hood at West Point, and characterized him to Sherman as "bold even to
rashness and courageous in the extreme."He struck the first offensive
blow at Sherman advancing on Atlanta, and wisely adhered to the plan of
the battle as it had been worked out by Johnston just before his removal.But the policy of attacking was certain to be finally disastrous to the
Confederates.[Illustration: PEACH-TREE CREEK, WHERE HOOD HIT HARD

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Counting these closely clustered Federal graves gives one an idea of the
overwhelming onset with Hood become the aggressor on July 20th.Beyond the
graves are some of the trenches from which the Federals were at first
irresistibly driven.In the background flows Peach-Tree Creek, the little
stream that gives its name to the battlefield.Hood, impatient to
signalize his new responsibility by a stroke that would at once dispel the
gloom at Richmond, had posted his troops behind strongly fortified works
on a ridge commanding the valley of Peach-Tree Creek about five miles to
the north of Atlanta.As the
Federals were disposing their lines and entrenching before this position,
Hood's eager eyes detected a gap in their formation and at four o'clock in
the afternoon hurled a heavy force against it.Thus he proved his
reputation for courage, but the outcome showed the mistake.For a brief
interval Sherman's forces were in great peril.But the Federals under
Newton and Geary rallied and held their ground, till Ward's division in a
brave counter-charge drove the Confederates back.He abandoned his entrenchments that night, leaving on the field
five hundred dead, one thousand wounded, and many prisoners.Sherman
estimated the total Confederate loss at no less than five thousand.That
of the Federals was fifteen hundred.[Illustration: THE ARMY'S FINGER-TIPS--PICKETS BEFORE ATLANTA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.A Federal picket post on the lines before Atlanta.This picture was taken
shortly before the battle of July 22d.The soldiers are idling about
unconcerned at exposing themselves; this is on the "reserve post."Somewhat in advance of this lay the outer line of pickets, and it would be
time enough to seek cover if they were driven in.Thus armies feel for
each other, stretching out first their sensitive fingers--the pickets.If
these recoil, the skirmishers are sent forward while the strong arm, the
line of battle, gathers itself to meet the foe.As this was an inner line,
it was more strongly fortified than was customary with the pickets.But
the men of both sides had become very expert in improvising field-works at
this stage of the war.Hard campaigning had taught the veterans the
importance to themselves of providing such protection, and no orders had
to be given for their construction.As soon as a regiment gained a
position desirable to hold, the soldiers would throw up a strong parapet
of dirt and logs in a single night.In order to spare the men as much as
possible, Sherman ordered his division commanders to organize pioneer
detachments out of the <DW64>s that escaped to the Federals.[Illustration: THE FINAL BLOW TO THE CONFEDERACY'S SOUTHERN STRONGHOLD

of Atlanta.In the picture the rails heating red-hot amid the flaming
bonfires of the ties, and the piles of twisted debris show vividly what
Sherman meant when he said their "work was done with a will."Sherman saw
that in order to take Atlanta without terrific loss he must cut off all
its rail communications.This he did by "taking the field with our main
force and using it against the communications of Atlanta instead of
against its intrenchments."On the night of August 25th he moved with
practically his entire army and wagon-trains loaded with fifteen days'
rations.By the morning of the 27th the whole front of the city was
deserted.The Confederates concluded that Sherman was in retreat.Next day
they found out their mistake, for the Federal army lay across the West
Point Railroad while the soldiers began wrecking it.Next day they were in
motion toward the railroad to Macon, and General Hood began to understand
that a colossal raid was in progress.After the occupation, when this
picture was taken, Sherman's men completed the work of destruction.[Illustration: THE RUIN OF HOOD'S RETREAT--DEMOLISHED CARS AND

Jonesboro and cut them off from returning to Atlanta.This was Hood's last
effort to save his communications.About midnight sounds of exploding
shells and what seemed like volleys of musketry arose in the direction of
Atlanta.Supplies and ammunition
that Hood could carry with him were being removed; large quantities of
provisions were being distributed among the citizens, and as the troops
marched out they were allowed to take what they could from the public
stores.The noise that Sherman heard that
night was the blowing up of the rolling-mill and of about a hundred cars
and six engines loaded with Hood's abandoned ammunition.The picture shows
the Georgia Central Railroad east of the town.REPRESENTATIVE SOLDIERS FROM A DOZEN STATES

BLAIR, OF MISSOURI

Although remaining politically neutral throughout the war, Missouri
contributed four hundred and forty-seven separate military organizations
to the Federal armies, and over one hundred to the Confederacy.The Union
sentiment in the State is said to have been due to Frank P. Blair, who,
early in 1861, began organizing home guards.Blair subsequently joined
Grant's command and served with that leader until Sherman took the helm in
the West.With Sherman Major-General Blair fought in Georgia and through
the Carolinas.[Illustration]

BAKER, OF CALIFORNIA

California contributed twelve military organizations to the Federal
forces, but none of them took part in the campaigns east of the
Mississippi.Its Senator, Edward D. Baker, was in his place in Washington
when the war broke out, and, being a close friend of Lincoln, promptly
organized a regiment of Pennsylvanians which was best known by its synonym
"First California."Colonel Baker was killed at the head of it at the
battle of Ball's Bluff, Virginia, October 21, 1861.Baker had been
appointed brigadier-general but declined.[Illustration]

KELLEY, OF WEST VIRGINIA

West Virginia counties had already supplied soldiers for the Confederates
when the new State was organized in 1861.As early as May, 1861, Colonel
B. F. Kelley was in the field with the First West Virginia Infantry
marshalled under the Stars and Stripes.He served to the end of the war
and was brevetted major-general.West Virginia furnished thirty-seven
organizations of all arms to the Federal armies, chiefly for local defense
and for service in contiguous territory.General Kelley was prominent in
the Shenandoah campaigns.[Illustration]

SMYTH, OF DELAWARE

Little Delaware furnished to the Federal armies fifteen separate military
organizations.First in the field was Colonel Thomas A. Smyth, with the
First Delaware Infantry.Early promoted to the command of a brigade, he
led it at Gettysburg, where it received the full force of Pickett's charge
on Cemetery Ridge, July 3, 1863.He was brevetted major-general and fell
at Farmville, on Appomattox River, Va., April 7, 1865, two days before the
surrender at Appomattox.General Smyth was a noted leader in the Second
Corps.[Illustration]

MITCHELL, OF KANSAS

The virgin State of Kansas sent fifty regiments, battalions, and batteries
into the Federal camps.Its Second Infantry was organized and led to the
field by Colonel R. B. Mitchell, a veteran of the Mexican War.At the
first battle in the West, Wilson's Creek, Mo.(August 10, 1861), he was
wounded.At the battle of Perryville, Brigadier-General Mitchell commanded
a division in McCook's Corps and fought desperately to hold the Federal
left flank against a sudden and desperate assault by General Bragg's
Confederates.[Illustration]

CROSS, OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

New Hampshire supplied twenty-nine military organizations to the Federal
armies.To the Granite State belongs the grim distinction of furnishing
the regiment which had the heaviest mortality roll of any infantry
organization in the army.This was the Fifth New Hampshire, commanded by
Colonel E. E. Cross.The Fifth served in the Army of the Potomac.At
Gettysburg, Colonel Cross commanded a brigade, which included the Fifth
New Hampshire, and was killed at the head of it near Devil's Den, on July
2, 1863.LEADERS IN SECURING VOLUNTEERS FOR NORTH AND SOUTH

PEARCE, OF ARKANSAS

Arkansas entered into the war with enthusiasm, and had a large contingent
of Confederate troops ready for the field in the summer of 1861.At
Wilson's Creek, Missouri, August 10, 1861, there were four regiments and
two batteries of Arkansans under command of Brigadier-General N. B.
Pearce.Arkansas furnished seventy separate military organizations to the
Confederate armies and seventeen to the Federals.The State was gallantly
represented in the Army of Northern Virginia, notably at Antietam and
Gettysburg.[Illustration]

STEUART, OF MARYLAND

Maryland quickly responded to the Southern call to arms, and among its
first contribution of soldiers was George H. Steuart, who led a battalion
across the Potomac early in 1861.These Marylanders fought at First Bull
Run, or Manassas, and Lee's army at Petersburg included Maryland troops
under Brigadier-General Steuart.During the war this little border State,
politically neutral, sent six separate organizations to the Confederates
in Virginia, and mustered thirty-five for the Federal camps and for local
defense.[Illustration]

CRITTENDEN, THE CONFEDERATE

Kentucky is notable as a State which sent brothers to both the Federal and
Confederate armies.Major-General George B. Crittenden, C. S. A., was the
brother of Major-General Thomas L. Crittenden, U. S. A. Although remaining
politically neutral throughout the war, the Blue Grass State sent
forty-nine regiments, battalions, and batteries across the border to
uphold the Stars and Bars, and mustered eighty of all arms to battle
around the Stars and Stripes and protect the State from Confederate
incursions.[Illustration]

RANSOM, OF NORTH CAROLINA

The last of the Southern States to cast its fortunes in with the
Confederacy, North Carolina vied with the pioneers in the spirit with
which it entered the war.With the First North Carolina, Lieut.-Col.Matt
W. Ransom was on the firing-line early in 1861.Under his leadership as
brigadier-general, North Carolinians carried the Stars and Bars on all the
great battlefields of the Army of Northern Virginia.The State furnished
ninety organizations for the Confederate armies, and sent eight to the
Federal camps.[Illustration]

FINEGAN, OF FLORIDA

Florida was one of the first to follow South Carolina's example in
dissolving the Federal compact.It furnished twenty-one military
organizations to the Confederate forces, and throughout the war maintained
a vigorous home defense.Its foremost soldier to take the field when the
State was menaced by a strong Federal expedition in February, 1864, was
Brigadier-General Joseph Finegan.Hastily gathering scattered detachments,
he defeated and checked the expedition at the battle of Olustee, or Ocean
Pond, on February 20.[Illustration]

CLEBURNE, OF TENNESSEE

Cleburne was of foreign birth, but before the war was one year old he
became the leader of Tennesseeans, fighting heroically on Tennessee soil.At Shiloh, Cleburne's brigade, and at Murfreesboro, Chattanooga, and
Franklin, Major-General P. R. Cleburne's division found the post of honor.At Franklin this gallant Irishman "The 'Stonewall' Jackson of the West,"
led Tennesseeans for the last time and fell close to the breastworks.Tennessee sent the Confederate armies 129 organizations, and the Federal
fifty-six.[Illustration: THE LAST OF THE FRIGATE._Painted by E. Packbauer._

THE LAST CONFLICTS IN THE SHENANDOAH

    Sheridan's operations were characterized not so much, as has been
    supposed, by any originality of method, as by a just appreciation of
    the proper manner of combining the two arms of infantry and cavalry.He constantly used his powerful body of horse, which under his
    disciplined hand attained a high degree of perfection, as an
    impenetrable mask behind which he screened the execution of maneuvers
    of infantry columns hurled with a mighty momentum on one of the
    enemy's flanks.--_William Swinton, in "Campaigns of the Army of the
    Potomac."_


On July 12, 1864, in the streets of Washington, there could be distinctly
heard the boom of cannon and the sharp firing of musketry.The old specter "threaten Washington," that for
three years had been a standing menace to the Federal authorities and a
"very present help" to the Confederates, now seemed to have come in the
flesh.The hopes of the South and the fears of the North were apparently
about to be realized.The occasion of this demonstration before the very gates of the city was
the result of General Lee's project to relieve the pressure on his own
army, by an invasion of the border States and a threatening attitude
toward the Union capital.The plan had worked well before, and Lee
believed it again would be effective.Grant was pushing him hard in front
of Petersburg.Accordingly, Lee despatched the daring soldier, General
Jubal A. Early, to carry the war again to the northward.He was to go by
the beautiful and fertile Shenandoah valley, that highway of the
Confederates along which the legions of the South had marched and
countermarched.On the 9th of July, the advance lines of the Confederate
force came to the banks of the Monocacy, where they found General Lew
Wallace posted, with eight thousand men, half of Early's numbers, on the
eastern side of that stream, to contest the approach of the Southern
troops.The battle was brief but bloody; the Confederates, crossing the stream and
climbing its slippery banks, hurled their lines of gray against the
compact ranks of blue.The attack was impetuous; the repulse was stubborn.A wail of musketry rent the air and the Northern soldiers fell back to
their second position.Between the opposing forces was a narrow ravine
through which flowed a small brook.Across this stream the tide of battle
rose and fell.Its limpid current was soon crimsoned by the blood of the
dead and wounded.Wallace's columns, as did those of Early, bled, but they
stood.The result of the battle for a time hung in the balance.The retreat began, some of the troops in
order but the greater portion in confusion, and the victorious
Confederates found again an open way to Washington.Now within half a dozen miles of the city, with the dome of the Capitol in
full view, the Southern general pushed his lines so close to Fort Stevens
that he was ready to train his forty pieces of artillery upon its walls.General Augur, in command of the capital's defenses, hastily collected
what strength in men and guns he could.Heavy artillery, militia, sailors
from the navy yard, convalescents, Government employees of all kinds were
rushed to the forts around the city.General Wright, with two divisions of
the Sixth Corps, arrived from the camp at Petersburg, and Emory's division
of the Nineteenth Corps came just in time from New Orleans.This was on
July 11th, the very day on which Early appeared in front of Fort Stevens.The Confederate had determined to make an assault, but the knowledge of
the arrival of Wright and Emory caused him to change his mind.He realized
that, if unsuccessful, his whole force would be lost, and he concluded to
return.Nevertheless, he spent the 12th of July in threatening the city.In the middle of the afternoon General Wright sent out General Wheaton
with Bidwell's brigade of Getty's division, and Early's pickets and
skirmishers were driven back a mile.Pond in "The
Shenandoah Valley" thus describes the scene: "On the parapet of Fort
Stevens stood the tall form of Abraham Lincoln by the side of General
Wright, who in vain warned the eager President that his position was swept
by the bullets of sharpshooters, until an officer was shot down within
three feet of him, when he reluctantly stepped below.Sheltered from the
line of fire, Cabinet officers and a group of citizens and ladies,
breathless with excitement, watched the fortunes of the flight."Under cover of night the Confederates began to retrace their steps and
made their way to the Shenandoah, with General Wright in pursuit.As the
Confederate army was crossing that stream, at Snicker's Ferry, on the
18th, the pursuing Federals came upon them.Early turned, repulsed them,
and continued on his way to Winchester, where General Averell, from
Hunter's forces, now at Harper's Ferry, attacked them with his cavalry and
took several hundred prisoners.The Federal authorities were looking for a "man of the hour"--one whom
they might pit against the able and strategic Early.Such a one was found
in General Philip Henry Sheridan, whom some have called the "Marshal Ney
of America."He was selected by General Grant, and his instructions were
to drive the Confederates out of the Valley once for all.The middle of September found the Confederate forces centered about
Winchester, and the Union army was ten miles distant, with the Opequon
between them.At two o'clock on the morning of September 19th, the Union
camp was in motion, preparing for marching orders.At three o'clock the
forward movement was begun, and by daylight the Federal advance had driven
in the Confederate pickets.Emptying into the Opequon from the west are
two converging streams, forming a triangle with the Winchester and
Martinsburg pike as a base.The town of Winchester is situated on this road, and was therefore at the
bottom of the triangle.Before the town, the Confederate army stretched
its lines between the two streams.The Union army would have to advance
from the apex of the triangle, through a narrow ravine, shut in by thickly
wooded hills and gradually emerging into an undulating valley.At the end
of the gorge was a Confederate outwork, guarding the approach to
Winchester.Both generals had the same plan of battle in mind.Sheridan
would strike the Confederate center and right.Early was willing he should
do this, for he planned to strike the Union right, double it back, get
between Sheridan's army and the gorge, and thus cut off its retreat.It took time for the Union troops to pass through the ravine, and it was
late in the forenoon before the line of battle was formed.The attack and
defense were alike obstinate.Upon the Sixth Corps and Grover's division
of the Nineteenth Corps fell the brunt of the battle, since they were to
hold the center while the Army of West Virginia, under General Crook,
would sweep around them and turn the position of the opposing forces.The
Confederate General Ramseur, with his troops, drove back the Federal
center, held his ground for two hours, while the opposing lines were swept
by musketry and artillery from the front, and enfiladed by artillery.By this time, Russell's division of the Sixth Corps emerged from the
ravine.Forming in two lines, it marched quickly to the front.About the
same time the Confederates were also being reenforced.General Rodes
plunged into the fight, making a gallant attack and losing his life.General Gordon, with his columns of gray, swept across the summit of the
hills and through the murky clouds of smoke saw the steady advance of the
lines of blue.One of Russell's brigades struck the Confederate flank, and
the Federal line was reestablished.As the division moved forward to do
this General Russell fell, pierced through the heart by a piece of shell.The Fifth Maine battery, galloping into the field, unlimbered and with an
enfilading storm of canister aided in turning the tide.Piece by piece the
shattered Union line was picked up and reunited.Early sent the last of
his reserves into the conflict to turn the Union right.Now ensued the
fiercest fighting of the day.Regiment after regiment advanced to the wood
only to be hurled back again.Here it was that the One hundred and
fourteenth New York left its dreadful toll of men.Its position after the
battle could be told by the long, straight line of one hundred and
eighty-five of its dead and wounded.It was three o'clock in the afternoon; the hour of Early's repulse had
struck.To the right of the Union lines could be heard a mighty yell.The
Confederates seemed to redouble their fire.The shivering lightning bolts
shot through the air and the volleys of musketry increased in intensity.Then, across the shell-plowed field, came the reserves under General
Crook.Breasting the Confederate torrent of lead, which cut down nine
hundred of the reserves while crossing the open space, they rushed toward
the embattled lines of the South.At the same moment, coming out of the woods in the rear of the Federals,
were seen the men of the Nineteenth Corps under General Emory, who had for
three hours been lying in the grass awaiting their opportunity.The
Confederate bullets had been falling thick in their midst with fatal
certainty.Rushing into the contest like
madmen, they stopped at nothing.From two sides of the wood the men of
Emory and Crook charged simultaneously.The Union line overlapped the
Confederate at every point and doubled around the unprotected flanks.The
day for the Southerners was irretrievably lost.They fell back toward
Winchester in confusion.As they did so, a great uproar was heard on the
pike road.It was the Federal cavalry under General Torbert sweeping up
the road, driving the Confederate troopers before them.The surprised mass
was pressed into its own lines.The infantry was charged and many
prisoners and battle-flags captured.The sun was now sinking upon the horizon, and on the ascending <DW72>s in
the direction of the town could be seen the long, dark lines of men
following at the heels of the routed army.Along the crest of the
embattled summit galloped a force of cavalrymen, which, falling upon the
disorganized regiments of Early, aided, in the language of Sheridan, "to
send them whirling through Winchester."The Union pursuit continued until
the twilight had come and the shadows of night screened the scattered
forces of Early from the pursuing cavalrymen.The battle of Winchester, or
the Opequon, had been a bloody one--a loss of five thousand on the Federal
side, and about four thousand on the Confederate.By daylight of the following morning the victorious army was again in
pursuit.On the afternoon of that day, it caught up with the Confederates,
who now turned at bay at Fisher's Hill to resist the further approach of
their pursuers.The position selected by General Early was a strong one,
and his antagonist at once recognized it as such.The valley of the
Shenandoah at this point is about four miles wide, lying between Fisher's
Hill and Little North Mountain.General Early's line extended across the
entire valley, and he had greatly increased his already naturally strong
position.From the summit of Three Top
Mountain, his signal corps informed him of every movement of the Union
army in the valley below.General Sheridan's actions indicated a purpose
to assault the center of the Confederate line.For two days he continued
massing his regiments in that direction, at times even skirmishing for
position.General Wright pushed his men to within seven hundred yards of
the Southern battle-line.While this was going on in full view of the
Confederate general and his army, another movement was being executed
which even the vigilant signal officers on Three Top Mountain had not
observed.On the night of September 20th, the troops of General Crook were moved
into the timber on the north bank of Cedar Creek.All during the next day,
they lay concealed.That night they crossed the stream and the next
morning were again hidden by the woods and ravines.At five o'clock on the
morning of the 22d, Crook's men were nearly opposite the Confederate
center.Marching his men in perfect silence, by one o'clock he had arrived
at the left and front of the unsuspecting Early.By four o'clock he had
reached the east face of Little North Mountain, to the left and rear of
the Confederates.While the movement was being made, the main body of the
Federal army was engaging the attention of the Confederates in front.Just
before sundown, Crook's men plunged down the mountain side, from out of
the timbered cover.The Confederates were quick to see that they had been
trapped.They had been caught in a pocket and there was nothing for them
to do except to retreat or surrender.They preferred the former, which
was, according to General Gordon, "first stubborn and slow, then rapid,
then--a rout."After the battle of Fisher's Hill the pursuit still continued.The
Confederate regiments re-formed, and at times would stop and contest the
approach of the advancing cavalrymen.By the time the Union infantry would
reach the place, the retreating army would have vanished.Torbert had been
sent down Luray Valley in pursuit of the Confederate cavalry, with the
hope of scattering it and seizing New Market in time to cut off the
Confederate retreat from Fisher's Hill.But at Milford, in a narrow gorge,
General Wickham held Torbert and prevented the fulfilment of his plan; and
General Early's whole force was able to escape.Day after day this
continued until Early had taken refuge in the Blue Ridge in front of
Brown's Gap.Sheridan in the mean time
had gone into camp at Harrisonburg, and for some time the two armies lay
watching each other.The Federals were having difficulty in holding their
lines of supply.With the Valley practically given up by Early, Sheridan was anxious to
stop here.He wrote to Grant, "I think the best policy will be to let the
burning of the crops in the Valley be the end of the campaign, and let
some of this army go somewhere else."Grant's consent to this plan reached him on October 5th, and the following
day he started on his return march down the Shenandoah.His cavalry
extended across the entire valley.With the unsparing severity of war, his
men began to make a barren waste of the region.The October sky was
overcast with clouds of smoke and sheets of flame from the burning barns
and mills.As the army of Sheridan proceeded down the Valley, the undaunted cavaliers
of Early came in pursuit.His horsemen kept close to the rear of the Union
columns.On the morning of October 9th, the cavalry leader, Rosser, who
had succeeded Wickham, found himself confronted by General Custer's
division, at Tom's Brook.At the same time the Federal general, Wesley
Merritt, fell upon the cavalry of Lomax and Johnson on an adjacent road.The two Union forces were soon united and a mounted battle ensued.The
ground being level, the maneuvering of the squadrons was easy.The clink
of the sabers rang out in the morning air.The Confederate center held together, but its flanks gave way.The Federals charged along the whole front, with a momentum that forced
the Southern cavalrymen to flee from the field.They left in the hands of
the Federal troopers over three hundred prisoners, all their artillery,
except one piece, and nearly every wagon the Confederate cavalry had with
them.The Northern army continued its retrograde movement, and on the 10th
crossed to the north side of Cedar Creek.Early's army in the mean time
had taken a position at the wooded base of Fisher's Hill, four miles
away.The Sixth Corps started for Washington, but the news of Early at
Fisher's Hill led to its recall.The Union forces occupied ground that was
considered practically unassailable, especially on the left, where the
deep gorge of the Shenandoah, along whose front rose the bold Massanutten
Mountain, gave it natural protection.The movements of the Confederate army were screened by the wooded ravines
in front of Fisher's Hill, while, from the summit of the neighboring Three
Top Mountain, its officers could view, as in a panorama, the entire Union
camp.Seemingly secure, the corps of Crook on the left of the Union line
was not well protected.The keen-eyed Gordon saw the weak point in the
Union position.Ingenious plans to break it down were quickly made.Meanwhile, Sheridan was summoned to Washington to consult with Secretary
Stanton.He did not believe that Early proposed an immediate attack, and
started on the 15th, escorted by the cavalry, and leaving General Wright
in command.At Front Royal the next day word came from Wright enclosing a
message taken for the Confederate signal-flag on Three Top Mountain.It
was from Longstreet, advising Early that he would join him and crush
Sheridan.The latter sent the cavalry back to Wright, and continued on to
Washington, whence he returned at once by special train, reaching
Winchester on the evening of the 18th.Just after dark on October 18th, a part of Early's army under the command
of General John B. Gordon, with noiseless steps, moved out from their
camp, through the misty, autumn night.The men had been stripped of their
canteens, in fear that the striking of them against some object might
reveal their movements.Their path
followed along the base of the mountain--a dim and narrow trail, upon
which but one man might pass at a time.For seven miles this sinuous line
made its way through the dark gorge, crossing the Shenandoah, and at
times passing within four hundred yards of the Union pickets.It arrived at the appointed place, opposite Crook's camp on the Federal
right, an hour before the attack was to be made.In the shivering air of
the early morning, the men crouched on the river bank, waiting for the
coming of the order to move forward.At last, at five o'clock, it came.They plunged into the frosty water of the river, emerged on the other
side, marched in "double quick," and were soon sounding a reveille to the
sleeping troops of Sheridan.The minie balls whizzed and sang through the
tents.In the gray mists of the dawn the legions of the South looked like
phantom warriors, as they poured through the unmanned gaps.The
Northerners sprang to arms.Their eyes saw the flames from the Southern muskets; the men felt the
breath of the hot muzzles in their faces, while the Confederate bayonets
were at their breasts.There was a brief struggle, then panic and
disorganization.Only a quarter of an hour of this yelling and struggling,
and two-thirds of the Union army broke like a mill-dam and poured across
the fields, leaving their accouterments of war and the stiffening bodies
of their comrades.Rosser, with the cavalry, attacked Custer and assisted
Gordon.Meanwhile, during these same early morning hours, General Early had
himself advanced to Cedar Creek by a more direct route.At half-past three
o'clock his men had come in sight of the Union camp-fires.They waited
under cover for the approach of day.At the first blush of dawn and before
the charge of Gordon, Early hurled his men across the stream, swept over
the breastworks, captured the batteries and turned them upon the
unsuspecting Northerners.The Federal generals tried to stem the impending
disaster.From the east of the battlefield the solid lines of Gordon were
now driving the fugitives of Crook's corps by the mere force of momentum.Aides were darting hither and thither, trying to reassemble the crumbling
lines.The Nineteenth Corps, under Emory, tried to hold its ground; for a
time it fought alone, but after a desperate effort to hold its own, it,
too, melted away under the scorching fire.The fields to the rear of the
army were covered with wagons, ambulances, stragglers, and fleeing
soldiers.As it slowly fell to the rear it
would, at times, turn to fight.At last it found a place where it again
stood at bay.The men hastily gathered rails and constructed rude
field-works.At the same time the Confederates paused in their advance.There was scarcely any firing except for
the occasional roar of a long-range artillery gun.The Southerners seemed
willing to rest on their well-earned laurels of the morning.In the
language of the successful commander, it was "glory enough for one day."But the brilliant morning victory was about to be changed to a singular
afternoon defeat.During the morning's fight, when the Union troops were
being rapidly overwhelmed with panic, Rienzi, the beautiful jet-black
war-charger, was bearing his master, the commander of the Federal army, to
the field of disaster.Along the broad valley highway that leads from
Winchester, General Sheridan had galloped to where his embattled lines had
been reduced to a flying mob.While riding leisurely away from Winchester
about nine o'clock he had heard unmistakable thunder-peals of artillery.Realizing that a battle was on in the front, he hastened forward, soon to
be met, as he crossed Mill Creek, by the trains and men of his routed
army, coming to the rear with appalling rapidity.News from the field told him of the crushing defeat of his hitherto
invincible regiments.The road was blocked by the retreating crowds as
they pressed toward the rear.The commander was forced to take to the
fields, and as his steed, flecked with foam, bore him onward, the
disheartened refugees greeted him with cheers.Taking off his hat as he
rode, he cried, "We will go back and recover our camps."The words seemed
to inspire the demoralized soldiers.Stragglers fell into line behind him;
men turned to follow their magnetic leader back to the fight.Vaulting his horse over the low barricade of rails, he dashed to the crest
of the field.There was a flutter along the battle-line.The men from
behind their protecting wall broke into thunderous cheers.From the rear
of the soldiers there suddenly arose, as from the earth, a line of the
regimental flags, which waved recognition to their leader.Early made another assault
after one o'clock, but was easily repulsed.It was nearly four o'clock when the order for the Federal advance was
given.General Sheridan, hat in hand, rode in front of his infantry line
that his men might see him.The Confederate forces now occupied a series
of wooded crests.From out of the shadow of one of these timbered coverts,
a column of gray was emerging.The Union lines stood waiting for the
impending crash.It came in a devouring succession of volleys that
reverberated into a deep and sullen roar.The Union infantry rose as one
man and passed in among the trees.Then, suddenly,
there came a screaming, humming rush of shell, a roar of musketry mingling
with the yells of a successful charge.Again the firing ceased, except for
occasional outbursts.The Confederates had taken a new position and
reopened with a galling fire.General Sheridan dashed along the front of
his lines in personal charge of the attack.Again his men moved toward the
lines of Early's fast thinning ranks.The Union
cavalry swept in behind the fleeing troops of Early and sent, again, his
veteran army "whirling up the Valley."The battle of Cedar Creek was ended; the tumult died away.The Federal
loss had been about fifty-seven hundred; the Confederate over three
thousand.Fourteen hundred Union prisoners were sent to Richmond.Never
again would the gaunt specter of war hover over Washington.[Illustration: GENERAL JUBAL A. EARLY, THE CONFEDERATE RAIDER WHO

years of age when he made the brilliant Valley campaign of the summer of
1864, which was halted only by the superior forces of Sheridan.A West
Point graduate and a veteran of the Mexican War, Early became, after the
death of Jackson, one of Lee's most efficient subordinates.He was alert,
aggressive, resourceful.His very eccentricities, perhaps, made him all
the more successful as a commander of troops in the field."Old Jube's"
caustic wit and austere ways made him a terror to stragglers, and who

it was still an unfinished structure, betraying its incompleteness to
every beholder.This picture shows the derrick on the dome.It is a view
of the east front of the building and was taken on July 11, 1863.Washington society had not been wholly free from occasional "war scares"
since the withdrawal of most of the troops whose duty it had been to guard
the city.Early's approach in July, 1864, found the Nation's capital
entirely unprotected.Naturally there was a flutter throughout the
peaceable groups of non-combatants that made up the population of
Washington at that time, as well as in official circles.There were less
than seventy thousand people living in the city in 1864, a large
proportion of whom were in some way connected with the Government.[Illustration: PROTECTING LOCOMOTIVES FROM THE CONFEDERATE RAIDER

such an attack as Early might be expected to make.Not only were these
guns hard to move to points of danger, but in the summer of '64 there were
no trained artillerists to man them.Big as they were, they gave Early no
occasion for alarm.[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO WASHINGTON FROM THE SOUTH--THE FAMOUS "CHAIN
BRIDGE"

reason why Early did not make his approach to the capital from the

the roads to Long Bridge (shown below), and there was no way of marching
troops into the city from the south, excepting over such exposed passages.Most of the troops left for the defense of the city were on the Virginia
side.Therefore Early wisely picked out the northern outposts as the more
vulnerable.Long Bridge was closely guarded at all times, like Chain
Bridge and the other approaches, and at night the planks of its floor were
removed.[Illustration: LONG BRIDGE AND THE CAPITOL ACROSS THE BROAD POTOMAC

INSIDE FORT TOTTEN--THREE SHIFTING SCENES IN A BIG-GUN DRILL

Constant drill at the guns went on in the defenses of Washington
throughout the war.At its close in April, 1865, there were 68 enclosed
forts and batteries, whose aggregate perimeter was thirteen miles, 807
guns and 98 mortars mounted, and emplacements for 1,120 guns, ninety-three
unarmed batteries for field-guns, 35,711 yards of rifle-trenches, and
three block-houses encircling the Northern capital.The entire extent of
front of the lines was thirty-seven miles; and thirty-two miles of
military roads, besides those previously existing in the District of
Columbia, formed the means of interior communication.In all these forts
constant preparation was made for a possible onslaught of the
Confederates, and many of the troops were trained which later went to take
part in the siege of Petersburg where the heavy artillery fought bravely
as infantry.[Illustration]

After the disastrous clash of the two armies at Cold Harbor, Grant
remained a few days in his entrenchments trying in vain to find a weak
place in Lee's lines.The combatants were now due east of Richmond, and
the Federal general realized that it would be impossible at this time to
attain the object for which he had struggled ever since he crossed the
Rapidan on the 4th of May--to turn Lee's right flank and interpose his
forces between the Army of Northern Virginia and the capital of the
Confederacy.His opponent, one of the very greatest military leaders the
Anglo-Saxon race has produced, with an army of but little more than half
the number of the Federal host, had successfully blocked the attempts to
carry out this plan in three great battles and by a remarkable maneuver on
the southern bank of the North Anna, which had forced Grant to recross the
river and which will always remain a subject of curious interest to
students of the art of war.In one month the Union army had lost fifty-five thousand men, while the
Confederate losses had been comparatively small.The cost to the North had
been too great; Lee could not be cut off from his capital, and the most
feasible project was now to join in the move which heretofore had been the
special object of General Butler and the Army of the James, and attack
Richmond itself.South of the city, at a distance of twenty-one miles, was
the town of Petersburg.Its defenses were not strong, although General
Gillmore of Butler's army had failed in an attempt to seize them on the
10th of June.Three railroads converged here and these were main arteries
of Lee's supply.He sent
General W. F. Smith, who had come to his aid at Cold Harbor with the
flower of the Army of the James, back to Bermuda Hundred by water, as he
had come, with instructions to hasten to Petersburg before Lee could get
there.Smith arrived on the 15th and was joined by Hancock with the first
troops of the Army of the Potomac to appear, but the attack was not
pressed and Beauregard who, with only two thousand men, was in desperate
straits until Lee should reach him, managed to hold the inner line of
trenches.The last of Grant's forces were across the James by midnight of June 16th,
while Lee took a more westerly and shorter route to Petersburg.The
fighting there was continued as the two armies came up, but each Union
attack was successfully repulsed.At the close of day on the 18th both
opponents were in full strength and the greatest struggle of modern times
was begun.Impregnable bastioned works began to show themselves around
Petersburg.More than thirty miles of frowning redoubts connected
extensive breastworks and were strengthened by mortar batteries and
field-works which lined the fields near the Appomattox River.It was a
vast net of fortifications, but there was no formal siege of Lee's
position, which was a new entrenched line selected by Beauregard some
distance behind the rifle-pits where he had held out at such great odds
against Hancock and Smith.Grant, as soon as the army was safely protected, started to extend his
lines on the west and south, in order to envelop the Confederate right
flank.He also bent his energies to destroying the railroads upon which
Lee depended for supplies.On
June 22d two corps of the Union army set out for the Weldon Railroad, but
they became separated and were put to flight by A. P. Hill.The Federal
cavalry also joined in the work, but the vigilant Confederate horsemen
under W. H. F. Lee prevented any serious damage to the iron way, and by
July 2d the last of the raiders were back in the Federal lines, much the
worse for the rough treatment they had received.Now ensued some weeks of quiet during which both armies were
strengthening their fortifications.On June 25th Sheridan returned from
his cavalry raid on the Virginia Central Railroad running north from
Richmond.He had encountered Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee at Trevilian Station
on June 11th, and turned back after doing great damage to the railway.Ammunition was running short and he did not dare risk another engagement.Sheridan was destined not to remain long with the army in front of
Petersburg.Lee had detached a corps from his forces and, under Early, it
had been doing great damage in Maryland and Pennsylvania.So Grant's
cavalry leader was put at the head of an army and sent to the Shenandoah
valley to drive Early's troops from the base of their operations.Meanwhile the Federals were covertly engaged in an undertaking which was
fated to result in conspicuous failure.Some skilled miners from the upper
Schuylkill coal regions in the Forty-eighth Pennsylvania attached to the
Ninth Corps were boring a tunnel from the rear of the Union works
underneath the Confederate fortifications.Eight thousand pounds of
gunpowder were placed in lateral galleries at the end of the tunnel.At
twenty minutes to five on the morning of July 30th, the mine was exploded.A solid mass of earth and all manner of material shot two hundred feet
into the air.Three hundred human beings were buried in the debris as it
fell back into the gaping crater.The smoke had barely cleared away when
General Ledlie led his waiting troops into the vast opening.The horror of
the sight sickened the assailants, and in crowding into the pit they
became completely demoralized.In the confusion officers lost power to
reorganize, much less to control, their troops.The stunned and paralyzed Confederates were not long in recovering their
wits.Batteries opened upon the approach to the crater, and presently a
stream of fire was poured into the pit itself.General Mahone hastened up
with his Georgia and Virginia troops, and there were several desperate
charges before the Federals withdrew at Burnside's order.Grant had had
great expectations that the mine would result in his capturing Petersburg
and he was much disappointed.In order to get a part of Lee's army away
from the scene of what he hoped would be the final struggle, Hancock's
troops and a large force of cavalry had been sent north of the James, as
if a move on Richmond had been planned.In the mine fiasco on that fatal
July 30th, thirty-nine hundred men (nearly all from Burnside's corps) were
lost to the Union side.In the torrid days of mid-August Grant renewed his attacks upon the Weldon
Railroad, and General Warren was sent to capture it.He reached Globe
Tavern, about four miles from Petersburg, when he encountered General
Heth, who drove him back.Warren did not return to the Federal lines but
entrenched along the iron way.The next day he was fiercely attacked by
the Confederate force now strongly reenforced by Mahone.Mahone forced his way through the skirmish line and then
turned and fought his opponents from their rear.Another of his divisions
struck the Union right wing.In this extremity two thousand of Warren's
troops were captured and all would have been lost but for the timely
arrival of Burnside's men.Two days later the Southerners renewed the battle and now thirty cannon
poured volley after volley upon the Fifth and Ninth corps.The dashing
Mahone again came forward with his usual impetuousness, but the blue line
finally drove Lee's men back.And so the Weldon Railroad fell into the
hands of General Grant.Hancock, with the Second Corps, returned from the
north bank of the James and set to work to assist in destroying the
railway, whose loss was a hard blow to General Lee.It was not to be
expected that the latter would permit this work to continue unmolested and
on the 25th of August, A. P. Hill suddenly confronted Hancock, who
entrenched himself in haste at Ream's Station.This did not save the
Second Corps, which for the first time in its glorious career was put to
rout.Their very guns were captured and turned upon them.In the following weeks there were no actions of importance except that in
the last days of September Generals Ord and Birney, with the Army of the
James, captured Fort Harrison, on the north bank of that river, from
Generals Ewell and Anderson.The Federals were anxious to have it, since
it was an excellent vantage point from which to threaten Richmond.Meanwhile Grant was constantly extending his line to the west and by the
end of October it was very close to the South Side Railroad.On the 27th
there was a hard fight at Hatcher's Run, but the Confederates saved the
railway and the Federals returned to their entrenchments in front of
Petersburg.The active struggle now ceased, but Lee found himself each day in more
desperate straits.Sheridan had played sad havoc with such sources of
supply as existed in the rich country to the northwest.The Weldon
Railroad was gone and the South Side line was in imminent danger.Many went home for the winter on a promise
to return when the spring planting was done.Lee was loath to let them go,
but he could ill afford to maintain them, and the very life of their
families depended upon it.Those who remained at Petersburg suffered
cruelly from hunger and cold.They looked forward to the spring, although
it meant renewal of the mighty struggle.The Confederate line had been
stretched to oppose Grant's westward progress until it had become the
thinnest of screens.A man lost to Lee was almost impossible to replace,
while the bounties offered in the North kept Grant's ranks full.[Illustration: MAHONE, "THE HERO OF THE CRATER"

of General Mahone that the Southerners, on July 30, 1864, were enabled to
turn back upon the Federals the disaster threatened by the hidden mine.On
the morning of the explosion there were but eighteen thousand Confederates
left to hold the ten miles of lines about Petersburg.Everything seemed to
favor Grant's plans for the crushing of this force.Immediately after the
mine was sprung, a terrific cannonade was opened from one hundred and
fifty guns and mortars to drive back the Confederates from the breach,
while fifty thousand Federals stood ready to charge upon the
panic-stricken foe.But the foe was not panic-stricken long.Colonel
McMaster, of the Seventeenth South Carolina, gathered the remnants of
General Elliott's brigade and held back the Federals massing at the Crater
until General Mahone arrived at the head of three brigades.At once he
prepared to attack the Federals, who at that moment were advancing to the
left of the Crater.In his inspiring
presence it swept with such vigor that the Federals were driven back and
dared not risk another assault.At the Crater, Lee had what Grant
lacked--a man able to direct the entire engagement.[Illustration: WHAT EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS OF POWDER DID

great mass of earth hurled skyward like a water-spout.As it spread out
into an immense cloud, scattering guns, carriages, timbers, and what were
once human beings, the front ranks broke in panic; it looked as if the
mass were descending upon their own heads.The men were quickly rallied;
across the narrow plain they charged, through the awful breach, and up the
heights beyond to gain Cemetery Ridge.But there were brave fighters on
the other side still left, and delay among the Federals enabled the
Confederates to rally and re-form in time to drive the Federals back down
the steep sides of the Crater.There, as they struggled amidst the
horrible debris, one disaster after another fell upon them.Huddled
together, the mass of men was cut to pieces by the canister poured upon
them from well-planted Confederate batteries.At last, as a forlorn hope,
the <DW52> troops were sent forward; and they, too, were hurled back into
the Crater and piled upon their white comrades.[Illustration: FORT MAHONE--"FORT DAMNATION"

while Fort Sedgwick, which was no less active in reply, was known to the
Confederates as Fort Hell.Gracie's salient, further north on the

desperate effort of the Confederates to break through the Federal cordon.The views of Gracie's salient show the French form of chevaux-de-frise, a

SHERMAN'S FINAL CAMPAIGNS

    I only regarded the march from Atlanta to Savannah as a "shift of
    base," as the transfer of a strong army, which had no opponent, and
    had finished its then work, from the interior to a point on the sea
    coast, from which it could achieve other important results.I
    considered this march as a means to an end, and not as an essential
    act of war.Still, then as now, the march to the sea was generally
    regarded as something extraordinary, something anomalous, something
    out of the usual order of events; whereas, in fact, I simply moved
    from Atlanta to Savannah, as one step in the direction of Richmond, a
    movement that had to be met and defeated, or the war was necessarily
    at an end.--_General W. T. Sherman, in his "Memoirs."_


The march to the sea, in which General William T. Sherman won undying fame
in the Civil War, is one of the greatest pageants in the world's
warfare--as fearful in its destruction as it is historic in its import.But this was not Sherman's chief achievement; it was an easy task compared
with the great campaign between Chattanooga and Atlanta through which he
had just passed."As a military accomplishment it was little more than a
grand picnic," declared one of his division commanders, in speaking of the
march through Georgia and the Carolinas.Almost immediately after the capture of Atlanta, Sherman, deciding to
remain there for some time and to make it a Federal military center,
ordered all the inhabitants to be removed.General Hood pronounced the act
one of ingenious cruelty, transcending any that had ever before come to
his notice in the dark history of the war.Sherman insisted that his act
was one of kindness, and that Johnston and Hood themselves had done the
same--removed families from their homes--in other places.Many of the people of Atlanta chose to go southward,
others to the north, the latter being transported free, by Sherman's
order, as far as Chattanooga.Shortly after the middle of September, Hood moved his army from Lovejoy's
Station, just south of Atlanta, to the vicinity of Macon.Here Jefferson
Davis visited the encampment, and on the 22d he made a speech to the
homesick Army of Tennessee, which, reported in the Southern newspapers,
disclosed to Sherman the new plans of the Confederate leaders.These
involved nothing less than a fresh invasion of Tennessee, which, in the
opinion of President Davis, would put Sherman in a predicament worse than
that in which Napoleon found himself at Moscow.But, forewarned, the
Federal leader prepared to thwart his antagonists.The line of the Western
and Atlantic Railroad was more closely guarded.Divisions were sent to
Rome and to Chattanooga.Thomas was ordered to Nashville, and Schofield to
Knoxville.Recruits were hastened from the North to these points, in order
that Sherman himself might not be weakened by the return of too many
troops to these places.Hood, in the hope of leading Sherman away from Atlanta, crossed the
Chattahoochee on the 1st of October, destroyed the railroad above Marietta
and sent General French against Allatoona.It was the brave defense of
this place by General John M. Corse that brought forth Sherman's famous
message, "Hold out; relief is coming," sent by his signal officers from
the heights of Kenesaw Mountain, and which thrilled the North and inspired
its poets to eulogize Corse's bravery in verse.Corse had been ordered
from Rome to Allatoona by signals from mountain to mountain, over the
heads of the Confederate troops, who occupied the valley between.Reaching
the mountain pass soon after midnight, on October 5th, Corse added his
thousand men to the nine hundred already there, and soon after daylight
the battle began.General French, in command of the Confederates, first
summoned Corse to surrender, and, receiving a defiant answer, opened with
his guns.Nearly all the day the fire was terrific from besieged and
besiegers, and the losses on both sides were very heavy.During the battle Sherman was on Kenesaw Mountain, eighteen miles away,
from which he could see the cloud of smoke and hear the faint
reverberation of the cannons' boom.When he learned by signal that Corse
was there and in command, he said, "If Corse is there, he will hold out; I
know the man."And he did hold out, and saved the stores at Allatoona, at
a loss of seven hundred of his men, he himself being among the wounded,
while French lost about eight hundred.General Hood continued to move northward to Resaca and Dalton, passing
over the same ground on which the two great armies had fought during the
spring and summer.He destroyed the railroads, burned the ties, and
twisted the rails, leaving greater havoc, if possible, in a country that
was already a wilderness of desolation.For some weeks Sherman followed
Hood in the hope that a general engagement would result.He went on to the banks of the Tennessee opposite
Florence, Alabama.His army was lightly equipped, and Sherman, with his
heavily burdened troops, was unable to catch him.Sherman halted at
Gaylesville and ordered Schofield, with the Twenty-third Corps, and
Stanley, with the Fourth Corps, to Thomas at Nashville.Sherman thereupon determined to return to Atlanta, leaving General Thomas
to meet Hood's appearance in Tennessee.It was about this time that
Sherman fully decided to march to the sea.Some time before this he had
telegraphed to Grant: "Hood... can constantly break my roads.I would
infinitely prefer to make a wreck of the road... send back all my wounded
and worthless, and, with my effective army, move through Georgia, smashing
things to the sea."Grant thought it best for Sherman to destroy Hood's
army first, but Sherman insisted that his plan would put him on the
offensive rather than the defensive.He also believed that Hood would be
forced to follow him.Grant was finally won to the view that if Hood moved
on Tennessee, Thomas would be able to check him.He had, on the 11th of
October, given permission for the march.Now, on the 2d of November, he
telegraphed Sherman at Rome: "I do not really see that you can withdraw
from where you are to follow Hood without giving up all we have gained in
territory.I say, then, go on as you propose."It was Sherman, and not
Grant or Lincoln, that conceived the great march, and while the march
itself was not seriously opposed or difficult to carry out, the conception
and purpose were masterly.Sherman moved his army by slow and easy stages back to Atlanta.He sent
the vast army stores that had collected at Atlanta, which he could not
take with him, as well as his sick and wounded, to Chattanooga, destroyed
the railroad to that place, also the machine-shops at Rome and other
places, and on November 12th, after receiving a final despatch from Thomas
and answering simply, "Despatch received--all right," the last telegraph
line was severed, and Sherman had deliberately cut himself off from all
communication with the Northern States.There is no incident like it in
the annals of war.A strange event it was, as Sherman observes in his
memoirs."Two hostile armies marching in opposite directions, each in the
full belief that it was achieving a final and conclusive result in a great
war."For the next two days all was astir in Atlanta.The great depot,
round-house, and machine-shops were destroyed.Walls were battered down;
chimneys pulled over; machinery smashed to pieces, and boilers punched
full of holes.Heaps of rubbish covered the spots where these fine
buildings had stood, and on the night of November 15th the vast debris was
set on fire.The torch was also applied to many places in the business
part of the city, in defiance of the strict orders of Captain Poe, who
had the work of destruction in charge.The court-house and a large part of
the dwellings escaped the flames.Preparations for the great march were made with extreme care.Defective
wagons and horses were discarded; the number of heavy guns to be carried
along was sixty-five, the remainder having been sent to Chattanooga.The
marching army numbered about sixty thousand, five thousand of whom
belonged to the cavalry and eighteen hundred to the artillery.The army
was divided into two immense wings, the Right, the Army of the Tennessee,
commanded by General O. O. Howard, and consisting of the Fifteenth and
Seventeenth corps, and the Left, the Army of Georgia, by General Henry W.
Slocum, composed the Fourteenth and Twentieth corps.There were twenty-five hundred wagons, each drawn by
six mules; six hundred ambulances, with two horses each, while the heavy
guns, caissons, and forges were each drawn by eight horses.A twenty days'
supply of bread, forty of coffee, sugar, and salt was carried with the
army, and a large herd of cattle was driven on foot.In Sherman's general instructions it was provided that the army should
march by four roads as nearly parallel as possible, except the cavalry,
which remained under the direct control of the general commanding.The
army was directed "to forage liberally on the country," but, except along
the roadside, this was to be done by organized foraging parties appointed
by the brigade commanders.Orders were issued forbidding soldiers to enter
private dwellings or to commit any trespass.The corps commanders were
given the option of destroying mills, cotton-gins, and the like, and where
the army was molested in its march by the burning of bridges, obstructing
the roads, and so forth, the devastation should be made "more or less
relentless, according to the measure of such hostility."The cavalry and
artillery and the foraging parties were permitted to take horses, mules,
and wagons from the inhabitants without limit, except that they were to
discriminate in favor of the poor.It was a remarkable military
undertaking, in which it was intended to remove restrictions only to a
sufficient extent to meet the requirements of the march.The cavalry was
commanded by General Judson Kilpatrick, who, after receiving a severe
wound at Resaca, in May, had gone to his home on the banks of the Hudson,
in New York, to recuperate, and, against the advice of his physician, had
joined the army again at Atlanta.On November 15th, most of the great army was started on its march, Sherman
himself riding out from the city next morning.As he rode near the spot
where General McPherson had fallen, he paused and looked back at the
receding city with its smoking ruins, its blackened walls, and its lonely,
tenantless houses.The vision of the desperate battles, of the hope and
fear of the past few months, rose before him, as he tells us, "like the
memory of a dream."The day was as perfect as Nature ever gives.They sang and shouted and waved their banners in the
autumn breeze.Most of them supposed they were going directly toward
Richmond, nearly a thousand miles away.As Sherman rode past them they
would call out, "Uncle Billy, I guess Grant is waiting for us at
Richmond."Only the commanders of the wings and Kilpatrick were entrusted
with the secret of Sherman's intentions.But even Sherman was not fully
decided as to his objective--Savannah, Georgia, or Port Royal, South
Carolina--until well on the march.There was one certainty, however--he was fully decided to keep the
Confederates in suspense as to his intentions.To do this the more
effectually he divided his army at the start, Howard leading his wing to
Gordon by way of McDonough as if to threaten Macon, while Slocum proceeded
to Covington and Madison, with Milledgeville as his goal.Both were
secretly instructed to halt, seven days after starting, at Gordon and
Milledgeville, the latter the capital of Georgia, about a hundred miles to
the southeast.General Hood and General Beauregard, who had come from the East to assist
him, were in Tennessee, and it was some days after Sherman had left
Atlanta that they heard of his movements.They realized that to follow him
would now be futile.He was nearly three hundred miles away, and not only
were the railroads destroyed, but a large part of the intervening country
was utterly laid waste and incapable of supporting an army.The
Confederates thereupon turned their attention to Thomas, who was also in
Tennessee, and was the barrier between Hood and the Northern States.General Sherman accompanied first one corps of his army and then another.The first few days he spent with Davis' corps of Slocum's wing.When they
reached Covington, the <DW64>s met the troops in great numbers, shouting
and thanking the Lord that "deliverance" had come at last.As Sherman rode
along the streets they would gather around his horse and exhibit every
evidence of adoration.The foraging parties consisted of companies of fifty men.Their route for
the day in which they obtained supplies was usually parallel to that of
the army, five or six miles from it.They would start out before daylight
in the morning, many of them on foot; but when they rejoined the column in
the evening they were no longer afoot.They were astride mules, horses, in
family carriages, farm wagons, and mule carts, which they packed with
hams, bacon, vegetables, chickens, ducks, and every imaginable product of
a Southern farm that could be useful to an army.In the general orders, Sherman had forbidden the soldiers to enter private
houses; but the order was not strictly adhered to, as many Southern people
have since testified.Sherman declares in his memoirs that these acts of
pillage and violence were exceptional and incidental.On one occasion
Sherman saw a man with a ham on his musket, a jug of molasses under his
arm, and a big piece of honey in his hand.As the man saw that he was
observed by the commander, he quoted audibly to a comrade, from the
general order, "forage liberally on the country."But the general reproved
him and explained that foraging must be carried on only by regularly
designated parties.It is a part of military history that Sherman's sole purpose was to weaken
the Confederacy by recognized means of honorable warfare; but it cannot be
denied that there were a great many instances, unknown to him,
undoubtedly, of cowardly hold-ups of the helpless inhabitants, or
ransacking of private boxes and drawers in search of jewelry and other
family treasure.This is one of the misfortunes of war--one of war's
injustices.Such practices always exist even under the most rigid
discipline in great armies, and the jubilation of this march was such that
human nature asserted itself in the license of warfare more than on most
other occasions.General Washington met with similar situations in the
American Revolution.The practice is never confined to either army in
warfare.Opposed to Sherman were Wheeler's cavalry, and a large portion of the
Georgia State troops which were turned over by General G. W. Smith to
General Howell Cobb.Kilpatrick and his horsemen, proceeding toward Macon,
were confronted by Wheeler and Cobb, but the Federal troopers drove them
back into the town.However, they issued forth again, and on November 21st
there was a sharp engagement with Kilpatrick at Griswoldville.The
following day the Confederates were definitely checked and retreated.The night of November 22d, Sherman spent in the home of General Cobb, who
had been a member of the United States Congress and of Buchanan's Cabinet.Thousands of soldiers encamped that night on Cobb's plantation, using his
fences for camp-fire fuel.By Sherman's order, everything on the
plantation movable or destructible was carried away next day, or
destroyed.By the next night both corps of the Left Wing were at Milledgeville, and
on the 24th started for Sandersville.Howard's wing was at Gordon, and it
left there on the day that Slocum moved from Milledgeville for Irwin's
Crossroads.A hundred miles below Milledgeville was a place called Millen,
and here were many Federal prisoners which Sherman greatly desired to
release.With this in view he sent Kilpatrick toward Augusta to give the
impression that the army was marching thither, lest the Confederates
should remove the prisoners from Millen.Kilpatrick had reached Waynesboro
when he learned that the prisoners had been taken away.Here he again
encountered the Confederate cavalry under General Wheeler.A sharp fight
ensued and Kilpatrick drove Wheeler through the town toward Augusta.As
there was no further need of making a feint on Augusta, Kilpatrick turned
back toward the Left Wing.Wheeler quickly followed and at Thomas' Station
nearly surrounded him, but Kilpatrick cut his way out.Wheeler still
pressed on and Kilpatrick chose a good position at Buck Head Creek,
dismounted, and threw up breastworks.Wheeler attacked desperately, but
was repulsed, and Kilpatrick, after being reenforced by a brigade from
Davis' corps, joined the Left Wing at Louisville.On the whole, the great march was but little disturbed by the
Confederates.The Georgia militia, probably ten thousand in all, did what
they could to defend their homes and their firesides; but their endeavors
were futile against the vast hosts that were sweeping through the country.In the skirmishes that took place between Atlanta and the sea the militia
was soon brushed aside.Even their destroying of bridges and supplies in
front of the invading army checked its progress but for a moment, as it
was prepared for every such emergency.Wheeler, with his cavalry, caused
more trouble, and engaged Kilpatrick's attention a large part of the time.But even he did not seriously <DW44> the irresistible progress of the
legions of the North.The great army kept on its way by various routes, covering about fifteen
miles a day, and leaving a swath of destruction, from forty to sixty miles
wide, in its wake.Among the details attendant upon the march to the sea
was that of scientifically destroying the railroads that traversed the
region.Battalions of engineers had received special instruction in the
art, together with the necessary implements to facilitate rapid work.But
the infantry soon entered this service, too, and it was a common sight to
see a thousand soldiers in blue standing beside a stretch of railway, and,
when commanded, bend as one man and grasp the rail, and at a second
command to raise in unison, which brought a thousand railroad ties up on
end.Then the men fell upon them, ripping rail and tie apart, the rails to
be heated to a white heat and bent in fantastic shapes about some
convenient tree or other upright column, the ties being used as the fuel
with which to make the fires.All public buildings that might have a
military use were burned, together with a great number of private
dwellings and barns, some by accident, others wantonly.This fertile and
prosperous region, after the army had passed, was a scene of ruin and
desolation.As the army progressed, throngs of escaped slaves followed in its trail,
"from the baby in arms to the old <DW64> hobbling painfully along," says
General Howard, "<DW64>s of all sizes, in all sorts of patched costumes,
with carts and broken-down horses and mules to match."Many of the old
<DW64>s found it impossible to keep pace with the army for many days, and
having abandoned their homes and masters who could have cared for them,
they were left to die of hunger and exposure in that naked land.After the Ogeechee River was crossed, the character of the country was
greatly changed from that of central Georgia.No longer were there fertile
farms, laden with their Southern harvests of corn and vegetables, but
rather rice plantations and great pine forests, the solemn stillness of
which was broken by the tread of thousands of troops, the rumbling of
wagon-trains, and by the shouts and music of the marching men and of the
motley crowd of <DW64>s that followed.Day by day Sherman issued orders for the progress of the wings, but on
December 2d they contained the decisive words, "Savannah."What a tempting
prize was this fine Southern city, and how the Northern commander would
add to his laurels could he effect its capture!The memories clinging
about the historic old town, with its beautiful parks and its
magnolia-lined streets, are part of the inheritance of not only the South,
but of all America.Here Oglethorpe had bartered with the wild men of the
forest, and here, in the days of the Revolution, Count Pulaski and
Sergeant Jasper had given up their lives in the cause of liberty.Sherman had partially invested the city before the middle of December; but
it was well fortified and he refrained from assault.General Hardee, sent
by Hood from Tennessee, had command of the defenses, with about eighteen
thousand men.And there was Fort McAllister on the Ogeechee, protecting
the city on the south.But this obstruction to the Federals was soon
removed.General Hazen's division of the Fifteenth Corps was sent to
capture the fort.At five o'clock in the afternoon of the 13th Hazen's men
rushed through a shower of grape, over abatis and hidden torpedoes, scaled
the parapet and captured the garrison.That night Sherman boarded the
_Dandelion_, a Union vessel, in the river, and sent a message to the
outside world, the first since he had left Atlanta.Henceforth there was communication between the army and the Federal
squadron, under the command of Admiral Dahlgren.Among the vessels that
came up the river there was one that was received with great enthusiasm by
the soldiers.It brought mail, tons of it, for Sherman's army, the
accumulation of two months.One can imagine the eagerness with which
these war-stained veterans opened the longed-for letters and sought the
answer to the ever-recurring question, "How are things at home?"Sherman had set his heart on capturing Savannah; but, on December 15th, he
received a letter from Grant which greatly disturbed him.Grant ordered
him to leave his artillery and cavalry, with infantry enough to support
them, and with the remainder of his army to come by sea to Virginia and
join the forces before Richmond.Sherman prepared to obey, but hoped that
he would be able to capture the city before the transports would be ready
to carry him northward.He first called on Hardee to surrender the city, with a threat of
bombardment.Sherman hesitated to open with his guns
because of the bloodshed it would occasion, and on December 21st he was
greatly relieved to discover that Hardee had decided not to defend the
city, that he had escaped with his army the night before, by the one road
that was still open to him, which led across the Savannah River into the
Carolinas.The stream had been spanned by an improvised pontoon bridge,
consisting of river-boats, with planks from city wharves for flooring and
with old car-wheels for anchors.Sherman immediately took possession of
the city, and on December 22d he sent to President Lincoln this message:
"I beg to present to you, as a Christmas gift, the city of Savannah, with
one hundred and fifty heavy guns and plenty of ammunition, and also about
twenty-five thousand bales of cotton."As a matter of fact, over two
hundred and fifty guns were captured, and thirty-one thousand bales of
cotton.Events in the West now changed Grant's views as to Sherman's joining him
immediately in Virginia.On the 16th of December, General Thomas
accomplished the defeat and utter rout of Hood's army at Nashville.In
addition, it was found that, owing to lack of transports, it would take at
least two months to transfer Sherman's whole army by sea.Therefore, it
was decided that Sherman should march through the Carolinas, destroying
the railroads in both States as he went.A little more than a month
Sherman remained in Savannah.Then he began another great march, compared
with which, as Sherman himself declared, the march to the sea was as
child's play.The size of his army on leaving Savannah was practically the
same as when he left Atlanta--sixty thousand.It was divided into two
wings, under the same commanders, Howard and Slocum, and was to be
governed by the same rules.The
march from Savannah averaged ten miles a day, which, in view of the
conditions, was a very high average.The weather in the early part of the
journey was exceedingly wet and the roads were well-nigh impassable.Where
they were not actually under water the mud rendered them impassable until
corduroyed.Moreover, the troops had to wade streams, to drag themselves
through swamps and quagmires, and to remove great trees that had been
felled across their pathway.The city of Savannah was left under the control of General J. G. Foster,
and the Left Wing of Sherman's army under Slocum moved up the Savannah
River, accompanied by Kilpatrick, and crossed it at Sister's Ferry.The
river was overflowing its banks and the crossing, by means of a pontoon
bridge, was effected with the greatest difficulty.The Right Wing, under
Howard, embarked for Beaufort, South Carolina, and moved thence to
Pocotaligo, near the Broad River, whither Sherman had preceded it, and the
great march northward was fairly begun by February 1, 1865.Sherman had given out the word that he expected to go to Charleston or
Augusta, his purpose being to deceive the Confederates, since he had made
up his mind to march straight to Columbia, the capital of South Carolina.The two wings of the army were soon united and they continued their great
march from one end of the State of South Carolina to the other.The men
felt less restraint in devastating the country and despoiling the people
than they had felt in Georgia.The reason for this, given by Sherman and
others, was that there was a feeling of bitterness against South Carolina
as against no other State.It was this State that had led the procession
of seceding States and that had fired on Fort Sumter and brought on the
great war.No doubt this feeling, which pervaded the army, will account in
part for the reckless dealing with the inhabitants by the Federal
soldiery.The superior officers, however, made a sincere effort to
restrain lawlessness.On February 17th, Sherman entered Columbia, the mayor having come out and
surrendered the city.The Fifteenth Corps marched through the city and out
on the Camden road, the remainder of the army not having come within two
miles of the city.The conflagration
spread and ere the coming of the morning the best part of the city had
been laid in ashes.Before Sherman left Columbia he destroyed the machine-shops and everything
else which might aid the Confederacy.He left with the mayor one hundred
stand of arms with which to keep order, and five hundred head of cattle
for the destitute.As Columbia was approached by the Federals, the occupation of Charleston
by the Confederates became more and more untenable.In vain had the
governor of South Carolina pleaded with President Davis to reenforce
General Hardee, who occupied the city.Hardee thereupon evacuated the
historic old city--much of which was burned, whether by design or accident
is not known--and its defenses, including Fort Sumter, the bombardment of
which, nearly four years before, had precipitated the mighty conflict,
were occupied by Colonel Bennett, who came over from Morris Island.On March 11th, Sherman reached Fayetteville, North Carolina, where he
destroyed a fine arsenal.Hitherto, Sherman's march, except for the
annoyance of Wheeler's cavalry, had been but slightly impeded by the
Confederates.General Joseph B.
Johnston, his old foe of Resaca and Kenesaw Mountain, had been recalled
and was now in command of the troops in the Carolinas.No longer would the
streams and the swamps furnish the only resistance to the progress of the
Union army.The first engagement came at Averysboro on March 16th.General Hardee,
having taken a strong position, made a determined stand; but a division of
Slocum's wing, aided by Kilpatrick, soon put him to flight, with the loss
of several guns and over two hundred prisoners.The battle of Bentonville, which took place three days after that of
Averysboro, was more serious.Johnston had placed his whole army, probably
thirty-five thousand men, in the form of a V, the sides embracing the
village of Bentonville.Slocum engaged the Confederates while Howard was
hurried to the scene.On two days, the 19th and 20th of March, Sherman's
army fought its last battle in the Civil War.But Johnston, after making
several attacks, resulting in considerable losses on both sides, withdrew
his army during the night, and the Union army moved to Goldsboro.The
losses at Bentonville were: Federal, 1,527; Confederate, 2,606.At Goldsboro the Union army was reenforced by its junction with Schofield,
who had come out of the West with over twenty-two thousand men from the
army of Thomas in Tennessee.Sherman's third great march was practically over.As to the relative
importance of the second and third, Sherman declares in his memoirs, he
would place that from Atlanta to the sea at one, and that from Savannah
through the Carolinas at ten.Leaving his army in charge of Schofield, Sherman went to City Point, in
Virginia, where he had a conference with General Grant and President
Lincoln, and plans for the final campaign were definitely arranged.He
returned to Goldsboro late in March, and, pursuing Johnston, received,
finally, on April 26th the surrender of his army.[Illustration: BEFORE THE MARCH TO THE SEA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]These two photographs of General Sherman were taken in 1864--the year that
made him an international figure, before his march to the sea which
electrified the civilized world, and exposed once for all the crippled
condition of the Confederacy.After that autumn expedition, the problem of
the Union generals was merely to contend with detached armies, no longer
with the combined States of the Confederacy.The latter had no means of
extending further support to the dwindling troops in the field.Sherman
was the chief Union exponent of the tactical gift that makes marches count
as much as fighting.In the early part of 1864 he made his famous raid
across Mississippi from Jackson to Meridian and back again, destroying the
railroads, Confederate stores, and other property, and desolating the
country along the line of march.In May he set out from Chattanooga for
the invasion of Georgia.For his success in this campaign he was
appointed, on August 12th, a major-general in the regular army.On
November 12th, he started with the pick of his men on his march to the
sea.After the capture of Savannah, December 21st, Sherman's fame was
secure; yet he was one of the most heartily execrated leaders of the war.There is a hint of a smile in the right-hand picture.The left-hand
portrait reveals all the sternness and determination of a leader
surrounded by dangers, about to penetrate an enemy's country against the
advice of accepted military authorities.[Illustration: THE ATLANTA BANK BEFORE THE MARCH TO THE SEA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]As this photograph was taken, the wagons stood in the street of Atlanta
ready to accompany the Federals in their impending march to the sea.The
most interesting thing is the bank building on the corner, completely
destroyed, although around it stand the stores of merchants entirely
untouched.Evidently there had been here faithful execution of Sherman's
orders to his engineers--to destroy all buildings and property of a public
nature, such as factories, foundries, railroad stations, and the like; but
to protect as far as possible strictly private dwellings and enterprises.Those of a later generation who witnessed the growth of Atlanta within
less than half a century after this photograph was taken, and saw tall
office-buildings and streets humming with industry around the location in
this photograph, will find in it an added fascination.[Illustration: "TUNING UP"--A DAILY DRILL IN THE CAPTURED FORT

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here Sherman's men are seen at daily drill in Atlanta.This photograph has
an interest beyond most war pictures, for it gives a clear idea of the
soldierly bearing of the men that were to march to the sea.There was an
easy carelessness in their appearance copied from their great commander,
but they were never allowed to become slouchy.Sherman was the antithesis
of a martinet, but he had, in the Atlanta campaign, molded his army into
the "mobile machine" that he desired it to be, and he was anxious to keep
the men up to this high pitch of efficiency for the performance of still
greater deeds.No better disciplined army existed in the world at the time
Sherman's "<DW15>s" set out for the sea.[Illustration: CUTTING LOOSE FROM THE BASE, NOVEMBER 12th

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB."On the 12th of November the railroad and telegraph communications with
the rear were broken and the army stood detached from all friends,
dependent on its own resources and supplies," writes Sherman.Meanwhile
all detachments were marching rapidly to Atlanta with orders to break up
the railroad en route and "generally to so damage the country as to make
it untenable to the enemy."Sherman, in
a home letter written from Grand Gulf, Mississippi, May 6, 1863, stated
clearly his views regarding the destruction of property.Speaking of the
wanton havoc wrought on a fine plantation in the path of the army, he
added: "It is done, of course, by the accursed stragglers who won't fight
but hang behind and disgrace our cause and country.Bowie had fled,
leaving everything on the approach of our troops.Of course, devastation
marked the whole path of the army, and I know all the principal officers
detest the infamous practice as much as I do.Of course, I expect and do
take corn, bacon, ham, mules, and everything to support an army, and don't
object much to the using of fences for firewood, but this universal
burning and wanton destruction of private property is not justified in
war."[Illustration: THE BUSTLE OF DEPARTURE FROM ATLANTA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Sherman's men worked like beavers during their last few days in Atlanta.There was no time to be lost; the army was gotten under way with that
precision which marked all Sherman's movements.In the upper picture,
finishing touches are being put to the railroad, and in the lower is seen
the short work that was made of such public buildings as might be of the
slightest use in case the Confederates should recapture the town.As far
back as Chattanooga, while plans for the Atlanta campaign were being
formed, Sherman had been revolving a subsequent march to the sea in case
he was successful.He had not then made up his mind whether it should be
in the direction of Mobile or Savannah, but his Meridian campaign, in
Mississippi, had convinced him that the march was entirely feasible, and
gradually he worked out in his mind its masterly details.At seven in the
morning on November 16th, Sherman rode out along the Decatur road, passed
his marching troops, and near the spot where his beloved McPherson had
fallen, paused for a last look at the city."Behind us," he says, "lay
Atlanta, smouldering and in ruins, the black smoke rising high in air and
hanging like a pall over the ruined city."All about could be seen the
glistening gun-barrels and white-topped wagons, "and the men marching
steadily and rapidly with a cheery look and swinging pace."Some
regimental band struck up "John Brown," and the thousands of voices of the
vast army joined with a mighty chorus in song.A feeling of exhilaration
pervaded the troops.This marching into the unknown held for them the
allurement of adventure, as none but Sherman knew their destination.But
as he worked his way past them on the road, many a group called out,
"Uncle Billy, I guess Grant is waiting for us at Richmond."The
devil-may-care spirit of the troops brought to Sherman's mind grave
thoughts of his own responsibility.He knew that success would be regarded
as a matter of course, but should he fail the march would be set down as
"the wild adventure of a crazy fool."He had no intention of marching
directly to Richmond, but from the first his objective was the seacoast,
at Savannah or Port Royal, or even Pensacola, Florida.[Illustration: RUINS IN ATLANTA]


[Illustration: THE GUNS THAT SHERMAN TOOK ALONG

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]In Hood's hasty evacuation of Atlanta many of his guns were left behind.These 12-pounder Napoleon bronze field-pieces have been gathered by the
Federals from the abandoned fortifications, which had been equipped
entirely with field artillery, such as these.It was an extremely useful
capture for Sherman's army, whose supply of artillery had been somewhat
limited during the siege, and still further reduced by the necessity to
fortify Atlanta.On the march to the sea Sherman took with him only
sixty-five field-pieces.The <DW64> refugees in the lower picture recall an
embarrassment of the march to the sea."<DW64>s of all sizes" flocked in
the army's path and stayed there, a picturesque procession, holding
tightly to the skirts of the army which they believed had come for the
sole purpose of setting them free.The cavalcade of <DW64>s soon became so
numerous that Sherman became anxious for his army's sustenance, and
finding an old gray-haired black at Covington, Sherman explained to him
carefully that if the <DW64>s continued to swarm after the army it would
fail in its purpose and they would not get their freedom.Sherman believed
that the old man spread this news to the slaves along the line of march,
and in part saved the army from being overwhelmed by the contrabands.[Illustration: <DW64>s FLOCKING IN THE ARMY'S PATH

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: THE DEFENDER OF SAVANNAH]

The task of General Hardee in defending Savannah was one of peculiar
difficulty.He had only eighteen thousand men, and he was uncertain where
Sherman would strike.Some supposed that Sherman would move at once upon
Charleston, but Hardee argued that the Union army would have to establish
a new base of supplies on the seacoast before attempting to cross the
numerous deep rivers and swamps of South Carolina.Hardee's task therefore
was to hold Savannah just as long as possible, and then to withdraw
northward to unite with the troops which General Bragg was assembling, and
with the detachments scattered at this time over the Carolinas.In
protecting his position around Savannah, Fort McAllister was of prime
importance, since it commanded the Great Ogeechee River in such a way as
to prevent the approach of the Federal fleet, Sherman's dependence for
supplies.It was accordingly manned by a force of two hundred under
command of Major G. W. Anderson, provided with fifty days' rations for use
in case the work became isolated.About
noon of December 13th, Major Anderson's men saw troops in blue moving
about in the woods.The artillery on the land side
of the fort was turned upon them as they advanced from one position to
another, and sharpshooters picked off some of their officers.At half-past
four o'clock, however, the long-expected charge was made from three
different directions, so that the defenders, too few in number to hold the
whole line, were soon overpowered.Hardee now had to consider more
narrowly the best time for withdrawing from the lines at Savannah.[Illustration: FORT McALLISTER--THE LAST BARRIER TO THE SEA

COPYRIGHT, 1911 PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: WATERFRONT AT SAVANNAH, 1865

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Savannah was better protected by nature from attack by land or water than
any other city near the Atlantic seaboard.Stretching to the north, east,
and southward lay swamps and morasses through which ran the river-approach
of twelve miles to the town.Innumerable small creeks separated the
marshes into islands over which it was out of the question for an army to
march without first building roads and bridging miles of waterways.The
Federal fleet had for months been on the blockade off the mouth of the
river, and Savannah had been closed to blockade runners since the fall of
Fort Pulaski in April, 1862.But obstructions and powerful batteries held
the river, and Fort McAllister, ten miles to the south, on the Ogeechee,
still held the city safe in its guardianship.[Illustration: FORT McALLISTER, THAT HELD THE FLEET AT BAY

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: THE FIFTEEN MINUTES' FIGHT

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Across these ditches at Fort McAllister, through entangling abatis, over
palisading, the Federals had to fight every inch of their way against the
Confederate garrison up to the very doors of their bomb-proofs, before the
defenders yielded on December 13th.Sherman had at once perceived that the
position could be carried only by a land assault.The fort was strongly
protected by ditches, palisades, and plentiful abatis; marshes and streams
covered its flanks, but Sherman's troops knew that shoes and clothing and
abundant rations were waiting for them just beyond it, and had any of them
been asked if they could take the fort their reply would have been in the
words of the poem: "Ain't we simply got to take it?"Sherman selected for
the honor of the assault General Hazen's second division of the Fifteenth
Corps, the same which he himself had commanded at Shiloh and Vicksburg.Gaily the troops crossed the bridge on the morning of the 13th.Sherman
was watching anxiously through his glass late in the afternoon when a
Federal steamer came up the river and signaled the query: "Is Fort
McAllister taken?"To which Sherman sent reply: "Not yet, but it will be
in a minute."At that instant Sherman saw Hazen's troops emerge from the
woods before the fort, "the lines dressed as on parade, with colors
flying."Immediately dense clouds of smoke belching from the fort
enveloped the Federals.There was a pause; the smoke cleared away, and,
says Sherman, "the parapets were blue with our men."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: A BIG GUN AT FORT McALLISTER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Fort McAllister is at last in complete possession of the Federals, and a
group of the men who had charged over these ramparts has arranged itself
before the camera as if in the very act of firing the great gun that
points seaward across the marshes, toward Ossabaw Sound.There is one very
peculiar thing proved by this photograph--the gun itself is almost in a
fixed position as regards range and sweep of fire.Instead of the
elevating screw to raise or depress the muzzle, there has been substituted
a block of wood wedged with a heavy spike, and the narrow pit in which the
gun carriage is sunk admits of it being turned but a foot or so to right
or left.It evidently controlled one critical point in the river, but
could not have been used in lending any aid to the repelling of General
Hazen's attack.The officer pointing with outstretched arm is indicating
the very spot at which a shell fired from his gun would fall.The men in
the trench are artillerymen of General Hazen's division of the Fifteenth
Corps; their appearance in their fine uniforms, polished breastplates and
buttons, proves that Sherman's men could not have presented the ragged
appearance that they are often pictured as doing in the war-time sketches.That Army and Navy have come together is proved also by the figure of a
marine from the fleet, who is standing at "Attention" just above the
breach of the gun.Next, leaning on his saber, is a cavalryman, in short
jacket and chin-strap.[Illustration: THE SPOILS OF VICTORY]

THE TROOPS THAT MARCHED TO THE SEA BECOME DAY-LABORERS

Here are the men that marched to the sea doing their turn as day-laborers,
gleefully trundling their wheelbarrows, gathering up everything of value
in Fort McAllister to swell the size of Sherman's "Christmas present."Brigadier-General W. B. Hazen, after his men had successfully stormed the
stubbornly defended fort, reported the capture of twenty-four pieces of
ordnance, with their equipment, forty tons of ammunition, a month's supply
of food for the garrison, and the small arms of the command.In the upper
picture the army engineers are busily at work removing a great 48-pounder
8-inch Columbiad that had so long repelled the Federal fleet.There is
always work enough and to spare for the engineers both before and after
the capture of a fortified position.In the wheelbarrows is a harvest of
shells and torpedoes.These deadly instruments of destruction had been
relied upon by the Confederates to protect the land approach to Fort
McAllister, which was much less strongly defensible on that side than at
the waterfront.While Sherman's army was approaching Savannah one of his
officers had his leg blown off by a torpedo buried in the road and stepped
on by his horse.After that Sherman set a line of Confederate prisoners
across the road to march ahead of the army, and no more torpedoes were
found.After the capture of Fort McAllister the troops set to work
gingerly scraping about wherever the ground seemed to have been disturbed,
trying to find and remove the dangerous hidden menaces to life.At last
the ground was rendered safe and the troops settled down to the occupation
of Fort McAllister where the bravely fighting little Confederate garrison
had held the key to Savannah.The city was the first to fall of the
Confederacy's Atlantic seaports, now almost locked from the outside world
by the blockade.By the capture of Fort McAllister, which crowned the
march to the sea, Sherman had numbered the days of the war.The fall of
the remaining ports was to follow in quick succession, and by Washington's
Birthday, 1865, the entire coast-line was to be in possession of the
Federals.[Illustration: SHERMAN'S TROOPS DISMANTLING FORT McALLISTER]

Durham's Station, N. C., were begun the negotiations between Johnston and
Sherman which finally led to that event.The two generals met there on
April 17th; it was a highly dramatic moment, for Sherman had in his pocket
the cipher message just received telling of the assassination of Lincoln.[Illustration: THE END OF THE MARCH--BENNETT'S FARMHOUSE

and hastily pressed into service by the Federal navy to help solve the
problem of patrolling the three thousand miles of coast, along which the
blockade must be made effective.In order to penetrate the intricate
inlets and rivers, light-draft fighting-vessels were required, and the
most immediate means of securing these was to purchase every sort of
merchant craft that could possibly be adapted to the purposes of war,
either as a fighting-vessel or as a transport.The ferryboat in the
picture has been provided with guns and her pilot-houses armored.A
casemate of iron plates has been provided for the gunners.The Navy
Department purchased and equipped in all one hundred and thirty-six
vessels in 1861, and by the end of the year had increased the number of
seamen in the service from 7,600 to over 22,000.Many of these new
recruits saw their first active service aboard the converted ferryboats,
tugboats, and other frail and unfamiliar vessels making up the nondescript
fleet that undertook to cut off the commerce of the South.The experience
thus gained under very unusual circumstances placed them of necessity
among the bravest sailors of the navy.[Illustration: THE LAST PORT CLOSED

catch a blockade-runner, and as the Federal navy captured ship after ship
of this character they began to acquire a numerous fleet of swift steamers
from which it was difficult for any vessel to get away.The "Vance"
brought many a cargo to the hungry Southern ports, slipping safely by the
blockading fleet and back again till her shrewd Captain Willie felt that
he could give the slip to anything afloat.On her last trip she had safely
gotten by the Federal vessels lying off the harbor of Wilmington, North
Carolina, and was dancing gleefully on her way with a bountiful cargo of
cotton and turpentine when, on September 10, 1864, in latitude 34 deg.W., a vessel was sighted which rapidly bore down upon
her.It proved to be the "Santiago de Cuba," Captain O. S. Glisson.The
rapidity with which the approaching vessel overhauled him was enough to
convince Captain Willie that she was in his own class.The "Santiago de
Cuba" carried eleven guns, and the "Vance" humbly hove to, to receive the
prize-crew which took her to Boston, where she was condemned.In the
picture we see her lying high out of the water, her valuable cargo having
been removed and sold to enrich by prize-money the officers and men of her
fleet captor.[Illustration: A GREYHOUND CAUGHT--WRECK OF THE BLOCKADE-RUNNER "COLT"]

The wreck of this blockade-runner, the "Colt," lies off Sullivan's Island,
Charleston Harbor, in 1865.The coast of the Carolinas, before the war was
over, was strewn with just such sights as this.The bones of former
"greyhounds" became landmarks by which the still uncaptured
blockade-runners could get their bearings and lay a course to safety.If
one of these vessels were cut off from making port and surrounded by
Federal pursuers, the next best thing was to run her ashore in shallow
water, where the gunboats could not follow and where her valuable cargo
could be secured by the Confederates.A single cargo at war-time prices
was enough to pay more than the cost of the vessel.Regular auctions were
held in Charleston or Wilmington, where prices for goods not needed by the
Confederate Government were run up to fabulous figures.The business of
blockade-running was well organized abroad, especially in England.One
successful trip was enough to start the enterprise with a handsome profit.A blockade-runner like the "Kate," which made forty trips or more, would
enrich her owners almost beyond the dreams of avarice.[Illustration: THE CONFEDERATE RAM "STONEWALL"]

Here are two striking views in the Port Royal dry-dock of the Confederate
ram "Stonewall."When this powerful fighting-ship sailed from Copenhagen,
Jan.T. J. Page, C. S. N., the Federal
navy became confronted by its most formidable antagonist during the war.In March, 1863, the Confederacy had negotiated a loan of L3,000,000, and
being thus at last in possession of the necessary funds, Captain Bulloch
and Mr.Slidell arranged with M. Arman, who was a member of the
_Corps-Legislatif_ and proprietor of a large shipyard at Bordeaux, for the
construction of ironclad ships of war.Slidell had already received
assurances from persons in the confidence of Napoleon III that the
building of the ships in the French yards would not be interfered with,
and that getting them to sea would be connived at by the Government.Owing
to the indubitable proof laid before the Emperor by the Federal diplomats
at Paris, he was compelled to revoke the guarantee that had been given to
Slidell and Bulloch.A plan was arranged, however, by which M. Arman
should sell the vessels to various European powers; and he disposed of the
ironclad ram "Sphinx" to the Danish Government, then at war with Prussia.Delivery of the ship at Copenhagen was not made, however, till after the
war had ceased, and no trouble was experienced by the Confederates in
arranging for the purchase of the vessel.On January 24, 1865, she
rendezvoused off Quiberon, on the French coast; the remainder of her
officers, crew, and supplies were put aboard of her; the Confederate flag
was hoisted over her, and she was christened the "Stonewall."Already the
vessel was discovered to have sprung a leak, and Captain Page ran into
Ferrol, Spain.Here dock-yard facilities were at first granted, but were
withdrawn at the protest of the American Minister.While Captain Page was
repairing his vessel as best he could, the "Niagara" and the "Sacramento"
appeared, and after some weeks the "Stonewall" offered battle in vain.[Illustration]

THE LAST INVASION OF TENNESSEE--FRANKLIN--NASHVILLE


In the latter days of September, 1864, the Confederate Army of Tennessee
lay in the vicinity of Macon, Georgia.It was a dispirited body of men,
homesick and discouraged.For four long months, first under one leader and
then under another, it had opposed, step by step, Sherman's advance toward
Atlanta, and now that important strategic point was in the hands of the
Federal forces.About the middle of July the President of the Confederacy
had seen fit to remove Joseph E. Johnston from the command and replace him
with John B. Hood.The latter's habit of mind and methods of action led
the Richmond authorities to believe that he would proceed very differently
from Johnston, and in this he did not disappoint them.The results showed
that Johnston's Fabian policy was by far the better one under the
circumstances.Sherman had the stronger army, but he was compelled
constantly to detach portions of it in order to guard his lengthening line
of supplies.The one thing he desired most was that his opponent should
assume an aggressive attitude.Hood's idea was precipitation rather than
patience, and in consequence on the 2d of September General Slocum entered
the coveted city.On the 22d of that month President Davis visited the Southern Army, and
made a memorable address to the troops.He promised them--and they were
delighted at the news--that they would soon be back in Tennessee, for a
fresh invasion of that State had been planned.This would, declared the
speaker, place Sherman in a worse predicament than that in which Napoleon
found himself at Moscow.But the Federal general had at least the
advantage of learning what was going to happen to him, for the President's
words were reported verbatim in the Southern papers, and he prepared to
meet his antagonists.Thomas, with the Army of the Cumberland, was sent to
Nashville while Schofield, with his smaller force known as the Army of the
Ohio, returned to Knoxville where he had spent the previous winter, to
await Hood's advance.By the 1st of October the latter was across the
Chattahoochee in the hope of drawing Sherman from Atlanta.There was a
brave fight at Allatoona where General Corse "held the fort," but Sherman,
although he followed the Confederate army, was unable to bring on a
general engagement.His great plan of a march through Georgia to the sea was now fully formed
in his mind.He had not yet obtained Grant's sanction to the scheme, but
he ordered Schofield to cooperate with Thomas and sent the Fourth Corps as
further assistance.He himself ceased the pursuit of Hood at Gaylesville
and turned back to Atlanta, confident that the fate of Tennessee was safe
in the hands of his ablest lieutenant, George H. Thomas.Hood appeared on
the 26th of October at Decatur on the south bank of the Tennessee River.Lack of supplies had delayed his advance, but even so his performances had
greatly alarmed the North.Twice had he interposed between Sherman and the
Federal base and had destroyed many miles of railway, but what in other
circumstances would have placed the Union leader in a dangerous
predicament was now of little moment, since the latter was rapidly making
preparations to cut himself off from all communication with the source of
his supplies.It was necessary that Hood should have the assistance of
Forrest, whose dauntless cavalry had been playing great havoc with the
Federal stores in western Tennessee, so he moved to Florence before
crossing the river, and here Forrest joined him on November 14th.In the
meantime, Schofield, with about twenty-eight thousand men, had reached
Pulaski on the way to encounter the Southern advance.Now began a series of brilliant strategic moves, kept up for a fortnight
before the two small armies--they were of almost equal strength met in
one awful clash.Hood's efforts were bent toward cutting Schofield off
from Thomas at Nashville.There was a mad race for the Duck River, and the
Federals got over at Columbia in the very nick of time.The Southern
leader, by a skilful piece of strategy and a forced march, pushed on to
Spring Hill ahead of his opponent.He was in an excellent position to
annihilate General Stanley who was in advance, and then crush the
remainder of the Federals who were moving with the slow wagon-trains.But
owing to a number of strange mishaps, which brought forth much
recrimination but no satisfactory explanation, the Union army slipped by
with little damage and entrenched itself at Franklin on the Harpeth River.Of all the dark days of Confederate history--and they were many--the 29th
of November, 1864, has been mourned as that of "lost opportunities."Schofield did not expect, or desire, a battle at Franklin, but he was
treated to one the following afternoon when the Confederates came up, and
it was of the most severe nature.The first attack was made as the light
began to wane, and the Federal troops stood their ground although the
orders had been to withdraw, because through some blunder two brigades in
blue had been stationed, unsupported, directly in front of Hood's
approach.The stubborn resistance of Schofield's army only increased the
ardor of the opponents.It is said that thirteen separate assaults were
made upon the Union entrenchments, and the fearful carnage was finally
carried into the streets and among the dooryards of the little town.At
nine o'clock the fury of the iron storm was quelled.Five Confederate
generals, including the gallant Cleburne, lay dead upon the field.In two
of the Southern brigades all the general officers were either killed or
wounded.Hood's loss was about sixty-three hundred, nearly three times
that of Schofield.By midnight the latter was on his way, uninterrupted,
to Nashville.Meanwhile Thomas was performing a herculean task within the
fortifications of that capital city.He had received a large number of
raw recruits and a motley collection of troops from garrisons in the West.These had to be drilled into an efficient army, and not one move to fight
would Thomas make until this had been done.Grant, in Virginia, grew
impatient and the Northern papers clamored for an attack on Hood, who had
now arrived with thirty-eight thousand men before the city.Finally Grant
took action, and General Logan was hurrying to assume the Federal command.But by the time he reached Louisville there was no need for his services.Thomas had for some days been ready with his force of forty-five thousand,
but to increase the difficulties of his position, a severe storm of
freezing rain made action impossible until the morning of December 15th.The Union lines of defense were in a semi-circle and Hood was on the
southeast, lightly entrenched.The first assault on his right wing
followed by one on his left, forced the Confederates back to a second
position two miles to the south, and that was the first day's work.Hood
had detached a part of his forces and he did all he could to gain time
until he might recover his full strength.But he had respite only until
Thomas was ready on the morrow, which was about noon.The Union army
deployed in front of the Southerners and overlapped their left wing.An
attack on the front was bravely met and repulsed by the Confederates, and
the Federal leader, extending his right, compelled his opponent to stretch
his own lines more and more.Finally they broke just to the left of the
center, and a general forward movement on the Union side ended in the
utter rout of the splendid and courageous Army of Tennessee.It melted away in disorder; the pursuit was vigorous, and only a small
portion reassembled at Columbia and fell back with a poor show of order
behind the Tennessee.Many military historians have seen in the battle of Nashville the most
crushing defeat of the war.Certainly no other brought such complete ruin
upon a large and well-organized body of troops.[Illustration: RUSHING A FEDERAL BATTERY OUT OF JOHNSONVILLE

he ordered the garrison at Johnsonville, on the Tennessee, eighty miles

garrison at this same Johnsonville that, a month earlier, had been
frightened into panic and flight when the bold Confederate raider,
Forrest, appeared on the west bank of the river and began a noisy
cannonade.The day after the photograph was taken (November 23d) the
encampment in the picture was broken.[Illustration: FORT NEGLEY, LOOKING TOWARD THE CONFEDERATE CENTER AND

THE SIEGE AND FALL OF PETERSBURG

    It is not improbable that Grant might have made more headway by
    leaving a sufficient part of his army in the trenches in front of
    Petersburg and by moving with a heavy force far to the west upon Lee's
    communications; or, if it were determined to capture the place _a main
    forte_, by making a massed attack upon some point in the center after
    suitable mining operations had weakened Lee's defenses and prepared
    for such an operation.But the end was to come with opening spring.To
    the far-sighted, this was no longer doubtful.The South must succumb
    to the greater material resources of the North, despite its courage
    and its sacrifices.--_Colonel T. A. Dodge, U. S. A., in "A Bird's-Eye
    View of Our Civil War."_


During the winter of 1864-65, General Lee, fighting Grant without, was
fighting famine within.The shivering, half-clad soldiers of the South
crouched over feeble fires in their entrenchments.The men were exposed to
the rain, snow, and sleet; sickness and disease soon added their horrors
to the desolation.The
life of the Confederacy was ebbing fast.Behind Union breastworks, early in 1865, General Grant was making
preparations for the opening of a determined campaign with the coming of
spring.Mile after mile had been added to his entrenchments, and they now
extended to Hatcher's Run on the left.The Confederate lines had been
stretched until they were so thin that there was constant danger of
breaking.A. P. Hill was posted on the right; Gordon and Anderson held the
center, and Longstreet was on the left.Union troops were mobilizing in
front of Petersburg.By February 1st, Sherman was fairly off from Savannah
on his northward march to join Grant.He was weak in cavalry and Grant
determined to bring Sheridan from the Shenandoah, whence the bulk of
Early's forces had been withdrawn, and send him to assist Sherman.Sheridan left Winchester February 27th, wreaking much destruction as he
advanced, but circumstances compelled him to seek a new base at White
House.On March 27th he formed a junction with the armies of the Potomac
and the James.Such were the happenings that prompted Lee to prepare for
the evacuation of Petersburg.And he might be able, in his rapid marches,
to outdistance Grant, join his forces with those of Johnston, fall on
Sherman, destroy one wing of the Union army and arouse the hopes of his
soldiers, and prolong the life of his Government.General Grant knew the condition of Lee's army and, with the unerring
instinct of a military leader, surmised what the plan of the Southern
general must be.He decided to move on the left, destroy both the Danville
and South Side railroads, and put his army in better condition to pursue.General Lee, in order to get Grant to look another way for a while,
decided to attack Grant's line on the right, and gain some of the works.This would compel Grant to draw some of his force from his left and secure
a way of escape to the west.This bold plan was left for execution to the
gallant Georgian, General John B. Gordon, who had successfully led the
reverse attack at Cedar Creek, in the Shenandoah, in October, 1864.Near
the crater stood Fort Stedman.Between it and the Confederate front, a
distance of about one hundred and fifty yards, was a strip of firm earth,
in full view of both picket lines.Across this space some deserters had
passed to the Union entrenchments.General Gordon took advantage of this
fact and accordingly selected his men, who, at the sound of the signal
gun, should disarm the Federal pickets, while fifty more men were to cross
the open space quickly with axes and cut away the abatis, and three
hundred others were to rush through the opening, and capture the fort and
guns.At four o'clock on the morning of March 25, 1865, Gordon had everything in
readiness.His chosen band wore white strips of cloth across the breast,
that they might distinguish each other in the hand-to-hand fight that
would doubtless ensue.Behind these men half of Lee's army was massed to
support the attack.In the silence of the early morning, a gunshot rang
out from the Confederate works.Not a Federal picket-shot was heard.The
axemen rushed across the open and soon the thuds of their axes told of the
cutting away of the abatis.The three hundred surged through the entrance,
overpowered the gunners, captured batteries to the right and to the left,
and were in control of the situation.Gordon's corps of about five
thousand was on hand to sustain the attack but the remaining reserves,
through failure of the guides, did not come, and the general found himself
cut off with a rapidly increasing army surrounding him.Fort Haskell, on the left, began to throw its shells.Under its cover,
heavy columns of Federals sent by General Parke, now commanding the Ninth
Corps, pressed forward.The Confederates resisted the charge, and from the
captured Fort Stedman and the adjoining batteries poured volley after
volley on Willcox's advancing lines of blue.The Northerners fell back,
only to re-form and renew the attack.This time they secured a footing,
and for twenty minutes the fighting was terrific.Then across the brow of the hill swept the command of Hartranft.The furious musketry, and
artillery directed by General Tidball, shrivelled up the ranks of Gordon
until they fled from the fort and its neighboring batteries in the midst
of withering fire, and those who did not were captured.This was the last
aggressive effort of the expiring Confederacy in front of Petersburg, and
it cost three thousand men.The affair at Fort Stedman did not turn Grant from his plans against the
Confederate right.With the railroads here destroyed, Richmond would be
completely cut off.On the morning of the 29th, as previously arranged,
the movement began.Sheridan swept to the south with his cavalry, as if he
were to fall upon the railroads.General Warren, with fifteen thousand
men, was working his way through the tangled woods and low swamps in the
direction of Lee's right.At the same time, Lee stripped his entrenchments
at Petersburg as much as he dared and hurried General Anderson, with
infantry, and Fitzhugh Lee, with cavalry, forward to hold the roads over
which he hoped to escape.On Friday morning, March 31st, the opposing
forces, the Confederates much reenforced, found themselves at Dinwiddie
Court House.The woods and swamps prevented the formation of a regular
line of battle.Lee made his accustomed flank movement, with heavy loss to
the Federals as they tried to move in the swampy forests.The Northerners
finally were ready to advance when it was found that Lee had fallen back.During the day and night, reenforcements were coming in from all sides.The Confederates had taken their position at Five Forks.Early the next afternoon, the 1st of April, Sheridan, reenforced by
Warren, was arranging his troops for battle.The day was nearly spent when
all was in readiness.The sun was not more than two hours high when the
Northern army moved toward that of the South, defended by a breastwork
behind a dense undergrowth of pines.Through this mass of timber the
Federals crept with bayonets fixed.They charged upon the Confederates,
but, at the same time, a galling fire poured into them from the left,
spreading dismay and destruction in their midst.The intrepid Sheridan
urged his black battle-charger, the famous Rienzi, now known as
Winchester, up and down the lines, cheering his men on in the fight.He
seemed to be everywhere at once.The Confederate left was streaming down
the White Oak Road.But General Crawford had reached a cross-road, by
taking a circuitous route, and the Southern army was thus shut off from
retreat.The Federal cavalry had dismounted and was doing its full share
of work.The Confederates soon found themselves trapped, and the part of
their army in action that day was nearly annihilated.With night came the news of the crushing blow to Lee.General Grant was
seated by his camp-fire surrounded by his staff, when a courier dashed
into his presence with the message of victory.Soon from every great gun
along the Union line belched forth the sheets of flame.The earth shook
with the awful cannonade.Mortar shells made huge parabolas through the
air.The Union batteries crept closer and closer to the Confederate lines
and the balls crashed into the streets of the doomed city.At dawn of the 2nd of April the grand assault began.The Federal troops
sprang forward with a rush.Despite the storms of grape and canister, the
Sixth Corps plunged through the battery smoke, and across the walls,
pushing the brave defenders to the inner works.The whole corps penetrated
the lines and swept everything before it toward Hatcher's Run.Some of the
troops even reached the South Side Railroad, where the brave General A. P.
Hill fell mortally wounded.Everywhere, the blue masses poured into the works.General Ord, on the
right of the Sixth Corps, helped to shut the Confederate right into the
city.General Parke, with the Ninth Corps, carried the main line.The thin
gray line could no longer stem the tide that was engulfing it.The
Confederate troops south of Hatcher's Run fled to the west, and fought
General Miles until General Sheridan and a division from Meade appeared on
the scene.By noon the Federals held the line of the outer works from Fort
Gregg to the Appomattox.The last stronghold carried was Fort Gregg, at
which the men of Gibbon's corps had one of the most desperate struggles of
the war.The Confederates now fell back to the inner fortifications and
the siege of Petersburg came to an end.[Illustration: A BATTERED RELIC OF COLONIAL DAYS IN PETERSBURG

magnificence.The havoc wrought upon the dwellings of the town was heavy;
certain localities suffered more than others, and those residents who
seemed to dwell in the safest zones had been ever ready to open their
houses to the sick and wounded of Lee's army.As Grant's troops marched
in, many pale faces gazed out at them from the windows, and at the
doorsteps stood men whose wounds exempted them from ever bearing arms
again.[Illustration: THE SHATTERED DOORWAY

were continual occurrences after dark.In stealthy sorties one side or the

near Elliott's salient and show how effectually it was protected from any
attempt to storm the works by rushing tactics on the part of the Federal
infantry.Not far from here lies the excavation of the Crater.[Illustration: GENERAL JOHN B. GORDON, C. S.To this gallant young Georgia officer, just turned thirty-three at the
time, Lee entrusted the last desperate effort to break through the
tightening Federal lines, March 25, 1865.Lee was confronted by the
dilemma of either being starved out of Petersburg and Richmond, or of
getting out himself and uniting his army to that of Johnston in North
Carolina to crush Sherman before Grant could reach him.Gordon was to
begin this latter, almost impossible, task by an attack on Fort Stedman,
which the Confederates believed to be the weakest point in the Federal
fortifications.The position had been captured from them in the beginning,
and they knew that the nature of the ground and its nearness to their own
lines had made it difficult to strengthen it very much.It was planned to
surprise the fort before daylight.Below are seen the rabbit-like burrows
of Gracie's Salient, past which Gordon led his famished men.When the
order came to go forward, they did not flinch, but hurled themselves
bravely against fortifications far stronger than their own.Three columns
of a hundred picked men each moved down the <DW72> shown on the left and
advanced in the darkness against Stedman.They were to be followed by a
division.Through the gap which the storming parties were expected to open
in the Federal lines, Gordon's columns would rush in both directions and a
cavalry force was to sweep on and destroy the pontoon bridges across the
Appomattox and to raid City Point, breaking up the Federal base.It was no
light task, for although Fort Stedman itself was weak, it was flanked by
Battery No.An
attacking party on the right would be exposed to an enfilading fire in
crossing the plain; while on the left the approach was difficult be cause
of ravines, one of which the Confederate engineers had turned into a pond
by damming a creek.All night long General Gordon's wife, with the brave
women of Petersburg, sat up tearing strips of white cloth, to be tied on
the arms of the men in the storming parties so that they could tell friend
from foe in the darkness and confusion of the assault.Before the
sleep-dazed Federals could offer effective resistance, Gordon's men had
possession of the fort and the batteries.Only after one of the severest
engagements of the siege were the Confederates driven back.[Illustration: GRACIE'S SALIENT--AFTER GORDON'S FORLORN HOPE HAD CHARGED]


APRIL SECOND--"THIS IS A SAD BUSINESS"

As his general watched, this boy fought to stem the Federal rush--but
fell, his breast pierced by a bayonet, in the trenches of Fort Mahone.It
is heart-rending to look at a picture such as this; it is sad to think of
it and to write about it.Here is a boy of only fourteen years, his face
innocent of a razor, his feet unshod and stockingless in the bitter April
weather.It is to be hoped that the man who slew him has forgotten it, for
this face would haunt him surely.Many who fought in the blue ranks were
young, but in the South there were whole companies made up of such boys as
this.At the battle of Newmarket the scholars of the Virgina Military
Institute, the eldest seventeen and the youngest twelve, marched from the
classrooms under arms, joined the forces of General Breckinridge, and
aided by their historic charge to gain a brilliant victory over the
Federal General Sigel.The never-give-in spirit was implanted in the youth
of the Confederacy, as well as in the hearts of the grizzled veterans.Lee
had inspired them, but in addition to this inspiration, as General Gordon
writes, "every man of them was supported by their extraordinary
consecration, resulting from the conviction that he was fighting in the
defense of home and the rights of his State.Hence their unfaltering faith
in the justice of the cause, their fortitude in the extremest privations,
their readiness to stand shoeless and shivering in the trenches at night
and to face any danger at their leader's call."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.APPOMATTOX

    I now come to what I have always regarded--shall ever regard--as the
    most creditable episode in all American history--an episode without a
    blemish, imposing, dignified, simple, heroic.Two men met that day, representative of American civilization, the
    whole world looking on.The two were Grant and Lee--types each.Both
    rose, and rose unconsciously, to the full height of the occasion--and
    than that occasion there has been none greater.About it, and them,
    there was no theatrical display, no self-consciousness, no effort at
    effect.A great crisis was to be met; and they met that crisis as
    great countrymen should.Consider the possibilities; think for a
    moment of what that day might have been; you will then see cause to
    thank God for much.--_General Charles Francis Adams, U. S. V., in Phi
    Beta Kappa Address delivered at the University of Chicago, June 17,
    1902._


We are now to witness the closing scene of one of the greatest tragedies
ever enacted on the world's stage.Many and varied had been the scenes
during the war; the actors and their parts had been real.The wounds of
the South were bleeding; the North was awaiting the decisive blow.Fortunes, great and small, had melted away
by the hundreds of millions.In Richmond, the citadel of the waning
Confederacy, the people were starving.The Southern army, half clad and
without food, was but a shadow of its once proud self.Bravely and long
the men in gray had followed their adored leader.Now the limit of
endurance had been reached.It was the second day of April, 1865.Lee realized that after Petersburg
his beloved Richmond must fall.The order was given for the movement to
begin at eight o'clock that night.The darkness of the early morning of
the 3d was suddenly transformed into a lurid light overcasting the
heavens for miles around the famous city whose name had became a
household word over the civilized world.The
capital of the Confederacy, the pride of the South, toward which the Army
of the Potomac had fought its way, leaving a trail of blood for four weary
years, had at last succumbed to the overwhelming power of Grant's
indomitable armies.President Davis had received a despatch while attending services at St.Paul's church, Sunday morning, the 2d, advising him that the city must be
evacuated that night, and, leaving the church at once, he hastened the
preparations for flight with his personal papers and the archives of the
Confederate Government.During that Sabbath day and night Richmond was in
a state of riot.There had been an unwarranted feeling of security in the
city, and the unwelcome news, spreading like an electric flash, was
paralyzing and disastrous in its effect.Prisoners were released from
their toils, a lawless mob overran the thoroughfares, and civic government
was nullified.One explosion after another, on the morning of the 3d, rent
the air with deafening roar, as the magazines took fire.The scene was one
of terror and grandeur.The flames spread to the city from the ships, bridges, and arsenal, which
had been set on fire, and hundreds of buildings, including the best
residential section of the capital of the Confederacy, were destroyed.When the Union army entered the city in the morning, thousands of the
inhabitants, men, women, and children, were gathered at street corners and
in the parks, in wildest confusion.The commissary depot had been broken
open by the starving mob, and rifled of its contents, until the place was
reached by the spreading flames.The Federal soldiers stacked arms, and
heroically battled with the fire, drafting into the work all able-bodied
men found in the city.The invaders extinguished the flames, and soon
restored the city to a state of order and safety.The invalid wife of
General Lee, who was exposed to danger, was furnished with an ambulance
and corporal's guard until the danger was past.President Lincoln, who had visited Grant at Petersburg, entered Richmond
on the 4th of April.He visited President Davis' house, and Libby Prison,
then deserted, and held a conference with prominent citizens and army
officers of the Confederacy.The President seemed deeply concerned and
weighted down with the realization of the great responsibilities that
would fall upon him after the war.Only ten days later the nation was
shaken from ocean to ocean by the tragic news of his assassination.General Lee had started on his last march by eight o'clock on the night of
the 2d.By midnight the evacuation of both Petersburg and Richmond was
completed.For nine months the invincible forces of Lee had kept a foe of
more than twice their numerical strength from invading their stronghold,
and only after a long and harassing siege were they forced to retreat.They saw the burning city as their line of march was illuminated by the
conflagration, and emotions too deep for words overcame them.The woods
and fields, in their fresh, bright colors of spring, were in sharp
contrast to the travel-worn, weather-beaten, ragged veterans passing over
the verdant plain.Lee hastened the march of his troops to Amelia Court
House, where he had ordered supplies, but by mistake the train of supplies
had been sent on to Richmond.This was a crushing blow to the hungry men,
who had been stimulated on their tiresome march by the anticipation of
much-needed food.The fatality of war was now hovering over them like a
huge black specter.General Grant did not proceed to Richmond, but leaving General Weitzel to
invest the city, he hastened in pursuit of Lee to intercept the retreating
army.This pursuit was started early on the 3d.On the evening of that
date there was some firing between the pursuing army and Lee's rear guard.It was Lee's design to concentrate his force at Amelia Court House, but
this was not to be accomplished by the night of the 4th.Not until the 5th
was the whole army up, and then it was discovered that no adequate
supplies were within less than fifty miles.Subsistence could be obtained
only by foraging parties.No word of complaint from the suffering men
reached their commander, and on the evening of that disappointing day they
patiently and silently began the sad march anew.Their course was through
unfavorable territory and necessarily slow.The Federals were gaining upon
their retreating columns.Sheridan's cavalry had reached their flank, and
on the 6th there was heavy skirmishing.In the afternoon the Federals had
arrived in force sufficient to bring on an engagement with Ewell's corps
in the rear, at Sailor's Creek, a tributary of the Appomattox River.Ewell
was surrounded by the Federals and the entire corps captured.General
Anderson, commanding the divisions of Pickett and Johnson, was attacked
and fought bravely, losing many men.In all about six thousand Confederate
soldiers were left in the hands of the pursuing army.On the night of the 6th, the remainder of the Confederate army continued
the retreat and arrived at Farmville, where the men received two days'
rations, the first food except raw or parched corn that had been given
them for two days.Again the tedious journey was resumed, in the hope of
breaking through the rapidly-enmeshing net and forming a junction with
Johnston at Danville, or of gaining the protected region of the mountains
near Lynchburg.But the progress of the weak and weary marchers was slow
and the Federal cavalry had swept around to Lee's front, and a halt was
necessary to check the pursuing Federals.On the evening of the 8th, Lee
reached Appomattox Court House.Here ended the last march of the Army of
Northern Virginia.General Lee and his officers held a council of war on the night of the 8th
and it was decided to make an effort to cut their way through the Union
lines on the morning of the next day.On the 7th, while at Farmville, on
the south side of the Appomattox River, Grant sent to Lee a courteous
request for the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, based on the
hopelessness of further resistance on the part of that army.In reply, Lee
expressed sympathy with Grant's desire to avoid useless effusion of blood
and asked the terms of surrender.The next morning General Grant replied to Lee, urging that a meeting be
designated by Lee, and specifying the terms of surrender, to which Lee
replied promptly, rejecting those terms, which were, that the Confederates
lay down their arms, and the men and officers be disqualified for taking
up arms against the Government of the United States until properly
exchanged.When Grant read Lee's letter he shook his head in
disappointment and said, "It looks as if Lee still means to fight; I will
reply in the morning."On the 9th Grant addressed another communication to Lee, repeating the
terms of surrender, and closed by saying, "The terms upon which peace can
be had are well understood.By the South laying down their arms they will
hasten that most desirable event, save thousands of human lives, and
hundreds of millions of property not yet destroyed.Sincerely hoping that
all our difficulties may be settled without the loss of another life, I
subscribe myself, etc."There remained for Lee the bare possibility, by desperate fighting, of
breaking through the Federal lines in his rear.To Gordon's corps was
assigned the task of advancing on Sheridan's strongly supported front.Since Pickett's charge at Gettysburg there had been no more hopeless
movement in the annals of the war.It was not merely that Gordon was
overwhelmingly outnumbered by the opposing forces, but his
hunger-enfeebled soldiers, even if successful in the first onslaught,
could count on no effective support, for Longstreet's corps was in even
worse condition than his own.Nevertheless, on the morning of Sunday, the
9th, the attempt was made.Gordon was fighting his corps, as he said, "to
a frazzle," when Lee came at last to a realizing sense of the futility of
it all and ordered a truce.A meeting with Grant was soon arranged on the
basis of the letters already exchanged.The conference of the two
world-famous commanders took place at Appomattox, a small settlement with
only one street, but to be made historic by this meeting.Lee was awaiting
Grant's arrival at the house of Wilmer McLean.It was here, surrounded by
staff-officers, that the terms were written by Grant for the final
surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia.The terms, and their
acceptance, were embodied in the following letters, written and signed in
the famous "brick house" on that memorable Sunday:

    APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE, VIRGINIA,
    APRIL 9, 1865.GENERAL: In accordance with the substance of my letter to you of the
    8th instant, I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of
    Northern Virginia on the following terms, to wit: Rolls of all the
    officers and men to be made in duplicate, one copy to be given to an
    officer to be designated by me, the other to be retained by such
    officer or officers as you may designate.The officers to give their
    individual paroles not to take up arms against the Government of the
    United States until properly exchanged; and each company or regimental
    commander to sign a like parole for the men of their commands.The
    arms, artillery, and public property to be parked and stacked, and
    turned over to the officers appointed by me to receive them.This will
    not embrace the side-arms of the officers, nor their private horses or
    baggage.This done, each officer and man will be allowed to return to
    his home, not to be disturbed by the United States authority so long
    as they observe their paroles and the laws in force where they may
    reside.U. S. GRANT, _Lieutenant-General_.HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,
    APRIL 9, 1865.GENERAL: I have received your letter of this date containing the terms
    of the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia as proposed by you.As they are substantially the same as those expressed in your letter
    of the 8th instant, they are accepted.I will proceed to designate the
    proper officers to carry the stipulation into effect.R. E. LEE, _General_.Lieutenant-General U. S. Grant.When Federal officers were seen galloping toward the Union lines from
Appomattox Court House it was quickly surmised that Lee had surrendered.Cheer after cheer was sent up by the long lines throughout their entire
length; caps and tattered colors were waved in the air.Officers and men
alike joined in the enthusiastic outburst.It was glad tidings, indeed, to
these men, who had fought and hoped and suffered through the long bloody
years.When Grant returned to his headquarters and heard salutes being fired he
ordered it stopped at once, saying, "The war is over; the rebels are our
countrymen again; and the best sign of rejoicing after the victory will be
to abstain from all demonstration in the field."Details of the surrender were arranged on the next day by staff-officers
of the respective armies.The parole officers were instructed by General
Grant to permit the Confederate soldiers to retain their own horses--a
concession that was most welcome to many of the men, who had with them
animals brought from the home farm early in the war.There were only twenty-eight thousand men to be paroled, and of these
fewer than one-third were actually bearing arms on the day of the
surrender.The Confederate losses of the last ten days of fighting
probably exceeded ten thousand.The Confederate supplies had been captured by Sheridan, and Lee's army was
almost at the point of starvation.An order from Grant caused the rations
of the Federal soldiers to be shared with the "Johnnies," and the
victorious "Yanks" were only too glad to tender such hospitality as was
within their power.These acts of kindness were slight in themselves, but
they helped immeasurably to restore good feeling and to associate for all
time with Appomattox the memory of reunion rather than of strife.The
things that were done there can never be the cause of shame to any
American.The noble and dignified bearing of the commanders was an example
to their armies and to the world that quickly had its effect in the
genuine reconciliation that followed.The scene between Lee and his devoted army was profoundly touching.General Long in his "Memoirs of Lee" says: "It is impossible to describe
the anguish of the troops when it was known that the surrender of the army
was inevitable.Of all their trials, this was the greatest and hardest to
endure."As Lee rode along the lines of the tried and faithful men who had
been with him at the Wilderness, at Spotsylvania, and at Cold Harbor, it
was not strange that those ragged, weather-beaten heroes were moved by
deep emotion and that tears streamed down their bronzed and scarred faces.Their general in broken accents admonished them to go to their homes and
be as brave citizens as they had been soldiers.Thus ended the greatest civil war in history, for soon after the fall of
the Confederate capital and the surrender of Lee's army, there followed in
quick succession the surrender of all the remaining Southern forces.While these stirring events were taking place in Virginia, Sherman, who
had swept up through the Carolinas with the same dramatic brilliancy that
marked his march to the sea, accomplishing most effective work against
Johnston, was at Goldsboro.When Johnston learned of the fall of Richmond
and Lee's surrender he knew the end had come and he soon arranged for the
surrender of his army on the terms agreed upon at Appomattox.In the first
week of May General "Dick" Taylor surrendered his command near Mobile, and
on the 10th of the same month, President Jefferson Davis, who had been for
nearly six weeks a fugitive, was overtaken and made a prisoner near
Irwinsville, Georgia.The Southern Confederacy was a thing of the past.[Illustration: MEN ABOUT TO WITNESS APPOMATTOX

No photographer was present at Appomattox, that supreme moment in our
national history, when Americans met for the last time as foes on the
field.Nothing but fanciful sketches exist of the scene inside the McLean
home.But here is a photograph that shows most of the Union officers
present at the conference.Nine of the twelve men standing above stood
also at the signing of Lee's surrender, a few days later.The scene is
City Point, in March, 1865.Grant is surrounded by a group of the officers
who had served him so faithfully.At the surrender, it was Colonel T. S.
Bowers (third from left) upon whom Grant called to make a copy of the
terms of surrender in ink.Colonel E. S. Parker, the full-blooded Indian
on Grant's staff, an excellent penman, wrote out the final copy.Nineteen
years later, General Horace Porter recorded with pride that he loaned
General Lee a pencil to make a correction in the terms.Colonels William
Duff and J. D. Webster, and General M. R. Patrick, are the three men who
were not present at the interview.All of the remaining officers were
formally presented to Lee.General Seth Williams had been Lee's adjutant
when the latter was superintendent at West Point some years before the
war.In the lower photograph General Grant stands between General Rawlins
and Colonel Bowers.The veins standing out on the back of his hand are
plainly visible.No one but he could have told how calmly the blood
coursed through them during the four tremendous years.[Illustration: GRANT BETWEEN RAWLINS AND BOWERS]


[Illustration: IN PETERSBURG--AFTER NINE MONTHS OF BATTERING

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This fine mansion on Bolingbroke Street, the residential section of
Petersburg, has now, on the 3d of April, fallen into the hands of
straggling Union soldiers.Its windows have long since been shattered by
shells from distant Federal mortars; one has even burst through the wall.But it was not till the night of April 2d, when the retreat of the
Confederate forces started, that the citizens began to leave their homes.At 9 o'clock in the morning General Grant, surrounded by his staff, rode
quietly into the city.At length they arrived
at a comfortable home standing back in a yard.There he dismounted and sat
for a while on the piazza.Soon a group of curious citizens gathered on
the sidewalk to gaze at the commander of the Yankee armies.But the Union
troops did not remain long in the deserted homes.Sheridan was already in
pursuit south of the Appomattox, and Grant, after a short conference with
Lincoln, rode to the west in the rear of the hastily marching troops.Bolingbroke Street and Petersburg soon returned to the ordinary
occupations of peace in an effort to repair the ravages of the historic
nine months' siege.[Illustration: APPOMATTOX STATION--LEE'S LAST ATTEMPT TO PROVISION HIS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]At this railroad point, three miles from the Court House, a Confederate
provision train arrived on the morning of April 8th.The supplies were
being loaded into wagons and ambulances by a detail of about four thousand
men, many of them unarmed, when suddenly a body of Federal cavalry charged
upon them, having reached the spot by a by-road leading from the Red
House.After a few shots the Confederates fled in confusion.The cavalry
drove them on in the direction of Appomattox Court House, capturing many
prisoners, twenty-five pieces of artillery, a hospital train, and a large
pack of wagons.This was Lee's last effort to obtain food for his army.[Illustration: FEDERAL SOLDIERS WHO PERFORMED ONE OF THE LAST DUTIES AT

The sad significance of these photographs is all too apparent.Not only
the bank buildings were in ruins, but the financial system of the entire
South.All available capital had been consumed by the demands of the war,
and a system of paper currency had destroyed credit completely.Worse
still was the demoralization of all industry.Through large areas of the
South all mills and factories were reduced to ashes, and everywhere the
industrial system was turned topsy-turvy.Truly the problem that
confronted the South was stupendous.[Illustration: WRECK OF THE GALLEGO FLOUR MILLS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Never again to be used by brother against brother, these Confederate guns
captured in the defenses about Richmond are parked near the wharves on the
James River ready for shipment to the national arsenal at Washington, once
more the capital of a united country.The reflection of these instruments
of destruction on the peaceful surface of the canal is not more clear than
was the purpose of the South to accept the issues of the war and to
restore as far as in them lay the bases for an enduring prosperity.The
same devotion which manned these guns so bravely and prolonged the contest
as long as it was possible for human powers to endure, was now directed to
the new problems which the cessation of hostilities had provided.The
restored Union came with the years to possess for the South a significance
to be measured only by the thankfulness that the outcome had been what it
was and by the pride in the common traditions and common blood of the
whole American people.These captured guns are a memory therefore, not of
regret, but of recognition, gratitude, that the highest earthly tribunal
settled all strife in 1865.[Illustration: COEHORNS, MORTARS, LIGHT AND HEAVY GUNS]


[Illustration: LINCOLN THE LAST SITTING--ON THE DAY OF LEE'S SURRENDER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]On April 9, 1865, the very day of the surrender of Lee at Appomattox,
Lincoln, for the last time, went to the photographer's gallery.As he sits
in simple fashion sharpening his pencil, the man of sorrows cannot forget
the sense of weariness and pain that for four years has been unbroken.No
elation of triumph lights the features.One task is ended--the Nation is
saved.But another, scarcely less exacting, confronts him.The States
which lay "out of their proper practical relation to the Union," in his
own phrase, must be brought back into a proper practical relation.Only five days later the sad eyes reflected
upon this page closed forever upon scenes of earthly turmoil.Bereft of
Lincoln's heart and head, leaders attacked problems of reconstruction in
ways that proved unwise.As the mists of passion and prejudice cleared
away, both North and South came to feel that this patient, wise, and
sympathetic ruler was one of the few really great men in history, and that
he would live forever in the hearts of men made better by his presence
during those four years of storm.[Illustration: THE RETURN OF THE SOLDIERS--THE GRAND REVIEW

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.One of the proudest days of the nation--May 24, 1865--here lives again.The true greatness of the American people was not displayed till the close
of the war.The citizen from the walks of humble life had during the
contest become a veteran soldier, equal in courage and fighting capacity
to the best drilled infantry of Marlborough, Frederick the Great, or
Napoleon.But it remained to be seen whether he would return peacefully to
the occupations of peace."Would
nearly a million men," they asked, "one of the mightiest military
organizations ever trained in war, quietly lay aside this resistless power
and disappear into the unnoted walks of civil life?"The disbanded veterans
lent the effectiveness of military order and discipline to the industrial
and commercial development of the land they had come to love with an
increased devotion.The pictures are of Sherman's troops marching down
Pennsylvania Avenue.The horsemen in the lead are General Francis P. Blair
and his staff, and the infantry in flashing new uniforms are part of the
Seventeenth Corps in the Army of Tennessee.Little over a year before,
they had started with Sherman on his series of battles and flanking
marches in the struggle for Atlanta.They had taken a conspicuous and
important part in the battle of July 22d east of Atlanta, receiving and
finally repulsing attacks in both front and rear.They had marched with
Sherman to the sea and participated in the capture of Savannah.They had
joined in the campaign through the Carolinas, part of the time leading the
advance and tearing up many miles of railway track, and operating on the
extreme right after the battle of Bentonville.After the negotiations for
Johnston's surrender were completed in April, they set out on the march
for the last time with flying colors and martial music, to enter the
memorable review at Washington in May, here preserved.[Illustration: THE SAME SCENE, A FEW SECONDS LATER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.“Jack, from May,” is written upon the back of the card in a large
girlish scrawl.That is all; there is no date, no love or good wishes
sent, only those three words: “Jack, from May;” and in front of the
card, beneath the glittering snow scene and intermingling with the
scarlet wreath, the Christmas benediction: “Glory to God in the
highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”

“Who’s May, I wonder,” Ruby murmurs again, almost jealously.“P’raps
another little girl in Scotland he never told me about.I wonder why he
didn’t speak about her.”

Ruby does not know that the “May” of the carefully cherished card is
a little girl of whom Jack but rarely speaks, though she lives in his
thoughts day and night.Far away in Scotland a blue-eyed maiden’s heart
is going out in longing to the man who only by his absence had proved
to the friend of his childhood how much she loved him.Her heart is in
sunny Australia, and his in bonnie Scotland, all for love each of the
other.Having failed, even with the best intentions to discover who May is,
Ruby turns her attention to the picture and the text.“‘Glory to God in the highest,’” the little girl reads--“that’s out of
the Bible--‘and on earth peace, good will toward men.’ I wonder what
‘good will’ means?I s’pose p’raps it just means to be kind.”

All around the child is the monotonous silence of the Australian noon,
unbroken save by the faint silvery wash of the creek over the stones
on its way to the river, and the far-away sound of old Hans’ axe as he
“rings” the trees.To be “kind,” that is what the Christmas text means
in Ruby’s mind, but there is no one here to be “kind” to.“And of course that card would be made in Scotland, where there are
lots of people to be kind to,” the little girl decides thoughtfully.She is gazing out far away over the path which leads to the coast.Beyond that lies the sea, and beyond the sea Scotland.What would not
Ruby give to be in bonnie Scotland just now!The child rises and goes through the house and across the courtyard
to the stables.The stables are situated on the fourth side of the
quadrangle; but at present are but little used, as most of the horses
are grazing at their own sweet will in the adjoining paddock just now.Dick comes out of the coach-house pulling his forelock.This building
is desolate save for a very dilapidated conveyance termed “buggy” in
Australia.“Wantin’ to go for a ride, Miss Ruby?” Dick asks.Dick is Ruby’s
cavalier upon those occasions when she desires to ride abroad.“Smuttie’s out in the paddock.I’ll catch him for you if you like,” he
adds.“Bring him round to the gate,” his young mistress says.“I’ll have got
on my things by the time you’ve got him ready.”

Smuttie is harnessed and ready by the time Ruby reappears.He justifies
his name, being a coal-black pony, rather given over to obesity, but a
good little fellow for all that.Dick has hitched his own pony to the
garden-gate, and now stands holding Smuttie’s bridle, and awaiting his
little mistress’s will.The sun streams brightly down upon them as they start, Ruby riding
slowly ahead.In such weather Smuttie prefers to take life easily.It
is with reluctant feet that he has left the paddock at all; but now
that he has, so to speak, been driven out of Eden, he is resolved in
his pony heart that he will not budge one hair’s-breadth quicker than
necessity requires.Dick has fastened a handkerchief beneath his broad-brimmed hat, and his
young mistress is not slow to follow his example and do the same.“Hot enough to start a fire without a light,” Dick remarks from behind
as they jog along.“I never saw one,” Ruby returns almost humbly.She knows that Dick
refers to a bush fire, and that for a dweller in the bush she ought
long before this to have witnessed such a spectacle.“I suppose it’s
very frightsome,” Ruby adds.I should just think so!” Dick ejaculates.He laughs to
himself at the question.“Saw one the last place I was in,” the boy
goes on.Your pa’s never had one
here, Miss Ruby; but it’s not every one that’s as lucky.It’s just
like”--Dick pauses for a simile--“like a steam-engine rushing along,
for all the world, the fire is.Then you can see it for miles and miles
away, and it’s all you can do to keep up with it and try to burn on
ahead to keep it out.If you’d seen one, Miss Ruby, you’d never like to
see another.”

Rounding a thicket, they come upon old Hans, the German, busy in his
employment of “ringing” the trees.This ringing is the Australian
method of thinning a forest, and consists in notching a ring or circle
about the trunks of the trees, thus impeding the flow of sap to the
branches, and causing in time their death.The trees thus “ringed”
form indeed a melancholy spectacle, their long arms stretched bare and
appealingly up to heaven, as if craving for the blessing of growth now
for ever denied them.The old German raises his battered hat respectfully to the little
mistress.“Hot day, missie,” he mutters as salutation.“You must be dreadfully hot,” Ruby says compassionately.The old man’s face is hot enough in all conscience.He raises his
broad-brimmed hat again, and wipes the perspiration from his damp
forehead with a large blue-cotton handkerchief.“It’s desp’rate hot,” Dick puts in as his item to the conversation.“You ought to take a rest, Hans,” the little girl suggests with ready
commiseration.“I’m sure dad wouldn’t mind.He doesn’t like me to do
things when it’s so hot, and he wouldn’t like you either.Your face is
just ever so red, as red as the fire, and you look dreadful tired.”

“Ach!and I _am_ tired,” the old man ejaculates, with a broad smile.But a little more work, a little more tiring out,
and the dear Lord will send for old Hans to be with Him for ever in
that best and brightest land of all.The work has
not come to those little hands of thine yet, but the day may come when
thou too wilt be glad to leave the toil behind thee, and be at rest.but what am I saying?” The smile broadens on the tired old face.“Why do I talk of death to thee, _liebchen_, whose life is all play?The sunlight is made for such as thee, on whom the shadows have not
even begun to fall.”

Ruby gives just the tiniest suspicion of a sob stifled in a sniff.“You’re not to talk like that, Hans,” she remonstrates in rather an
injured manner.“We don’t want you to die--do we, Dick?” she appeals to
her faithful servitor.“No more’n we don’t,” Dick agrees.“So you see,” Ruby goes on with the air of a small queen, “you’re not
to say things like that ever again.And I’ll tell dad you’re not to
work so hard; dad always does what I want him to do--usually.”

The old man looks after the two retreating figures as they ride away.“She’s a dear little lady, she is,” he mutters to himself.“But she
can’t be expected to understand, God bless her!how the longing comes
for the home-land when one is weary.Good Lord, let it not be long.”
The old man’s tired eyes are uplifted to the wide expanse of blue,
beyond which, to his longing vision, lies the home-land for which he
yearns.Then, wiping his axe upon his shirt-sleeve, old Hans begins his
“ringing” again.“He’s a queer old boy,” Dick remarks as they ride through the sunshine.Though a servant, and obliged to ride behind, Dick sees no reason why
he should be excluded from conversation.She would have
found those rides over the rough bush roads very dull work had there
been no Dick to talk to.“He’s a nice old man!” Ruby exclaims staunchly.“He’s just tired, or
he wouldn’t have said that,” she goes on.She has an idea that Dick is
rather inclined to laugh at German Hans.They are riding along now by the river’s bank, where the white clouds
floating across the azure sky, and the tall grasses by the margin are
reflected in its cool depths.About a mile or so farther on, at the
turn of the river, a ruined mill stands, while, far as eye can reach on
every hand, stretch unending miles of bush.Dick’s eyes have been fixed
on the mill; but now they wander to Ruby.“We’d better turn ’fore we get there, Miss Ruby,” he recommends,
indicating the tumbledown building with the willowy switch he has been
whittling as they come along.“That’s the place your pa don’t like you
for to pass--old Davis, you know.Your pa’s been down on him lately for
stealing sheep.”

“I’m sure dad won’t mind,” cries Ruby, with a little toss of the head.“And I want to go,” she adds, looking round at Dick, her bright face
flushed with exercise, and her brown hair flying behind her like a
veritable little Amazon.Dick knows by sore experience that when
this little lady wants her own way she usually gets it.“Your pa said,” he mutters; but it is all of no avail, and they
continue their course by the river bank.The cottage stands with its back to the river, the mill, now idle and
unused, is built alongside.Once on a day this same mill was a busy
enough place, now it is falling to decay for lack of use, and no sign
or sound either there or at the cottage testify to the whereabouts of
the lonely inhabitant.An enormous brindled cat is mewing upon the
doorstep, a couple of gaunt hens and a bedraggled cock are pacing the
deserted gardens, while from a lean-to outhouse comes the unmistakable
grunt of a pig.“He’s not at home,” he mutters.“I’m just as glad, for your pa would
have been mighty angry with me.Somewhere not far off he’ll be, I
reckon, and up to no good.Come along, Miss Ruby; we’d better be
getting home, or the mistress’ll be wondering what’s come over you.”

They are riding homewards by the river’s bank, when they come upon a
curious figure.An old, old man, bent almost double under his load of
<DW19>s, his red handkerchief tied three cornered-wise beneath his chin
to protect his ancient head from the blazing sun.The face which looks
out at them from beneath this strange head-gear is yellow and wizened,
and the once keen blue eyes are dim and bleared, yet withal there is a
sort of low cunning about the whole countenance which sends a sudden
shiver to Ruby’s heart, and prompts Dick to touch up both ponies with
that convenient switch of his so smartly as to cause even lethargic
Smuttie to break into a canter.“Who is he?” Ruby asks in a half-frightened whisper as they slacken
pace again.She looks over her shoulder as she asks the question.The old man is standing just as they left him, gazing after them
through a flood of golden light.“He’s an old wicked one!” he mutters.“That’s him, Miss Ruby, him as we
were speaking about, old Davis, as stole your pa’s sheep.Your pa would
have had him put in prison, but that he was such an old one.He’s a bad
lot though, so he is.”

“He’s got a horrid face.I don’t like his face one bit,” says Ruby.Her
own face is very white as she speaks, and her brown eyes ablaze.“I
wish we hadn’t seen him,” shivers the little girl, as they set their
faces homewards.[Illustration]

CHAPTER IV.“I kissed thee when I went away
    On thy sweet eyes--thy lips that smiled.I heard thee lisp thy baby lore--
    Thou wouldst not learn the word farewell.God’s angels guard thee evermore,
    Till in His heaven we meet and dwell!”

                               HANS ANDERSON.It is stilly night, and she is
standing down by the creek, watching the dance and play of the water
over the stones on its way to the river.All around her the moonlight
is streaming, kissing the limpid water into silver, and in the deep
blue of the sky the stars are twinkling like gems on the robe of the
great King.Not a sound can the little girl hear save the gentle murmur of the
stream over the stones.All the world--the white, white, moon-radiant
world--seems to be sleeping save Ruby; she alone is awake.Stranger than all, though she is all alone, the child feels no sense of
dread.She is content to stand there, watching the moon-kissed stream
rushing by, her only companions those ever-watchful lights of heaven,
the stars.Faint music is sounding in her ears, music so faint and far away that
it almost seems to come from the streets of the Golden City, where the
redeemed sing the “new song” of the Lamb through an endless day.Ruby
strains her ears to catch the notes echoing through the still night in
faint far-off cadence.Nearer, ever nearer, it comes; clearer, ever clearer, ring those glad
strains of joy, till, with a great, glorious rush they seem to flood
the whole world:

“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace; good will toward men!”

“It’s on Jack’s card!” Ruby cannot help exclaiming; but the words die
away upon her lips.Gazing upwards, she sees such a blaze of glory as almost seems to blind
her.Strangely enough the thought that this is only a dream, and the
attendant necessity of pinching, do not occur to Ruby just now.She is gazing upwards in awestruck wonder to the shining sky.What is
this vision of fair faces, angel faces, hovering above her, faces
shining with a light which “never was on land or sea,” the radiance
from their snowy wings striking athwart the gloom?And in great, glorious unison the grand old Christmas carol rings
forth--

“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace; good will toward men!”

Open-eyed and awestruck, the little girl stands gazing upwards, a
wonder fraught with strange beauty at her heart.Can it be possible
that one of those bright-faced angels may be the mother whom Ruby never
knew, sent from the far-off land to bear the Christmas message to the
child who never missed a mother’s love because she never knew it?“Oh, mamma,” cries poor Ruby, stretching appealing hands up to the
shining throng, “take me with you!Take me with you back to heaven!”

She hardly knows why the words rise to her lips.Heaven has never been
a very real place to this little girl, although her mother is there;
the far-off city, with its pearly gates and golden streets, holds but
a shadowy place in Ruby’s heart, and before to-night she has never
greatly desired to enter therein.The life of the present has claimed all her attention, and, amidst
the joys and pleasures of to-day, the coming life has held but little
place.But now, with heaven’s glories almost opened before her, with
the “new song” of the blessed in her ears, with her own long-lost
mother so near, Ruby would fain be gone.Slowly the glory fades away, the angel faces grow dimmer and dimmer,
the heavenly music dies into silence, and the world is calm and hushed
as before.Still Ruby stands gazing upwards, longing for the angel
visitants to come again.But no heavenly light illumines the sky, only
the pale radiance of the moon, and no sound breaks upon the child’s
listening ear save the monotonous music of the ever-flowing water.With a disappointed little sigh, Ruby brings her gaze back to earth
again.The white moonlight is flooding the country for miles around,
and in its light the ringed trees in the cleared space about the
station stand up gaunt and tall like watchful sentinels over this
home in the lonely bush.Yet Ruby has no desire to retrace her steps
homewards.It may be that the angel host with their wondrous song will
come again.So the child lingers, throwing little pebbles in the brook,
and watching the miniature circles widen and widen, brightened to
limpid silver in the sheeny light.A halting footstep makes her turn her head.There, a few paces away,
a bent figure is coming wearifully along, weighted down beneath its
bundle of <DW19>s.Near Ruby it stumbles and falls, the <DW19>s
rolling from the wearied back down to the creek, where, caught by a
boulder, they swing this way and that in the flowing water.Involuntarily the child gives a step forward, then springs back with
a sudden shiver.“It’s the wicked old one,” she whispers.“And I
_couldn’t_ help him!Oh, I _couldn’t_ help him!”

“On earth peace, good will toward men!” Faint and far away is the echo,
yet full of meaning to the child’s heart.She gives a backward glance
over her shoulder at the fallen old man.He is groping with his hands
this way and that, as though in darkness, and the blood is flowing from
a cut in the ugly yellow wizened face.“If it wasn’t _him_,” Ruby mutters.“If it was anybody else but the
wicked old one; but I can’t be kind to _him_.”

“On earth peace, good will toward men!” Clearer and clearer rings out
the angel benison, sent from the gates of heaven, where Ruby’s mother
waits to welcome home again the husband and child from whose loving
arms she was so soon called away.To be “kind,” that is what Ruby has
decided “good will” means.Is she, then, being kind, to the old man
whose groping hands appeal so vainly to her aid?“Dad wouldn’t like me to,” decides Ruby, trying to stifle the voice of
conscience.“And he’s _such_ a horrid old man.”

Clearer and still clearer, higher and still higher rings out the
angels’ singing.There is a queer sort of tugging going on at Ruby’s
heart.She knows she ought to go back to help old Davis and yet she
cannot--cannot!Then a great flash of light comes before her eyes, and Ruby suddenly
wakens to find herself in her own little bed, the white curtains drawn
closely to ward off mosquitoes, and the morning sun slanting in and
forming a long golden bar on the opposite curtain.The little girl rubs her eyes and stares about her.She, who has so
often even doubted reality, finds it hard to believe that what has
passed is really a dream.Even yet the angel voices seem to be sounding
in her ears, the heavenly light dazzling her eyes.“And they weren’t angels, after all,” murmurs Ruby in a disappointed
voice.“It was only a dream.”

Only a dream!How many of our so-called realities are “only a dream,”
from which we waken with disappointed hearts and saddened eyes.One far
day there will come to us that which is not a dream, but a reality,
which can never pass away, and we shall awaken in heaven’s morning,
being “satisfied.”

“Dad,” asks Ruby as they go about the station that morning, she hanging
on her father’s arm, “what was my mamma like--my own mamma, I mean?”

The big man smiles, and looks down into the eager little face uplifted
to his own.“Your own mamma, little woman,” he repeats gently.of course you don’t remember her.You remind me of her, Ruby, in a
great many ways, and it is my greatest wish that you grow up just such
a woman as your dear mother was.I
don’t think you ever asked me about your mother before.”

“I just wondered,” says Ruby.She is gazing up into the cloudless blue
of the sky, which has figured so vividly in her dream of last night.“I
wish I remembered her,” Ruby murmurs, with the tiniest sigh.“Poor little lassie!” says the father, patting the small hand.“Her
greatest sorrow was in leaving you, Ruby.You were just a baby when she
died.Not long before she went away she spoke about you, her little
girl whom she was so unwilling to leave.‘Tell my little Ruby,’ she
said, ‘that I shall be waiting for her.I have prayed to the dear Lord
Jesus that she may be one of those whom He gathers that day when He
comes to make up His jewels.’ She used to call you her little jewel,
Ruby.”

“And my name means a jewel,” says Ruby, looking up into her father’s
face with big, wondering brown eyes.The dream mother has come nearer
to her little girl during those last few minutes than she has ever
done before.Those words, spoken so long ago, have made Ruby feel her
long-dead young mother to be a real personality, albeit separated from
the little girl for whom one far day she had prayed that Christ might
number her among His jewels.In that fair city, “into which no foe can
enter, and from which no friend can ever pass away,” Ruby’s mother has
done with all care and sorrow.God Himself has wiped away all tears
from her eyes for ever.Ruby goes about with a very sober little face that morning.She gathers
fresh flowers for the sitting-room, and carries the flower-glasses
across the courtyard to the kitchen to wash them out.This is one of
Ruby’s customary little duties.She has a variety of such small tasks
which fill up the early hours of the morning.After this Ruby usually
conscientiously learns a few lessons, which her step-mother hears her
recite now and then, as the humour seizes her.But at present Ruby is enjoying holidays in honour of Christmas,
holidays which the little girl has decided shall last a month or more,
if she can possibly manage it.“You’re very quiet to-day, Ruby,” observes her step-mother, as the
child goes about the room, placing the vases of flowers in their
accustomed places.Thorne is reclining upon her favourite sofa,
the latest new book which the station affords in her hand.“Aren’t you
well, child?” she asks.“Am I quiet?” Ruby says.“I didn’t notice, mamma.I’m all right.”

It is true, as the little girl has said, that she has not even noticed
that she is more quiet than usual.Involuntarily her thoughts have
gone out to the mother whom she never knew, the mother who even now is
waiting in sunny Paradise for the little daughter she has left behind.Since she left her so long ago, Ruby has hardly given a thought to her
mother.The snow is lying thick on her grave in the little Scottish
kirkyard at home; but Ruby has been happy enough without her, living
her own glad young life without fear of death, and with no thought to
spare for the heaven beyond.But now the radiant vision of last night’s dream, combined with her
father’s words, have set the child thinking.Will the Lord Jesus indeed
answer her mother’s prayer, and one day gather little Ruby among His
jewels?Will he care very much that this little jewel of His has never
tried very hard throughout her short life to work His will or do His
bidding?What if, when the Lord Jesus comes, He finds Ruby all unworthy
to be numbered amongst those jewels of His?And the long-lost mother,
who even in heaven will be the gladder that her little daughter is with
her there, how will she bear to know that the prayer she prayed so long
ago is all in vain?“And if he doesn’t gather me,” Ruby murmurs, staring straight up into
the clear, blue sky, “what shall I do?Oh, what shall I do?”

CHAPTER V.

THE BUSH FIRE.“Will you shew yourself gentle, and be merciful for Christ’s sake
    to poor and needy people, and to all strangers destitute of help?”

    “I will so shew myself, by God’s help.”

                     _Consecration of Bishops, Book of Common Prayer._


Jack’s card is placed upright on the mantel-piece of Ruby’s bedroom,
its back leaning against the wall, and before it stands a little girl
with a troubled face, and a perplexed wrinkle between her brows.“It says it there,” Ruby murmurs, the perplexed wrinkle deepening.“And
that text’s out of the Bible.But when there’s nobody to be kind to, I
can’t do anything.”

The sun is glinting on the frosted snow scene; but Ruby is not looking
at the snow scene.Her eyes are following the old, old words of the
first Christmas carol: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace, good will toward men!”

“If there was only anybody to be kind to,” the little girl repeats
slowly.“Dad and mamma don’t need me to be kind to them, and I _am_
quite kind to Hans and Dick.If it was only in Scotland now; but it’s
quite different here.”

The soft summer wind is swaying the window-blinds gently to and fro,
and ruffling with its soft breath the thirsty, parched grass about the
station.To the child’s mind has come a remembrance, a remembrance of
what was “only a dream,” and she sees an old, old man, bowed down with
the weight of years, coming to her across the moonlit paths of last
night, an old man whom Ruby had let lie where he fell, because he was
only “the wicked old one.”

“It was only a dream, so it didn’t matter.” Thus the little girl tries
to soothe a suddenly awakened conscience.“And he _is_ a wicked old
one; Dick said he was.”

Ruby goes over to the window, and stands looking out.There is no
change in the fair Australian scene; on just such a picture Ruby’s eyes
have rested since first she came.But there is a strange, unexplained
change in the little girl’s heart.Only that the dear Lord Jesus has
come to Ruby, asking her for His dear sake to be kind to one of the
lowest and humblest of His creatures.“If it was only anybody else,”
she mutters.“But he’s so horrid, and he has such a horrid face.And I
don’t see what I could do to be kind to such a nasty old man as he is.Besides, perhaps dad wouldn’t like me.”

“Good will toward men!Good will toward men!” Again the heavenly
voices seem ringing in Ruby’s ears.There is no angel host about her
to strengthen and encourage her, only one very lonely little girl who
finds it hard to do right when the doing of that right does not quite
fit in with her own inclinations.She has taken the first step upon the
heavenly way, and finds already the shadow of the cross.The radiance of the sunshine is reflected in Ruby’s brown eyes, the
radiance, it may be, of something far greater in her heart.“I’ll do it!” the little girl decides suddenly.“I’ll try to be kind to
the ‘old one.’ Only what can I do?”

“Miss Ruby!” cries an excited voice at the window, and, looking out,
Ruby sees Dick’s brown face and merry eyes.“Come ’long as quick as
you can.There’s a fire, and you said t’other day you’d never seen one.I’ll get Smuttie if you come as quick as you can.It’s over by old
Davis’s place.”

Dick’s young mistress does not need a second bidding.She is out
waiting by the garden-gate long before Smuttie is caught and harnessed.Away to the west she can see the long glare of fire shooting up tongues
of flame into the still sunlight, and brightening the river into a very
sea of blood.“I don’t think you should go, Ruby,” says her mother, who has come
out on the verandah.“It isn’t safe, and you are so venturesome.I am
dreadfully anxious about your father too.Dick says he and the men are
off to help putting out the fire; but in such weather as this I don’t
see how they can ever possibly get it extinguished.”

“I’ll be very, very careful, mamma,” Ruby promises.Her brown eyes
are ablaze with excitement, and her cheeks aglow.“And I’ll be there
to watch dad too, you know,” she adds persuasively in a voice which
expresses the belief that not much danger can possibly come to dad
while his little girl is near.Dick has brought Smuttie round to the garden-gate, and in a moment he
and his little mistress are off, cantering as fast as Smuttie can be
got to go, to the scene of the fire.Those who have witnessed a fire in the bush will never forget it.The
first spark, induced sometimes by a fallen match, ignited often by the
excessive heat of the sun’s rays, gains ground with appalling rapidity,
and where the growth is dry, large tracts of ground have often been
laid waste.In excessively hot weather this is more particularly the
case, and it is then found almost impossible to extinguish the fire.“Look at it!” Dick cries excitedly.“Goin’ like a steam-engine just.Wish we hadn’t brought Smuttie, Miss Ruby.He’ll maybe be frightened at
the fire.they’ve got the start of it.Do you see that other fire
on ahead?That’s where they’re burning down!”

Ruby looks.Yes, there _are_ two fires, both, it seems, running, as
Dick has said, “like steam-engines.”

“My!” the boy cries suddenly; “it’s the old wicked one’s house.It’s it
that has got afire.There’s not enough
of them to do that, and to stop the fire too.And it’ll be on to your
pa’s land if they don’t stop it pretty soon.I’ll have to help them,
Miss Ruby.You’ll have to get off Smuttie and hold
him in case he gets scared at the fire.”

“Oh, Dick!” the little girl cries.Her face is very pale, and her eyes
are fixed on that lurid light, ever growing nearer.“Do you think
he’ll be dead?Do you think the old man’ll be dead?”

“Not him,” Dick returns, with a grin.“He’s too bad to die, he is.but I wish he was dead!” the boy ejaculates.“It would be a good
riddance of bad rubbish, that’s what it would.”

“Oh, Dick,” shivers Ruby, “I wish you wouldn’t say that.I’ve never been kind!” Ruby
breaks out in a wail, which Dick does not understand.They are nearing the scene of the fire now.Luckily the cottage is
hard by the river, so there is no scarcity of water.Stations are scarce and far between in the
Australian bush, and the inhabitants not easily got together.There are
two detachments of men at work, one party endeavouring to extinguish
the flames of poor old Davis’s burning cottage, the others far in
the distance trying to stop the progress of the fire by burning down
the thickets in advance, and thus starving the main fire as it gains
ground.This method of “starving the fire” is well known to dwellers in
the Australian bush, though at times the second fire thus given birth
to assumes such proportions as to outrun its predecessor.“It’s not much use.It’s too dry,” Dick mutters.“I don’t like leaving
you, Miss Ruby; but I’ll have to do it.Even a boy’s a bit of help in
bringing the water.You don’t mind, do you, Miss Ruby?I think, if I
was you, now that you’ve seen it, I’d turn and go home again.Smuttie’s
easy enough managed; but if he got frightened, I don’t know what you’d
do.”

“I’ll get down and hold him,” Ruby says.“I want to watch.” Her heart
is sick within her.She has never seen a fire before, and it seems so
fraught with danger that she trembles when she thinks of dad, the being
she loves best on earth.“Go you away to the fire, Dick,” adds Ruby,
very pale, but very determined.“I’m not afraid of being left alone.”

The fire is gaining ground every moment, and poor old Davis’s desolate
home bids fair to be soon nothing but a heap of blackened ruins.Dick gives one look at the burning house, and another at his little
mistress.There is no time to waste if he is to be of any use.“I don’t like leaving you, Miss Ruby,” says Dick again; but he goes all
the same.Ruby, left alone, stands by Smuttie’s head, consoling that faithful
little animal now and then with a pat of the hand.It is hot,
scorchingly hot; but such cold dread sits at the little girl’s heart
that she does not even feel the heat.In her ears is the hissing of
those fierce flames, and her love for dad has grown to be a very agony
in the thought that something may befall him.“Ruby!” says a well-known voice, and through the blaze of sunlight she
sees her father coming towards her.His face, like Ruby’s, is very
pale, and his hands are blackened with the grime and soot.“You ought
not to be here, child.Away home to your mother,
and tell her it is all right, for I know she will be feeling anxious.”

“But is it all right, dad?” the little girl questions anxiously.Her
eyes flit from dad’s face to the burning cottage, and then to those
other figures in the lurid light far away.“And mamma _will_ be
frightened; for she’ll think you’ll be getting hurt.And so will I,”
adds poor Ruby with a little catch in her voice.“What nonsense, little girl,” says her father cheerfully.“There,
dear, I have no time to wait, so get on Smuttie, and let me see you
away.That’s a brave little girl,” he adds, stooping to kiss the small
anxious face.It is with a sore, sore heart that Ruby rides home lonely by the
river’s side.She has not waited for her trouble to come to her, but
has met it half way, as more people than little brown-eyed Ruby are too
fond of doing.Dad is the very dearest thing Ruby has in the whole wide
world, and if anything happens to dad, whatever will she do?“I just couldn’t bear it,” murmurs poor Ruby, wiping away a very big
tear which has fallen on Smuttie’s broad back.Ah, little girl with the big, tearful, brown eyes, you have still to
learn that any trouble can be borne patiently, and with a brave face to
the world, if only God gives His help![Illustration]




[Illustration]




CHAPTER VI.“I CAN NEVER DO IT NOW!”

          “Then, darling, wait;
          Nothing is late,
  In the light that shines for ever!”


That is a long, long day to Ruby.From Glengarry they can watch far
away the flames, like so many forked and lurid tongues of fire, leaping
up into the still air and looking strangely out of place against
the hazy blue of the summer sky.The little girl leaves her almost
untouched dinner, and steals out to the verandah, where she sits, a
forlorn-looking little figure, in the glare of the afternoon sunshine,
with her knees drawn up to her chin, and her brown eyes following
eagerly the pathway by the river where she has ridden with Dick no
later than this morning.This morning!--to waiting Ruby it seems more
like a century ago.Jenny finds her there when she has washed up the dinner dishes, tidied
all for the afternoon, and come out to get what she expresses as a
“breath o’ caller air,” after her exertions of the day.The “breath
o’ air” Jenny may get; but it will never be “caller” nor anything
approaching “caller” at this season of the year.Poor Jenny, she may
well sigh for the fresh moorland breezes of bonnie Scotland with its
shady glens, where the bracken and wild hyacinth grow, and where the
very plash of the mountain torrent or “sough” of the wind among the
trees, makes one feel cool, however hot and sultry it may be.“Ye’re no cryin’, Miss Ruby?” ejaculates Jenny.“No but that the heat
o’ this outlandish place would gar anybody cry.What’s wrong wi’ ye, ma
lambie?” Jenny can be very gentle upon occasion.“Are ye no weel?” For
all her six years of residence in the bush, Jenny’s Scotch tongue is
still aggressively Scotch.Ruby raises a face in which tears and smiles struggle hard for mastery.“I’m not crying, _really_, Jenny,” she answers.“Only,” with a
suspicious droop of the dark-fringed eye-lids and at the corners of the
rosy mouth, “I was pretty near it.I can’t help watching the flames, and thinking that something might
perhaps be happening to him, and me not there to know.And then I began
to feel glad to think how nice it would be to see him and Dick come
riding home.Jenny, how _do_ little girls get along who have no
father?”

It is strange that Ruby never reflects that her own mother has gone
from her.“The Lord A’mighty tak’s care o’ such,” Jenny responds solemnly.“Ye’ll just weary your eyes glowerin’ awa’ at the fire like that, Miss
Ruby.They say that ‘a watched pot never boils,’ an’ I’m thinkin’ your
papa’ll no come a meenit suner for a’ your watchin’.Gae in an’ rest
yersel’ like the mistress.She’s sleepin’ finely on the sofa.”

Ruby gives a little impatient wriggle.“How can I, Jenny,” she exclaims
piteously, “when dad’s out there?I don’t know whatever I would do
if anything was to happen to dad.”

“Pit yer trust in the Lord, ma dearie,” the Scotchwoman says
reverently.“Ye’ll be in richt gude keepin’ then, an’ them ye love as
weel.”

But Ruby only wriggles again.She does not want Jenny’s solemn talk.Dad, whom she loves so dearly, and whose little
daughter’s heart would surely break if aught of ill befell him.So the long, long afternoon wears away, and when is an afternoon so
tedious as when one is eagerly waiting for something or some one?Jenny goes indoors again, and Ruby can hear the clatter of plates and
cups echoing across the quadrangle as she makes ready the early tea.The child’s eyes are dim with the glare at which she has so long been
gazing, and her limbs, in their cramped position, are aching; but Ruby
hardly seems to feel the discomfort from which those useful members
suffer.She goes in to tea with a grudge, listens to her stepmother’s
fretful little complaints with an absent air which shows how far away
her heart is, and returns as soon as she may to her point of vantage.“Oh, me!” sighs the poor little girl.“Will he never come?”

Out in the west the red sun is dying grandly in an amber sky, tinged
with the glory of his life-blood, when dad at length comes riding home.Ruby has seen him far in the distance, and runs out past the gate to
meet him.“Oh, dad darling!” she cries.“I did think you were never coming.Oh,
dad, are you hurt?” her quick eyes catching sight of his hand in a
sling.“Only a scratch, little girl,” he says.“Don’t
frighten the mother about it.Poor little Ruby red, were you
frightened?Did you think your old father was to be killed outright?”

“I didn’t know,” Ruby says.“And mamma was
frightened too.And when even Dick didn’t come back.Oh, dad, wasn’t it
just dreadful--the fire, I mean?”

Black Prince has been put into the paddock, and Ruby goes into the
house, hanging on her father’s uninjured arm.The child’s heart has
grown suddenly light.The terrible fear which has been weighing her
down for the last few hours has been lifted, and Ruby is her old joyous
self again.“Dad,” the little girl says later on.They are sitting out on the
verandah, enjoying the comparative cool of the evening.“What will
he do, old Davis, I mean, now that his house is burnt down?It won’t
hardly be worth while his building another, now that he’s so old.”

Dad does not answer just for a moment, and Ruby, glancing quickly
upwards, almost fancies that her father must be angry with her; his
face is so very grave.Perhaps he does not even wish her to mention the
name of the old man, who, but that he is “so old,” should now have been
in prison.“Old Davis will never need another house now, Ruby,” Dad answers,
looking down into the eager little upturned face.God has taken him away, dear.”

“He’s dead?” Ruby questions with wide-open, horror-stricken eyes.The little girl hardly hears her father as he goes on to tell her how
the old man’s end came, suddenly and without warning, crushing him in
the ruins of his burning cottage, where the desolate creature died
as he had lived, uncared for and alone.Into Ruby’s heart a great,
sorrowful regret has come, regret for a kind act left for ever undone,
a kind word for ever unspoken.“And I can never do it now!” the child sobs.“He’ll never even know I
wanted to be kind to him!”

“Kind to whom, little girl?” her father asks wonderingly.And it is in those kind arms that Ruby sobs out her story.“I can never
do it now!” that is the burden of her sorrow.The late Australian twilight gathers round them, and the stars twinkle
out one by one.But, far away in the heaven which is beyond the stars
and the dim twilight of this world, I think that God knows how one
little girl, whose eyes are now dim with tears, tried to be “kind,”
and it may be that in His own good time--and God’s time is always the
best--He will let old Davis “know” also.[Illustration]




CHAPTER VII.“There came a glorious morning, such a one
  As dawns but once a season.Mercury
  On such a morning would have flung himself
  From cloud to cloud, and swum with balanced wings
  To some tall mountain: when I said to her,
  ‘A day for gods to stoop,’ she answered ‘Ay,
  And men to soar.’”

                                          TENNYSON.Ruby goes about her work and play very gravely for the next few days.A great sorrow sits at her heart which only time can lighten and chase
away.She is very lonely, this little girl--lonely without even knowing
it, but none the less to be pitied on that account.To her step-mother
Ruby never even dreams of turning for comfort or advice in her small
troubles and griefs.Dad is his little girl’s _confidant_; but, then,
dad is often away, and in Mrs.Thorne’s presence Ruby never thinks of
confiding in her father.It is a hot sunny morning in the early months of the new year.Ruby is
riding by her father’s side along the river’s bank, Black Prince doing
his very best to accommodate his long steps to Smuttie’s slower amble.Far over the long flats of uncultivated bush-land hangs a soft blue
haze, forerunner of a day of intense heat.But Ruby and dad are early
astir this morning, and it is still cool and fresh with the beautiful
young freshness of a glorious summer morning.“It’s lovely just now,” Ruby says, with a little sigh of satisfaction.“I wish it would always stay early morning; don’t you, dad?It’s like
where it says in the hymn about ‘the summer morn I’ve sighed for.’
P’raps that means that it will always be morning in heaven.I hope it
will.”

“It will be a very fair summer morn anyway, little girl,” says dad, a
sudden far-away look coming into his brown eyes.At the child’s words, his thoughts have gone back with a sudden rush of
memory to another summer’s morning, long, long ago, when he knelt by
the bedside where his young wife lay gasping out her life, and watched
Ruby’s mother go home to God.“I’ll be waiting for you, Will,” she had
whispered only a little while before she went away.“It won’t be so
very long, my darling; for even heaven won’t be quite heaven to me with
you away.” And as the dawning rose over the purple hill-tops, and the
birds’ soft twitter-twitter gave glad greeting to the new-born day, the
angels had come for Ruby’s mother, and the dawning for her had been the
glorious dawning of heaven.Many a year has passed away since then, sorrowfully enough at first for
the desolate husband, all unheeded by the child, who never missed her
mother because she never knew her.Nowadays new hopes, new interests
have come to Will Thorne, dimming with their fresher links the dear old
days of long ago.He has not forgotten the love of his youth, never
will; but time has softened the bitterness of his sorrow, and caused
him to think but with a gentle regret of the woman whom God had called
away in the suntime of her youth.But Ruby’s words have come to him
this summer morning awakening old memories long slumbering, and his
thoughts wander from the dear old days, up--up--up to God’s land on
high, where, in the fair summer morning of Paradise, one is waiting
longingly, hopefully--one who, even up in heaven, will be bitterly
disappointed if those who in the old days she loved more than life
itself will not one day join her there.“Dad,” Ruby asks quickly, uplifting a troubled little face to that
other dear one above her, “what is the matter?You looked so sorry, so
very sorry, just now,” adds the little girl, with something almost like
a sob.Did I?” says the father, with a swift sudden smile.He bends
down to the little figure riding by his side, and strokes the soft,
brown hair.“I was thinking of your mother, Ruby,” dad says.“But
instead of looking sorry I should have looked glad, that for her all
tears are for ever past, and that nothing can ever harm her now.I was
thinking of her at heaven’s gate, darling, watching, as she said she
would, for you and for me.”

“I wonder,” says Ruby, with very thoughtful brown eyes, “how will I
know her?God will have to tell her,
won’t He?And p’raps I’ll be quite grown up ’fore I die, and mother
won’t think it’s her own little Ruby at all.I wish I knew,” adds the
child, in a puzzled voice.“God will make it all right, dear.I have no fear of that,” says the
father, quickly.It is not often that Ruby and he talk as they are doing now.Like all
true Scotchmen, he is reticent by nature, reverencing that which is
holy too much to take it lightly upon his lips.As for Ruby, she has
never even thought of such things.In her gay, sunny life she has had
no time to think of the mother awaiting her coming in the land which
to Ruby, in more senses than one, is “very far off.”

Far in the distance the early sunshine gleams on the river, winding out
and in like a silver thread.The tall trees stand stiffly by its banks,
their green leaves faintly rustling in the soft summer wind.And above
all stretches the blue, blue sky, flecked here and there by a fleecy
cloud, beyond which, as the children tell us, lies God’s happiest land.It is a fair scene, and one which Ruby’s eyes have gazed on often,
with but little thought or appreciation of its beauty.But to-day her
thoughts are far away, beyond another river which all must pass, where
the shadows only fall the deeper because of the exceeding brightness
of the light beyond.And still another river rises before the little
girl’s eyes, a river, clear as crystal, the “beautiful, beautiful
river” by whose banks the pilgrimage of even the most weary shall one
day cease, the burden of even the most heavy-laden, one day be laid
down.On what beauties must not her mother’s eyes be now gazing!But
even midst the joy and glory of the heavenly land, how can that fond,
loving heart be quite content if Ruby, one far day, is not to be with
her there?All the way home the little girl is very thoughtful, and a strange
quietness seems to hang over usually merry Ruby for the remainder of
the day.But towards evening a great surprise is in store for her.Dick, whose
duty it is, when his master is otherwise engaged, to ride to the
nearest post-town for the letters, arrives with a parcel in his bag,
addressed in very big letters to “Miss Ruby Thorne.” With fingers
trembling with excitement the child cuts the string.Within is a long
white box, and within the box a doll more beautiful than Ruby has ever
even imagined, a doll with golden curls and closed eyes, who, when
set upright, discloses the bluest of blue orbs.She is dressed in the
daintiest of pale blue silk frocks, and tiny bronze shoes encase her
feet.She is altogether, as Ruby ecstatically exclaims, “a love of a
doll,” and seems but little the worse for her long journey across the
briny ocean.“It’s from Jack!” cries Ruby, her eyes shining.“Oh, and here’s a
letter pinned to dolly’s dress!What a nice writer he is!” The child’s
cheeks flush redly, and her fingers tremble even more as she tears the
envelope open.“I’ll read it first to myself, mamma, and then I’ll give
it to you.”

    “MY DEAR LITTLE RUBY” (so the letter runs),

    “I have very often thought of you since last we parted, and now do
    myself the pleasure of sending madam across the sea in charge of
    my letter to you.She is the little bird I would ask to whisper
    of me to you now and again, and if you remember your old friend
    as well as he will always remember you, I shall ask no more.How
    are the dollies?Bluebell and her other ladyship--I have forgotten
    her name.I often think of you this bleak, cold weather, and envy
    you your Australian sunshine just as, I suppose, you often envy
    me my bonnie Scotland.I am looking forward to the day when you
    are coming home on that visit you spoke of.We must try and have
    a regular jollification then, and Edinburgh, your mother’s home,
    isn’t so far off from Greenock but that you can manage to spend
    some time with us.My mother bids me say that she will expect you
    and your people.Give my kindest regards to your father and mother,
    and, looking forward to next Christmas,

                          “I remain, my dear little Ruby red,
                                                “Your old friend,
                                                             “JACK.”

“Very good of him to take so much trouble on a little girl’s account,”
remarks Mrs.Thorne, approvingly, when she too has perused the letter.It is the least you can do, after his kindness, and I am
sure he would like to have a letter from you.”

“I just love him,” says Ruby, squeezing her doll closer to her.“I wish
I could call the doll after him; but then, ‘Jack’ would never do for
a lady’s name.I know what I’ll do!” with a little dance of delight.“I’ll call her ‘May’ after the little girl who gave Jack the card, and
I’ll call her ‘Kirke’ for her second name, and that’ll be after Jack.I’ll tell him that when I write, and I’d better send him back his card
too.”

That very evening, Ruby sits down to laboriously compose a letter to
her friend.“MY DEAR JACK” (writes Ruby in her large round hand),

[“I don’t know what else to say,” murmurs the little girl, pausing with
her pen uplifted.“I never wrote a letter before.”

“Thank him for the doll, of course,” advises Mrs.Thorne, with an
amused smile.“That is the reason for your writing to him at all, Ruby.”

So Ruby, thus adjured, proceeds--]

    “Thank you very much for the doll.I am calling her ‘May Kirke,’ after the name on your card, and
    after your own name; because I couldn’t call her ‘Jack.’ We are
    having very hot weather yet; but not so hot as when you were here.The dolls are not quite well, because Fanny fell under old Hans’
    waggon, and the waggon went over her face and squashed it.I am
    very sorry, because I liked her, but your doll will make up.Thank
    you for writing me.Mamma says I am to send her kindest regards to
    you.It won’t be long till next Christmas now.I am sending you
    back your card.“With love, from your little friend,
                                                               “RUBY.“P.S.--Dad has come in now, and asks me to remember him to you.I
    have had to write this all over again; mamma said it was so badly
    spelt.”

Jack Kirke’s eyes soften as he reads the badly written little letter,
and it is noticeable that when he reaches a certain point where two
words, “May Kirke,” appear, he stops and kisses the paper on which they
are written.Such are the excessively foolish antics of young men who happen to be
in love.[Illustration]

CHAPTER VIII.“The Christmas bells from hill to hill
  Answer each other in the mist.”

                               TENNYSON.Christmas Day again; but a white, white Christmas this time--a
Christmas Day in bonnie Scotland.In the sitting-room of an old-fashioned house in Edinburgh a little
brown-haired, brown-eyed girl is dancing about in an immense state
of excitement.She is a merry-looking little creature, with rosy
cheeks, and wears a scarlet frock, which sets off those same cheeks to
perfection.“Can’t you be still even for a moment, Ruby?”

“No, I can’t,” the child returns.“And neither could you, Aunt Lena,
if you knew my dear Jack.Oh, he’s just a dear!I wonder what’s keeping
him?What if he’s just gone on straight home to Greenock without
stopping here at all.what if there’s been a collision.Dad says there are quite often collisions in Scotland!” cries Ruby,
suddenly growing very grave.“What if the skies were to fall?Just about as probable, you wild
little Australian,” laughs the lady addressed as Aunt Lena, who bears
sufficient resemblance to the present Mrs.Thorne to proclaim them
to be sisters.“You must expect trains to be late at Christmas time,
Ruby.But of course you can’t be expected to know that, living in the
Australian bush all your days.Poor, dear Dolly, I wonder how she ever
survived it.”

“Mamma was very often ill,” Ruby returns very gravely.“She didn’t
like being out there at all, compared with Scotland.‘Bonnie Scotland’
Jenny always used to call it.But I do think,” adds the child, with
a small sigh and shiver as she glances out at the fast-falling snow,
“that Glengarry’s bonnier.There are so many houses here, and you can’t
see the river unless you go away up above them all.P’raps though in
summer,” with a sudden regret that she has possibly said something
not just quite polite.“And then when grandma and you are always used
to it.It’s different with me; I’ve been always used to Glengarry.Oh,” cries Ruby, with a sudden, glad little cry, and dash to the
front door, “here he is at last!Oh, Jack, Jack!” Aunt Lena can hear
the shrill childish voice exclaiming.“I thought you were just never
coming.I thought p’raps there had been a collision.” And presently
the dining-room door is flung open, and Ruby, now in a high state of
excitement, ushers in her friend.Miss Lena Templeton’s first feeling is one of surprise, almost of
disappointment, as she rises to greet the new-comer.The “Jack” Ruby
had talked of in such ecstatic terms had presented himself before the
lady’s mind’s eye as a tall, broad-shouldered, handsome man, the sort
of man likely to take a child’s fancy; ay, and a woman’s too.But the real Jack is insignificant in the extreme.At such a man one
would not bestow more than a passing glance.So thinks Miss Templeton
as her hand is taken in the young Scotchman’s strong grasp.His face,
now that the becoming bronze of travel has left it, is colourlessly
pale, his merely medium height lessened by his slightly stooping form.It is his eyes which suddenly and irresistibly
fascinate Miss Lena, seeming to look her through and through, and when
Jack smiles, this young lady who has turned more than one kneeling
suitor from her feet with a coldly-spoken “no,” ceases to wonder how
even the child has been fascinated by the wonderful personality of
this plain-faced man.“I am very glad to make your acquaintance, Miss Templeton,” Jack Kirke
says.“It is good of you to receive me for Ruby’s sake.” He glances
down at the child with one of his swift, bright smiles, and squeezes
tighter the little hand which so confidingly clasps his.“I’ve told Aunt Lena all about you, Jack,” Ruby proclaims in her shrill
sweet voice.“She said she was quite anxious to see you after all I had
said.Jack, can’t you stay Christmas with us?It would be lovely if
you could.”

“We shall be very glad if you can make it convenient to stay and eat
your Christmas dinner with us, Mr.Kirke,” Miss Templeton says.“In
such weather as this, you have every excuse for postponing your journey
to Greenock for a little.”

“Many thanks for your kindness, Miss Templeton,” the young man
responds.“I should have been most happy, but that I am due at Greenock
this afternoon at my mother’s.She is foolish enough to set great store
by her unworthy son, and I couldn’t let her have the dismal cheer
of eating her Christmas dinner all alone.Two years ago,” the young
fellow’s voice softens as he speaks, “there were two of us.Nowadays
I must be more to my mother than I ever was, to make up for Wat.He
was my only brother”--all the agony of loss contained in that “was” no
one but Jack Kirke himself will ever know--“and it is little more than
a year now since he died.My poor mother, I don’t know how I had the
heart to leave her alone last Christmas as I did; but I think I was
nearly out of my mind at the time.Anyway I must try to make it up to
her this year, if I possibly can.”

“Was Wat like you?” Ruby asks very softly.She has climbed on her
long-lost friend’s knee, a habit Ruby has not yet grown big enough to
be ashamed of, and sits, gazing up into those other brown eyes.“I wish
I’d known him too,” Ruby says.“A thousand times better,” Wat’s brother returns with decision.“He was
the kindest fellow that ever lived, I think, though it seems queer to
be praising up one’s own brother.If you had known Wat, Ruby, I would
have been nowhere, and glad to be nowhere, alongside of such a fellow
as him.Folks said we were like in a way, to look at; though it was a
poor compliment to Wat to say so; but there the resemblance ended.This
is his photograph,” rummaging his pocket-book--“no, not that one, old
lady,” a trifle hurriedly, as one falls to the ground.“Mayn’t I see it, Jack?” she
petitions.Jack Kirke grows rather red and looks a trifle foolish; but it is
impossible to refuse the child’s request.Had Ruby’s aunt not been
present, it is possible that he might not have minded quite so much.“I like her face,” Ruby determines.“It’s a nice face.”

It is a nice face, this on the photograph, as the child has said.The
face of a girl just stepping into womanhood, fair and sweet, though
perhaps a trifle dreamy, but with that shining in the eyes which tells
how to their owner belongs a gift which but few understand, and which,
for lack of a better name, the world terms “Imagination.” For those
who possess it there will ever be an added glory in the sunset, a
softly-whispered story in each strain of soon-to-be-forgotten music,
a reflection of God’s radiance upon the very meanest things of this
earth.A gift which through all life will make for them all joy
keener, all sorrow bitterer, and which they only who have it can fully
comprehend and understand.“And this is Wat,” goes on Jack, thus effectually silencing the
question which he sees hovering on Ruby’s lips.“I like him, too,” Ruby cries, with shining eyes.“Look, Aunt Lena,
isn’t he nice?Doesn’t he look nice and kind?”

There is just the faintest resemblance to the living brother in the
pictured face upon the card, for in his day Walter Kirke must indeed
have been a handsome man.But about the whole face a tinge of sadness
rests.In the far-away land of heaven God has wiped away all tears for
ever from the eyes of Jack’s brother.In His likeness Walter Kirke has
awakened, and is satisfied for ever.Kirke?” says Ruby’s mother, fluttering into the
room.Thorne is a very different woman from the languid
invalid of the Glengarry days.The excitement and bustle of town life
have done much to bring back her accustomed spirits, and she looks more
like pretty Dolly Templeton of the old days than she has done since
her marriage.We have been out calling on a few
friends, and got detained.Isn’t it a regular Christmas day?I hope
that you will be able to spend some time with us, now that you are
here.”

“I have just been telling Miss Templeton that I have promised to eat
my Christmas dinner in Greenock,” Jack Kirke returns, with a smile.“Business took me north, or I shouldn’t have been away from home in
such weather as this, and I thought it would be a good plan to break my
journey in Edinburgh, and see how my Australian friends were getting
on.My mother intends writing you herself; but she bids me say that
if you can spare a few days for us in Greenock, we shall be more than
pleased.I rather suspect, Ruby, that she has heard so much of you,
that she is desirous of making your acquaintance on her own account,
and discovering what sort of young lady it is who has taken her son’s
heart so completely by storm.”

“Oh, and, Jack,” cries Ruby, “I’ve got May with me.I thought it would be nice to let her see bonnie Scotland again,
seeing she came from it, just as I did when I was ever so little.Can’t
I bring her to Greenock when I come?Because, seeing she is called
after you, she ought really and truly to come and visit you.Oughtn’t
she?” questions Ruby, looking up into the face of May’s donor with very
wide brown eyes.“Of course,” Jack returns gravely.“It would never do to leave May
behind in Edinburgh.” He lingers over the name almost lovingly; but
Ruby does not notice that then.“Dad,” Ruby cries as her father comes into the room, “do you know what?We’re all to go to Greenock to stay with Jack.Isn’t it lovely?”

“Not very flattering to us that you are in such a hurry to get away
from us, Ruby,” observes Miss Templeton, with a slight smile.“Whatever else you have accomplished, Mr.Kirke, you seem to have
stolen one young lady’s heart at least away.”

“I like him,” murmurs Ruby, stroking Jack’s hair in rather a babyish
way she has.“I wouldn’t like never to go back to Glengarry, because I
like Glengarry; but _I should_ like to stay always in Scotland because
Jack’s here.”

CHAPTER IX.“As the stars for ever and ever.”


“Jack,” Ruby says very soberly, “I want you to do something for me.”

Crowning joy has come at last to Ruby.Kirke’s expected letter,
backed by another from her son, has come, inviting the Thornes to spend
the first week of the New Year with them.And now Ruby’s parents have
departed to pay some flying visits farther north, leaving their little
girl, at Mrs.Kirke’s urgent request, to await their return in Greenock.“For Jack’s sake I should be so glad if you could allow her,” Jack’s
mother had said.“It makes everything so bright to have a child’s
presence in the house, and Jack and I have been sad enough since Walter
died.”

Sad enough!Few but Jack could have told
how sad.“Fire away, little Ruby red,” is Jack’s rejoinder.They are in the smoking-room, Jack stretched in one easy chair, Ruby
curled up in another.Jack has been away in dreamland, following with
his eyes the blue wreaths of smoke floating upwards from his pipe to
the roof; but now he comes back to real life--and Ruby.“This is it,” Ruby explains.“You know the day we went down to
Inverkip, dad and I?Well, we went to see mamma’s grave--my own mamma,
I mean.Dad gave me a shilling before he went away, and I thought
I should like to buy some flowers and put them there.It looked so
lonely, and as if everybody had forgotten all about her being buried
there.And she was my own mamma,” adds the little girl, a world of
pathos in her young voice.“So there’s nobody but me to do it.So,
Jack, would you mind?”

“Taking you?” exclaims the young man.“Of course I will, old lady.It’ll be a jolly little excursion, just you and I together.No, not
exactly jolly,” remembering the intent of their journey, “but very
nice.We’ll go to-morrow, Ruby.Luckily the yard’s having holidays just
now, so I can do as I like.As for the flowers, don’t you bother about
them.I’ll get plenty for you to do as you like with.”

“Oh, you are good!” cries the little girl, rising and throwing her arms
round the young man’s neck.“I wish you weren’t so old, Jack, and I’d
marry you when I grew up.”

“But I’m desperately old,” says Jack, showing all his pretty, even,
white teeth in a smile.“Twenty-six if I’m a day.I shall be quite an
old fogey when you’re a nice young lady, Ruby red.Thank you all the
same for the honour,” says Jack, twirling his moustache and smiling to
himself a little.“But you’ll find some nice young squatter in the days
to come who’ll have two words to say to such an arrangement.”

“I won’t ever like anybody so well as you, anyway,” decides Ruby,
resolutely.In the days to come Jack often laughingly recalls this
asseveration to her.“And I don’t think I’ll ever get married.I
wouldn’t like to leave dad.”

The following day sees a young man and a child passing through the
quaint little village of Inverkip, lying about six miles away from the
busy seaport of Greenock, on their way to the quiet churchyard which
encircles the little parish kirk.As Ruby has said, it looks painfully
lonely this winter afternoon, none the less so that the rain and thaw
have come and swept before them the snow, save where it lies in
discoloured patches here and there about the churchyard wall.“I know it by the tombstone,” observes Ruby, cheerfully, as they close
the gates behind them.“It’s a grey tombstone, and mamma’s name below
a lot of others.This is it, I think,” adds the child, pausing before
a rather desolate-looking grey slab.“Yes, there’s her name at the
foot, ‘Janet Stuart,’ and dad says that was her favourite text that’s
underneath--‘Surely I come quickly.Even so come, Lord Jesus.’
I’ll put down the flowers.I wonder,” says Ruby, looking up into Jack’s
face with a sudden glad wonder on her own, “if mamma can look down from
heaven, and see you and me here, and be glad that somebody’s putting
flowers on her grave at last.”

“She will have other things to be glad about, I think, little Ruby,”
Jack Kirke says very gently.“But she will be glad, I am sure, if she
sees us--and I think she does,” the young man adds reverently--“that
through all those years her little girl has not forgotten her.”

“But I don’t remember her,” says Ruby, looking up with puzzled eyes.“Only dad says that before she died she said that he was to tell me
that she would be waiting for me, and that she had prayed the Lord
Jesus that I might be one of His jewels.I’m not!” cries
Ruby, with a little choke in her voice.“And if I’m not, the Lord Jesus
will never gather me, and I’ll never see my mamma again.Even up in
heaven she might p’raps feel sorry if some day I wasn’t there too.”

“I know,” Jack says quickly.He puts his arm about the little girl’s
shoulders, and his own heart goes out in a great leap to this child who
is wondering, as he himself not so very long ago, in a strange mazed
way, wondered too, if even ’midst heaven’s glories another will “feel
sorry” because those left behind will not one far day join them there.“I felt that too,” the young man goes on quietly.“But it’s all right
now, dear little Ruby red.Everything seemed so dark when Wat died,
and I cried out in my misery that the God who could let such things be
was no God for me.But bit by bit, after a terrible time of doubt, the
mists lifted, and God seemed to let me know that He had done the very
best possible for Wat in taking him away, though I couldn’t understand
just yet why.The one thing left for me to do now was to make quite
sure that one day I should meet Wat again, and I couldn’t rest till
I made sure of that.It’s so simple, Ruby, just to believe in the
dear Lord Jesus, so simple, that when at last I found out about it, I
wondered how I could have doubted so long.I can’t speak about such
things,” the young fellow adds huskily, “but I felt that if you feel
about your mother as I did about Wat, that I must help you.Don’t you
see, dear, just to trust in Christ with all your heart that He is able
to save you, and He _will_.It was only for Wat’s sake that I tried to
love Him first; but now I love Him for His own.”

It has cost Ruby’s friend more than the child knows to make even this
simple confession of his faith.But I think that in heaven’s morning
Jack’s crown will be all the brighter for the words he spoke to a
doubting little girl on a never-to-be-forgotten winter’s day.For it is
said that even those who but give to drink of a cup of cold water for
the dear Christ’s sake shall in no wise lose their reward.“I love you, Jack,” is all Ruby says, with a squeeze of her friend’s
hand.“And if I do see mamma in heaven some day, I’ll tell her how
good you’ve been to me.Jack, won’t it be nice if we’re all there
together, Wat and you, and dad and mamma and me?”

Jack does not answer just for a moment.The young fellow’s heart has
gone out with one of those sudden agonizing rushes of longing to the
brother whom he has loved, ay, and still loves, more than life itself.It _must_ be better for Wat--of that Jack with all his loyal heart
feels sure; but oh, how desolately empty is the world to the brother
Jack left behind!One far day God will let they two meet again;
that too Jack knows; but oh, for one hour of the dear old here and
now!In the golden streets of the new Jerusalem Jack will look into
the sorrowless eyes of one whom God has placed for ever above all
trouble, sorrow, and pain; but the lad’s heart cries out with a fierce
yearning for no glorified spirit with crown-decked brow, but the dear
old Wat with the leal home love shining out of his eyes, and the warm
hand-clasp of brotherly affection.Fairer than all earthly music the
song of the redeemed may ring throughout the courts of heaven; but
sweeter far in those fond ears will sound the well-loved tones which
Jack Kirke has known since he was a child.“Yes, dear,” Jack says, with a swift, sudden smile for the eager little
face uplifted to his, “it _will_ be nice.So we must make sure that we
won’t disappoint them, mustn’t we?”

Another face than Ruby’s uprises before the young man’s eyes as he
speaks, the face of the brother whose going had made all the difference
to Jack’s life; but who, up in heaven, had brought him nearer to God
than he ever could have done on earth.Not a dead face, as Jack had
looked his last upon it, but bright and loving as in the dear old days
when the world seemed made for those two, who dreamed such great things
of the wonderful “may be” to come.But now God has raised Wat higher
than even his airy castles have ever reached--to heaven itself, and
brought Jack, by the agony of loss, very near unto Himself.No, Jack
determines, he must make sure that he will never disappoint Wat.The red sun, like a ball of fire, is setting behind the dark, leafless
tree-tops when at last they turn to go, and everything is very still,
save for the faint ripple of the burn through the long flats of field
as it flows out to meet the sea.Fast clasped in Jack’s is Ruby’s
little hand; but a stronger arm than his is guiding both Jack and
Ruby onward.In the dawning, neither Wat nor Ruby’s mother need fear
disappointment now.“I’m glad I came,” says Ruby in a very quiet little voice as the train
goes whizzing home.“There was nobody to come but me, you see, me and
dad, for dad says that mamma had no relations when he married her.They
were all dead, and she had to be a governess to keep herself.Dad says
that he never saw any one so brave as my own mamma was.”

“See and grow up like her, then, little Ruby,” Jack says with one of
his bright, kindly smiles.“It’s the best sight in the world to see a
brave woman; at least _I_ think so,” adds the young man, smiling down
into the big brown eyes looking up into his.He can hardly help marvelling, even to himself, at the situation in
which he now finds himself.How Wat would have laughed in the old
days at the idea of Jack ever troubling himself with a child, Jack,
who had been best known, if not exactly as a child-hater, at least as
a child-avoider.Is it Wat’s mantle
dropped from the skies, the memory of that elder brother’s kindly
heart, which has softened the younger’s, and made him “kind,” as Ruby
one long gone day had tried to be, to all whom he comes in contact
with?For Wat’s sake Jack had first tried to do right; ay, but now it
is for a greater than that dear brother’s, even for Christ’s.Valiant-for-Truth of old renown, Wat has left as sword the legacy of
his great and beautiful charity to the young brother who is to succeed
him in the pilgrimage.“Jack,” Ruby whispers that evening as she kisses her friend good night,
“I’m going to try--you know.I don’t want to disappoint mamma.”

Up in heaven I wonder if the angels were glad that night.There is an old, old verse ringing in my ears, none the
less true that he who spoke it in the far away days has long since gone
home to God: “And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of
the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars
for ever and ever.”

Surely, in the dawning of that “summer morn” Jack’s crown will not be a
starless one.[Illustration]

CHAPTER X.

MAY.“For God above
    Is great to grant, as mighty to make,
  And creates the love to reward the love:
    I claim you still for my own love’s sake!”

                                     BROWNING.Ruby comes into the drawing-room one afternoon to find the facsimile of
the photograph in Jack’s pocket-book sitting with Mrs.“This is our little Australian, May,” the elder lady says, stretching
out her hand to Ruby.“Ruby, darling, this is Miss Leslie.Perhaps Jack
may have told you about her.”

“How do you do, dear?” Miss May Leslie asks.She has a sweet, clear
voice, and just now does not look half so dreamy as in her photograph,
Ruby thinks.Her dark green frock and black velvet hat with ostrich
tips set off her fair hair and delicately tinted face to perfection,
and her blue eyes are shining as she holds out her hand to the little
girl.“I’ve seen your photograph,” Ruby announces, looking up into the sweet
face above her.“It fell out of Jack’s pocket-book one day.He has it
there with Wat’s.I’m going to give him mine to carry there too; for
Jack says he only keeps the people he likes best in it.”

Miss Leslie grows suddenly, and to Ruby it seems unaccountably, as red
as her own red frock.But for all that the little girl cannot help
thinking that she does not look altogether ill-pleased.Kirke
smiles in rather an embarrassed way.“Have you been long in Scotland, Ruby?” the young lady questions, as
though desirous of changing the subject.“We came about the beginning of December,” Ruby returns.And then she
too puts rather an irrelevant question: “Are you May?”

“Well, yes, I suppose I am May,” Miss Leslie answers, laughing in spite
of herself.“But how did you know my name, Ruby?”

“Jack told her, I suppose.Was that it, Ruby?” says Jack’s mother.“And
this is a child, May, who, when she is told a thing, never forgets it.Isn’t that so, little girlie?”

“No, but Jack didn’t tell me,” Ruby answers, lifting wide eyes to her
hostess.“I just guessed that you must be May whenever I came in, and
then I heard auntie call you it.” For at Mrs.Kirke’s own request,
the little girl has conferred upon her this familiar title.“I’ve got
a dolly called after you,” goes on the child with sweet candour.“May
Kirke’s her name, and Jack says it’s the prettiest name he ever heard,
‘May Kirke,’ I mean.For you see the dolly came from Jack, and when I
could only call her half after him, I called her the other half after
you.”

“But, my dear little girl, how did you know my name?” May asks in some
amazement.Her eyes are sparkling as she puts the question.No one
could accuse May Leslie of being dreamy now.“It was on the card,” Ruby announces, triumphantly.Well is it for Jack
that he is not at hand to hear all these disclosures.“Jack left it
behind him at Glengarry when he stayed a night with us, and your name
was on it.Then I knew some other little girl must have given it to
Jack.I didn’t know then that she would be big and grown-up like you.”

“Ruby!I am afraid that you are a sad little tell-tale,” Mrs.It is rather a sore point with her that this pink-and-white
girl should have slighted her only son so far as to refuse his hand
and heart.Poor Jack, he had had more sorrows to bear than Walter’s
death when he left the land of his birth at that sad time.In the fond
mother’s eyes May is not half good enough for her darling son; but
May’s offence is none the more to be condoned on that account.“I must really be going, Mrs.Kirke,” the young lady says, rising.She
cannot bear that any more of Ruby’s revelations, however welcome to
her own ears, shall be made in the presence of Jack’s mother.“I have
inflicted quite a visitation upon you as it is.You will come and see
me, darling, won’t you?” this to Ruby.Kirke if she will be
so kind as to bring you some day.”

“And I’ll bring May Kirke too,” Ruby cries.It may have been the
firelight which sends an added redness to the other May’s cheeks, as
Ruby utters the name which Jack has said is “the prettiest he has ever
heard.”

Ruby escorts her new-found friend down to the hall door, issuing from
which Miss Leslie runs full tilt against a young man coming in.“Oh, Jack,” Ruby cries, “you’re just in time!Miss May’s just going
away.I’ve forgotten her other name, so I’m just going to call her Miss
May.”

“May I see you home?” Jack Kirke asks.“It is too dark now for you to
go by yourself.” He looks straight into the eyes of the girl he has
known since she was a child, the girl who has refused his honest love
because she had no love to give in return, and May’s eyes fall beneath
his gaze.“Very well,” she acquiesces meekly.Ruby, looking out after the two as they go down the dark avenue,
pities them for having to go out on such a dismal night.The little
girl does not know that for them it is soon to be illumined with a
light than which there is none brighter save that of heaven, the truest
land of love.It is rather a silent walk home, the conversation made up of the most
common of common-places--Jack trying to steel himself against this
woman, whom, try as he will, he cannot thrust out of his loyal heart;
May tortured by that most sorrowful of all loves, the love which came
too late; than which there is none sadder in this grey old world to-day.“What a nice little girl Ruby is,” says May at length, trying to fill
up a rather pitiful gap in the conversation.“Your mother seems so fond
of her.I am sure she will miss her when she goes.”

“She’s the dearest little girl in the world,” Jack Kirke declares.His
eyes involuntarily meet May’s blue ones, and surely something which was
not there before is shining in their violet depths--“except,” he says,
then stops.“May,” very softly, “will you let me say it?”

May answers nothing; but, though she droops her head, Jack sees her
eyes are shining.They say that silence gives consent, and evidently
in this case it must have done so, or else the young man in question
chooses to translate it in that way.So the stars smile down on an
old, old story, a story as old as the old, old world, and yet new and
fresh as ever to those who for the first time scan its wondrous pages;
a story than which there is none sweeter on this side of time, the
beautiful, glamorous mystery of “love’s young dream.”

“And are you sure,” Jack asks after a time, in the curious manner
common to young lovers, “that you really love me now, May?that I
shan’t wake up to find it all a mistake as it was last time.I’m very
dense at taking it in, sweetheart; but it almost seems yet as though it
was too good to be true.”

“Quite sure,” May says.She looks up into the face of the man beside
whom all others to her are but “as shadows,” unalterable trust in her
blue eyes.“Jack,” very low, “I think I have loved you all my life.”

       *       *       *       *       *

“_I_ said I would marry you, Jack,” Ruby remarks in rather an offended
voice when she hears the news.“But I s’pose you thought I was too
little.”

“That was just it, Ruby red,” Jack tells her, and stifles further
remonstrance by a kiss.PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED

  Text in italics is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.I've said he was a fool--but,
hang it all!that's no reason why he should marry an ignorant girl--a
foreigner and a servant--when he could do better elsewhere.""This would seem to be a matter between you and your brother, and not
between myself and my servant," said Miss Trotter coldly."If you
cannot convince HIM, your own brother, I do not see how you expect me
to convince HER, a servant, over whom I have no control except as a
mistress of her WORK, when, on your own showing, she has everything
to gain by the marriage.Bilson, the proprietor, to
threaten her with dismissal unless she gives up your brother,"--Miss
Trotter smiled inwardly at the thought of the card-room incident,--"it
seems to me you might only precipitate the marriage."His reason told him
that she was right.More than that, a certain admiration for her
clear-sightedness began to possess him, with the feeling that he would
like to have "shown up" a little better than he had in this interview.If Chris had fallen in love with HER--but Chris was a fool and wouldn't
have appreciated her!"But you might talk with her, Miss Trotter," he said, now completely
subdued."Even if you could not reason her out of it, you might find
out what she expects from this marriage.If you would talk to her as
sensibly as you have to me"--

"It is not likely that she will seek my assistance as you have," said
Miss Trotter, with a faint smile which Mr.Calton thought quite pretty,
"but I will see about it."Whatever Miss Trotter intended to do did not transpire.She certainly
was in no hurry about it, as she did not say anything to Frida that day,
and the next afternoon it so chanced that business took her to the bank
and post-office.Her way home again lay through the Summit woods.It
recalled to her the memorable occasion when she was first a witness to
Frida's flirtations.Bilson's presumed gallantries,
however, seemed inconsistent, in Miss Trotter's knowledge of the world,
with a serious engagement with young Calton.She was neither shocked nor
horrified by it, and for that reason she had not thought it necessary to
speak of it to the elder Mr.Her path wound through a thicket fragrant with syringa and southernwood;
the faint perfume was reminiscent of Atlantic hillsides, where, long
ago, a girl teacher, she had walked with the girl pupils of the Vermont
academy, and kept them from the shy advances of the local swains.She
smiled--a little sadly--as the thought occurred to her that after this
interval of years it was again her business to restrain the callow
affections.Should she never have the matchmaking instincts of her sex;
never become the trusted confidante of youthful passion?Young Calton
had not confessed his passion to HER, nor had Frida revealed her secret.Only the elder brother had appealed to her hard, practical common sense
against such sentiment.Was there something in her manner that forbade
it?She wondered if it was some uneasy consciousness of this quality
which had impelled her to snub the elder Calton, and rebelled against
it.It was quite warm; she had been walking a little faster than her usual
deliberate gait, and checked herself, halting in the warm breath of the
syringas.Here she heard her name called in a voice that she recognized,
but in tones so faint and subdued that it seemed to her part of her
thoughts.She turned quickly and beheld Chris Calton a few feet
from her, panting, partly from running and partly from some nervous
embarrassment.His handsome but weak mouth was expanded in an
apologetic smile; his blue eyes shone with a kind of youthful appeal so
inconsistent with his long brown mustache and broad shoulders that she
was divided between a laugh and serious concern."I saw you--go into the wood--but I lost you," he said, breathing
quickly, "and then when I did see you again--you were walking so fast
I had to run after you.I wanted--to speak--to you--if you'll let me.I
won't detain you--I can walk your way."Miss Trotter was a little softened, but not so much as to help him out
with his explanation.She drew her neat skirts aside, and made way for
him on the path beside her."You see," he went on nervously, taking long strides to her shorter
ones, and occasionally changing sides in his embarrassment, "my brother
Jim has been talking to you about my engagement to Frida, and trying to
put you against her and me.He said as much to me, and added you half
promised to help him!But I didn't believe him--Miss Trotter!--I know
you wouldn't do it--you haven't got it in your heart to hurt a poor
girl!He says he has every confidence in you--that you're worth a dozen
such girls as she is, and that I'm a big fool or I'd see it.I don't
say you're not all he says, Miss Trotter; but I'm not such a fool as he
thinks, for I know your GOODNESS too.I know how you tended me when
I was ill, and how you sent Frida to comfort me.You know, too,--for
you're a woman yourself,--that all you could say, or anybody could,
wouldn't separate two people who loved each other."Miss Trotter for the first time felt embarrassed, and this made her a
little angry."I don't think I gave your brother any right to speak
for me or of me in this matter," she said icily; "and if you are quite
satisfied, as you say you are, of your own affection and Frida's, I do
not see why you should care for anybody'sinterference.""Now you are angry with me," he said in a doleful voice which at any
other time would have excited her mirth; "and I've just done it.Oh,
Miss Trotter, don't!I didn't mean to say your talk
was no good.I didn't mean to say you couldn't help us.He reached out his hand, grasped her slim fingers in his own, and
pressed them, holding them and even arresting her passage.The act was
without familiarity or boldness, and she felt that to snatch her hand
away would be an imputation of that meaning, instead of the boyish
impulse that prompted it.She gently withdrew her hand as if to continue
her walk, and said, with a smile:--

"Then you confess you need help--in what way?"Was
it possible that this common, ignorant girl was playing and trifling
with her golden opportunity?"Then you are not quite sure of her?""She's so high spirited, you know," he said humbly, "and so attractive,
and if she thought my friends objected and were saying unkind things
of her,--well!"--he threw out his hands with a suggestion of hopeless
despair--"there's no knowing what she might do."Miss Trotter's obvious thought was that Frida knew on which side her
bread was buttered; but remembering that the proprietor was a widower,
it occurred to her that the young woman might also have it buttered on
both sides.Her momentary fancy of uniting two lovers somehow weakened
at this suggestion, and there was a hardening of her face as she said,
"Well, if YOU can't trust her, perhaps your brother may be right.""I don't say that, Miss Trotter," said Chris pleadingly, yet with a
slight wincing at her words; "YOU could convince her, if you would only
try.Only let her see that she has some other friends beside myself.Miss Trotter, I'll leave it all to you--there!If you will only
help me, I will promise not to see her--not to go near her again--until
you have talked with her.Even my brother would not object
to that.And if he has every confidence in you, I'm showing you I've
more--don't you see?Come, now, promise--won't you, dear Miss Trotter?"He again took her hand, and this time pressed a kiss upon her slim
fingers.Indeed, it seemed to
her, in the quick recurrence of her previous sympathy, as if a hand
had been put into her loveless past, grasping and seeking hers in its
loneliness.None of her school friends had ever appealed to her like
this simple, weak, and loving young man.Perhaps it was because they
were of her own sex, and she distrusted them.Nevertheless, this momentary weakness did not disturb her good common
sense.She looked at him fixedly for a moment, and then said, with a
faint smile, "Perhaps she does not trust YOU.He felt himself reddening with a strange embarrassment.It was not so
much the question that disturbed him as the eyes of Miss Trotter; eyes
that he had never before noticed as being so beautiful in their color,
clearness, and half tender insight.He dropped her hand with a new-found
timidity, and yet with a feeling that he would like to hold it longer."I mean," she said, stopping short in the trail at a point where a
fringe of almost impenetrable "buckeyes" marked the extreme edge of the
woods,--"I mean that you are still very young, and as Frida is
nearly your own age,"--she could not resist this peculiarly feminine
innuendo,--"she may doubt your ability to marry her in the face of
opposition; she may even think my interference is a proof of it; but,"
she added quickly, to relieve his embarrassment and a certain abstracted
look with which he was beginning to regard her, "I will speak to her,
and," she concluded playfully, "you must take the consequences."He said "Thank you," but not so earnestly as his previous appeal might
have suggested, and with the same awkward abstraction in his eyes.Miss
Trotter did not notice it, as her own eyes were at that moment fixed
upon a point on the trail a few rods away."Look," she said in a lower
voice, "I may have the opportunity now for there is Frida herself
passing."It was indeed the
young girl walking leisurely ahead of them.There was no mistaking
the smart pink calico gown in which Frida was wont to array her rather
generous figure, nor the long yellow braids that hung Marguerite-wise
down her back.With the consciousness of good looks which she always
carried, there was, in spite of her affected ease, a slight furtiveness
in the occasional swift turn of her head, as if evading or seeking
observation."I will overtake her and speak to her now," continued Miss Trotter."I
may not have so good a chance again to see her alone.You can wait here
for my return, if you like."he stammered, with a
faint, tentative smile."Perhaps--don't you think?--I had better go
first and tell her you want to see her.You see,
she might"--He stopped."It was part of your promise, you know, that you
were NOT to see her again until I had spoken.She has just gone into the
grove."Without another word the young man turned away, and she presently saw
him walking toward the pine grove into which Frida had disappeared.Then
she cleared a space among the matted moss and chickweed, and, gathering
her skirts about her, sat down to wait.The unwonted attitude, the
whole situation, and the part that she seemed destined to take in this
sentimental comedy affected her like some quaint child's play out of her
lost youth, and she smiled, albeit with a little heightening of color
and lively brightening of her eyes.Indeed, as she sat there listlessly
probing the roots of the mosses with the point of her parasol, the
casual passer-by might have taken herself for the heroine of some love
tryst.She had a faint consciousness of this as she glanced to the right
and left, wondering what any one from the hotel who saw her would think
of her sylvan rendezvous; and as the recollection of Chris kissing her
hand suddenly came back to her, her smile became a nervous laugh, and
she found herself actually blushing!He
was walking directly towards her with slow, determined steps, quite
different from his previous nervous agitation, and as he drew nearer she
saw with some concern an equally strange change in his appearance: his
colorful face was pale, his eyes fixed, and he looked ten years older."I came back to tell you," he said, in a voice from which all trace of
his former agitation had passed, "that I relieve you of your promise.It
won't be necessary for you to see--Frida.I thank you all the same, Miss
Trotter," he said, avoiding her eyes with a slight return to his boyish
manner."It was kind of you to promise to undertake a foolish errand for
me, and to wait here, and the best thing I can do is to take myself off
now and keep you no longer.Sometime I may tell
you, but not now."asked Miss Trotter quickly, premising Frida's
refusal from his face.He hesitated a moment, then he said gravely, "Yes.Don't ask me any
more, Miss Trotter, please.He paused, and then, with a
slight, uneasy glance toward the pine grove, "Don't let me keep you
waiting here any longer."He took her hand, held it lightly for a
moment, and said, "Go, now."Miss Trotter, slightly bewildered and unsatisfied, nevertheless passed
obediently out into the trail.He gazed after her for a moment, and
then turned and began rapidly to ascend the <DW72> where he had first
overtaken her, and was soon out of sight.Miss Trotter continued her way
home; but when she had reached the confines of the wood she turned, as
if taking some sudden resolution, and began slowly to retrace her steps
in the direction of the pine grove.What she expected to see there,
possibly she could not have explained; what she actually saw after a
moment's waiting were the figures of Frida and Mr.Her respected employer wore an air of somewhat ostentatious
importance mingled with rustic gallantry.Frida's manner was also
conscious with gratified vanity; and although they believed themselves
alone, her voice was already pitched into a high key of nervous
affectation, indicative of the peasant.But there was nothing to suggest
that Chris had disturbed them in their privacy and confidences.Yet he
had evidently seen enough to satisfy himself of her faithlessness.Miss Trotter waited only until they had well preceded her, and then took
a shorter cut home.She was quite prepared that evening for an interview
which Mr.She found him awkward and embarrassed in her
cool, self-possessed presence.He said he deemed it his duty to inform
her of his approaching marriage with Miss Jansen; but it was because he
wished distinctly to assure her that it would make no difference in Miss
Trotter's position in the hotel, except to promote her to the entire
control of the establishment.He was to be married in San Francisco at
once, and he and his wife were to go abroad for a year or two; indeed,
he contemplated eventually retiring from business.Bilson
was uneasily conscious during this interview that he had once paid
attentions to Miss Trotter, which she had ignored, she never betrayed
the least recollection of it.She thanked him for his confidence and
wished him happiness.Sudden as was this good fortune to Miss Trotter, an independence she
had so often deservedly looked forward to, she was, nevertheless,
keenly alive to the fact that she had attained it partly through Chris's
disappointment and unhappiness.Her sane mind taught her that it was
better for him; that he had been saved an ill-assorted marriage; that
the girl had virtually rejected him for Bilson before he had asked
her mediation that morning.Yet these reasons failed to satisfy her
feelings.It seemed cruel to her that the interest which she had
suddenly taken in poor Chris should end so ironically in disaster to
her sentiment and success to her material prosperity.She thought of his
boyish appeal to her; of what must have been his utter discomfiture in
the discovery of Frida's relations to Mr.Bilson that afternoon, but
more particularly of the singular change it had effected in him.How
nobly and gently he had taken his loss!How much more like a man he
looked in his defeat than in his passion!The element of respect which
had been wanting in her previous interest in him was now present in her
thoughts.It prevented her seeking him with perfunctory sympathy and
worldly counsel; it made her feel strangely and unaccountably shy of any
other expression.Bilson evidently desired to avoid local gossip until after his
marriage, he had enjoined secrecy upon her, and she was also debarred
from any news of Chris through his brother, who, had he known of Frida's
engagement, would have naturally come to her for explanation.It also
convinced her that Chris himself had not revealed anything to his
brother.III

When the news of the marriage reached Buckeye Hill, it did not, however,
make much scandal, owing, possibly, to the scant number of the sex
who are apt to disseminate it, and to many the name of Miss Jansen was
unknown.Bilson would be absent for a year,
and that the superior control of the Summit Hotel would devolve upon
Miss Trotter, DID, however, create a stir in that practical business
community.Every one knew
that to Miss Trotter's tact and intellect the success of the hotel had
been mainly due.Possibly, the satisfaction of Buckeye Hill was due to
something else.Slowly and insensibly Miss Trotter had achieved a social
distinction; the wives and daughters of the banker, the lawyer, and the
pastor had made much of her, and now, as an independent woman of means,
she stood first in the district.Guests deemed it an honor to have a
personal interview with her.The governor of the State and the Supreme
Court judges treated her like a private hostess; middle-aged Miss
Trotter was considered as eligible a match as the proudest heiress
in California.The old romantic fiction of her past was revived
again,--they had known she was a "real lady" from the first!She
received these attentions, as became her sane intellect and cool
temperament, without pride, affectation, or hesitation.Only her dark
eyes brightened on the day when Mr.Bilson's marriage was made known,
and she was called upon by James Calton."I did you a great injustice," he said, with a smile."I don't understand you," she replied a little coldly."Why, this woman and her marriage," he said; "you must have known
something of it all the time, and perhaps helped it along to save
Chris.""You are mistaken," returned Miss Trotter truthfully."Then I have wronged you still more," he said briskly, "for I thought at
first that you were inclined to help Chris in his foolishness.Now I see
it was your persuasions that changed him.""Let me tell you once for all, Mr.Calton," she returned with an
impulsive heat which she regretted, "that I did not interfere in any way
with your brother's suit.He spoke to me of it, and I promised to see
Frida, but he afterwards asked me not to.Calton, "WHATEVER you did, it was most efficacious,
and you did it so graciously and tactfully that it has not altered
his high opinion of you, if, indeed, he hasn't really transferred his
affections to you."Luckily Miss Trotter had her face turned from him at the beginning of
the sentence, or he would have noticed the quick flush that suddenly
came to her cheek and eyes.Yet for an instant this calm, collected
woman trembled, not at what Mr.Calton might have noticed, but at what
SHE had noticed in HERSELF.Calton, construing her silence and
averted head into some resentment of his familiar speech, continued
hurriedly:--

"I mean, don't you see, that I believe no other woman could have
influenced my brother as you have.""You mean, I think, that he has taken his broken heart very lightly,"
said Miss Trotter, with a bitter little laugh, so unlike herself that
Mr.He's regularly cut up, you
know!More like a gloomy crank than
the easy fool he used to be," he went on, with brotherly directness."It
wouldn't be a bad thing, you know, if you could manage to see him, Miss
Trotter!In fact, as he's off his feed, and has some trouble with his
arm again, owing to all this, I reckon, I've been thinking of advising
him to come up to the hotel once more till he's better.So long as SHE'S
gone it would be all right, you know!"By this time Miss Trotter was herself again.She reasoned, or thought
she did, that this was a question of the business of the hotel, and
it was clearly her duty to assent to Chris's coming.The strange yet
pleasurable timidity which possessed her at the thought she ignored
completely.Luckily, she was so much shocked by the change in
his appearance that it left no room for any other embarrassment in the
meeting.His face had lost its fresh color and round outline; the lines
of his mouth were drawn with pain and accented by his drooping mustache;
his eyes, which had sought hers with a singular seriousness, no longer
wore the look of sympathetic appeal which had once so exasperated her,
but were filled with an older experience.Indeed, he seemed to have
approximated so near to her own age that, by one of those paradoxes of
the emotions, she felt herself much younger, and in smile and eye showed
it; at which he  faintly.But she kept her sympathy and inquiries
limited to his physical health, and made no allusion to his past
experiences; indeed, ignoring any connection between the two.He had
been shockingly careless in his convalescence, had had a relapse in
consequence, and deserved a good scolding!His relapse was a reflection
upon the efficacy of the hotel as a perfect cure!She should treat him
more severely now, and allow him no indulgences!I do not know that
Miss Trotter intended anything covert, but their eyes met and he 
again.Ignoring this also, and promising to look after him occasionally,
she quietly withdrew.But about this time it was noticed that a change took place in Miss
Trotter.Always scrupulously correct, and even severe in her dress, she
allowed herself certain privileges of color, style, and material.She,
who had always affected dark shades and stiff white cuffs and collars,
came out in delicate tints and laces, which lent a brilliancy to her
dark eyes and short crisp black curls, slightly tinged with gray.One warm summer evening she startled every one by appearing in white,
possibly a reminiscence of her youth at the Vermont academy.The
masculine guests thought it pretty and attractive; even the women
forgave her what they believed a natural expression of her prosperity
and new condition, but regretted a taste so inconsistent with her age.For all that, Miss Trotter had never looked so charming, and the faint
autumnal glow in her face made no one regret her passing summer.One evening she found Chris so much better that he was sitting on
the balcony, but still so depressed that she was compelled so far to
overcome the singular timidity she had felt in his presence as to ask
him to come into her own little drawing-room, ostensibly to avoid the
cool night air.It was the former "card-room" of the hotel, but now
fitted with feminine taste and prettiness.She arranged a seat for him
on the sofa, which he took with a certain brusque boyish surliness, the
last vestige of his youth."It's very kind of you to invite me in here," he began bitterly, "when
you are so run after by every one, and to leave Judge Fletcher just
now to talk to me, but I suppose you are simply pitying me for being a
fool!""I thought you were imprudent in exposing yourself to the night air on
the balcony, and I think Judge Fletcher is old enough to take care of
himself," she returned, with the faintest touch of coquetry, and a smile
which was quite as much an amused recognition of that quality in herself
as anything else."And I'm a baby who can't," he said angrily.After a pause he burst out
abruptly: "Miss Trotter, will you answer me one question?""Did you know--that--woman was engaged to Bilson when I spoke to you in
the wood?"she answered quickly, but without the sharp resentment she had
shown at his brother's suggestion.Bilson told
me the same evening.""And I only knew it when news came of their marriage," he said bitterly."But you must have suspected something when you saw them together in the
wood," she responded."When I saw them together in the wood?"Miss Trotter was startled, and stopped short.Was it possible he had not
seen them together?She was shocked that she had spoken; but it was too
late to withdraw her words."Yes," she went on hurriedly, "I thought
that was why you came back to say that I was not to speak to her."He looked at her fixedly, and said slowly: "You thought that?I returned before I had reached the wood--because--because--I had
changed my mind!"I did not love
the girl--I never loved her--I was sick of my folly.Sick of deceiving
you and myself any longer.Now you know why I didn't go into the wood,
and why I didn't care where she was nor who was with her!""I don't understand," she said, lifting her clear eyes to his coldly."Of course you don't," he said bitterly.And when you do understand you will hate and despise me--if you do not
laugh at me for a conceited fool!Hear me out, Miss Trotter, for I am
speaking the truth to you now, if I never spoke it before.I never asked
the girl to marry me!I never said to HER half what I told to YOU, and
when I asked you to intercede with her, I never wanted you to do it--and
never expected you would.""May I ask WHY you did it then?"said Miss Trotter, with an acerbity
which she put on to hide a vague, tantalizing consciousness."You would not believe me if I told you, and you would hate me if you
did."He stopped, and, locking his fingers together, threw his hands
over the back of the sofa and leaned toward her."You never liked me,
Miss Trotter," he said more quietly; "not from the first!From the day
that I was brought to the hotel, when you came to see me, I could see
that you looked upon me as a foolish, petted boy.When I tried to catch
your eye, you looked at the doctor, and took your speech from him.And
yet I thought I had never seen a woman so great and perfect as you were,
and whose sympathy I longed so much to have.You may not believe me, but
I thought you were a queen, for you were the first lady I had ever seen,
and you were so different from the other girls I knew, or the women who
had been kind to me.You may laugh, but it's the truth I'm telling you,
Miss Trotter!"He had relapsed completely into his old pleading, boyish way--it had
struck her even as he had pleaded to her for Frida!"I knew you didn't like me that day you came to change the bandages.Although every touch of your hands seemed to ease my pain, you did it so
coldly and precisely; and although I longed to keep you there with me,
you scarcely waited to take my thanks, but left me as if you had
only done your duty to a stranger.And worst of all," he went on more
bitterly, "the doctor knew it too--guessed how I felt toward you, and
laughed at me for my hopelessness!That made me desperate, and put me up
to act the fool.Yes, Miss Trotter; I thought it mighty clever
to appear to be in love with Frida, and to get him to ask to have her
attend me regularly.And when you simply consented, without a word or
thought about it and me, I knew I was nothing to you."Duchesne's
strange scrutiny of her, of her own mistake, which she now knew might
have been the truth--flashed across her confused consciousness in swift
corroboration of his words.It was a DOUBLE revelation to her; for what
else was the meaning of this subtle, insidious, benumbing sweetness that
was now creeping over her sense and spirit and holding her fast.She
felt she ought to listen no longer--to speak--to say something--to get
up--to turn and confront him coldly--but she was powerless.Her reason
told her that she had been the victim of a trick--that having deceived
her once, he might be doing so again; but she could not break the spell
that was upon her, nor did she want to.She must know the culmination of
this confession, whose preamble thrilled her so strangely."The girl was kind and sympathetic," he went on, "but I was not so great
a fool as not to know that she was a flirt and accustomed to attention.I suppose it was in my desperation that I told my brother, thinking he
would tell you, as he did.He would not tell me what you said to him,
except that you seemed to be indignant at the thought that I was only
flirting with Frida.Then I resolved to speak with you myself--and I
did.I know it was a stupid, clumsy contrivance.It never seemed so
stupid before I spoke to you.It never seemed so wicked as when you
promised to help me, and your eyes shone on me for the first time with
kindness.And it never seemed so hopeless as when I found you touched
with my love for another.You wonder why I kept up this deceit until you
promised.Well, I had prepared the bitter cup myself--I thought I ought
to drink it to the dregs."She turned quietly, passionately, and, standing up, faced him with a
little cry.He rose too, and catching her hands in his, said, with a white face,
"Because I love you."*****

Half an hour later, when the under-housekeeper was summoned to receive
Miss Trotter's orders, she found that lady quietly writing at the table.Among the orders she received was the notification that Mr.Calton's
rooms would be vacated the next day.When the servant, who, like most of
her class, was devoted to the good-natured, good-looking, liberal Chris,
asked with some concern if the young gentleman was no better, Miss
Trotter, with equal placidity, answered that it was his intention to put
himself under the care of a specialist in San Francisco, and that
she, Miss Trotter, fully approved of his course.She finished her
letter,--the servant noticed that it was addressed to Mr.Bilson at
Paris,--and, handing it to her, bade that it should be given to a groom,
with orders to ride over to the Summit post-office at once to catch the
last post.As the housekeeper turned to go, she again referred to the
departing guest."It seems such a pity, ma'am, that Mr.Calton couldn't
stay, as he always said you did him so much good."But when the door closed she gave a hysterical little laugh,
and then, dropping her handsome gray-streaked head in her slim hands,
cried like a girl--or, indeed, as she had never cried when a girl.Calton's departure became known the next day, some
lady guests regretted the loss of this most eligible young bachelor.Miss Trotter agreed with them, with the consoling suggestion that he
might return for a day or two.He did return for a day; it was thought
that the change to San Francisco had greatly benefited him, though some
believed he would be an invalid all his life.Meantime Miss Trotter attended regularly to her duties, with the
difference, perhaps, that she became daily more socially popular and
perhaps less severe in her reception of the attentions of the masculine
guests.It was finally whispered that the great Judge Boompointer was a
serious rival of Judge Fletcher for her hand.When, three months later,
some excitement was caused by the intelligence that Mr.Bilson was
returning to take charge of his hotel, owing to the resignation of Miss
Trotter, who needed a complete change, everybody knew what that meant.A few were ready to name the day when she would become Mrs.Boompointer;
others had seen the engagement ring of Judge Fletcher on her slim
finger.Nevertheless Miss Trotter married neither, and by the time Mr.Bilson had returned she had taken her holiday, and the Summit House knew
her no more.Three years later, and at a foreign Spa, thousands of miles distant from
the scene of her former triumphs, Miss Trotter reappeared as a handsome,
stately, gray-haired stranger, whose aristocratic bearing deeply
impressed a few of her own countrymen who witnessed her arrival, and
believed her to be a grand duchess at the least.They were still
more convinced of her superiority when they saw her welcomed by the
well-known Baroness X., and afterwards engaged in a very confidential
conversation with that lady.But they would have been still more
surprised had they known the tenor of that conversation."I am afraid you will find the Spa very empty just now," said the
baroness critically."But there are a few of your compatriots here,
however, and they are always amusing.You see that somewhat faded blonde
sitting quite alone in that arbor?That is her position day after day,
while her husband openly flirts or is flirted with by half the women
here.Quite the opposite experience one has of American women, where
it's all the other way, is it not?And there is an odd story about her
which may account for, if it does not excuse, her husband's neglect.They're very rich, but they say she was originally a mere servant in a
hotel.""You forget that I told you I was once only a housekeeper in one," said
Miss Trotter, smiling.I mean that this woman was a mere peasant, and frightfully
ignorant at that!"Miss Trotter put up her eyeglass, and, after a moment's scrutiny,
said gently, "I think you are a little severe.That was the name of her FIRST
husband.I am told she was a widow who married again--quite a
fascinating young man, and evidently her superior--that is what is so
funny.said Miss Trotter after a pause, in
a still gentler voice.He has gone on an excursion with a party of ladies to
the Schwartzberg.You will find HER very stupid,
but HE is very jolly, though a little spoiled by women.Miss Trotter smiled, and presently turned the subject.But the baroness
was greatly disappointed to find the next day that an unexpected
telegram had obliged Miss Trotter to leave the Spa without meeting the
Caltons.And yet what matter we do not speak, when the ardent eyes have spoken,
   The way of love is a sweeter way, when the silence is unbroken.As a wayward Fancy, tired at times, of the cultured Damask Rose,
   Drifts away to the tangled copse, where the wild Anemone grows;
   So the ordered and licit love ashore, is hardly fresh and free
   As this light love in the open wind and salt of the outer sea.So sweet you are, with your tinted cheeks and your small caressive hands,
   What if I carried you home with me, where our Golden Temple stands?Yet, this were folly indeed; to bind, in fetters of permanence,
   A passing dream whose enchantment charms because of its trancience.Life is ever a slave to Time; we have but an hour to rest,
   Her steam is up and her lighters leave, the vessel that takes me west;
   And never again we two shall meet, as we chance to meet to-night,
   On the Junk, whose painted eyes gaze forth, in desolate want of sight.And what is love at its best, but this?Conceived by a passing glance,
   Nursed and reared in a transient mood, on a drifting Sea of Chance.For rudderless craft are all our loves, among the rocks and the shoals,
   Well we may know one another's speech, but never each other's souls.Give here your lips and kiss me again, we have but a moment more,
   Before we set the sail to the mast, before we loosen the oar.Good-bye to you, and my thanks to you, for the rest you let me share,
   While this night drifted away to the Past, to join the Nights that Were.Starlight

   O beautiful Stars, when you see me go
     Hither and thither, in search of love,
   Do you think me faithless, who gleam and glow
     Serene and fixed in the blue above?O Stars, so golden, it is not so.But there is a garden I dare not see,
     There is a place where I fear to go,
   Since the charm and glory of life to me
     The brown earth covered there, long ago.O Stars, you saw it, you know, you know.Hither and thither I wandering go,
     With aimless haste and wearying fret;
   In a search for pleasure and love?Not so,
     Seeking desperately to forget.You see so many, O Stars, you know.Sampan Song

   A little breeze blew over the sea,
       And it came from far away,
   Across the fields of millet and rice,
   All warm with sunshine and sweet with spice,
   It lifted his curls and kissed him thrice,
       As upon the deck he lay.It said, "Oh, idle upon the sea,
       Awake and with sleep have done,
   Haul up the widest sail of the prow,
   And come with me to the rice fields now,
   She longs, oh, how can I tell you how,
       To show you your first-born son!"Song of the Devoted Slave

   There is one God: Mahomed his Prophet.Had I his power
   I would take the topmost peaks of the snow-clad Himalayas,
   And would range them around your dwelling, during the heats of summer,
   To cool the airs that fan your serene and delicate presence,
                   Had I the power.Your courtyard should ever be filled with the fleetest of camels
   Laden with inlaid armour, jewels and trappings for horses,
   Ripe dates from Egypt, and spices and musk from Arabia.And the sacred waters of Zem-Zem well, transported thither,
   Should bubble and flow in your chamber, to bathe the delicate
   Slender and wayworn feet of my Lord, returning from travel,
                   Had I the power.Fine woven silk, from the further East, should conceal your beauty,
   Clinging around you in amorous folds; caressive, silken,
   Beautiful long-lashed, sweet-voiced Persian boys should, kneeling, serve you,
   And the floor beneath your sandalled feet should be smooth and golden,
                   Had I the power.And if ever your clear and stately thoughts should turn to women,
   Kings' daughters, maidens, should be appointed to your caresses,
   That the youth and the strength of my Lord might never be wasted
   In light or sterile love; but enrich the world with his children.Whilst I should sit in the outer court of the Water Palace
   To await the time when you went forth, for Pleasure or Warfare,
   Descending the stairs rose crowned, or armed and arrayed in purple,--
   To mark the place where your steps have fallen, and kiss the footprints,
                   Had I the power.The Singer

   The singer only sang the Joy of Life,
     For all too well, alas!the singer knew
   How hard the daily toil, how keen the strife,
     How salt the falling tear; the joys how few.He who thinks hard soon finds it hard to live,
     Learning the Secret Bitterness of Things:
   So, leaving thought, the singer strove to give
     A level lightness to his lyric strings.He only sang of Love; its joy and pain,
     But each man in his early season loves;
   Each finds the old, lost Paradise again,
     Unfolding leaves, and roses, nesting doves.And though that sunlit time flies all too fleetly,
     Delightful Days that dance away too soon!Its early morning freshness lingers sweetly
     Throughout life's grey and tedious afternoon.And he, whose dreams enshrine her tender eyes,
     And she, whose senses wait his waking hand,
   Impatient youth, that tired but sleepless lies,
     Will read perhaps, and reading, understand.Oh, roseate lips he would have loved to kiss,
     Oh, eager lovers that he never knew!What should you know of him, or words of his?--
     But all the songs he sang were sung for you!Malaria

   He lurks among the reeds, beside the marsh,
     Red oleanders twisted in His hair,
   His eyes are haggard and His lips are harsh,
     Upon His breast the bones show gaunt and bare.The green and stagnant waters lick His feet,
     And from their filmy, iridescent scum
   Clouds of mosquitoes, gauzy in the heat,
     Rise with His gifts: Death and Delirium.His messengers: They bear the deadly taint
     On spangled wings aloft and far away,
   Making thin music, strident and yet faint,
     From golden eve to silver break of day.The baffled sleeper hears th' incessant whine
     Through his tormented dreams, and finds no rest
   The thirsty insects use his blood for wine,
     Probe his blue veins and pasture on his breast.While far away He in the marshes lies,
     Staining the stagnant water with His breath,
   An endless hunger burning in His eyes,
     A famine unassuaged, whose food is Death.He hides among the ghostly mists that float
     Over the water, weird and white and chill,
   And peasants, passing in their laden boat,
     Shiver and feel a sense of coming ill.A thousand burn and die; He takes no heed,
     Their bones, unburied, strewn upon the plain,
   Only increase the frenzy of His greed
     To add more victims to th' already slain.He loves the haggard frame, the shattered mind,
     Gloats with delight upon the glazing eye,
   Yet, in one thing, His cruelty is kind,
     He sends them lovely dreams before they die;

   Dreams that bestow on them their heart's desire,
     Visions that find them mad, and leave them blest,
   To sink, forgetful of the fever's fire,
     Softly, as in a lover's arms, to rest.Fancy

   Far in the Further East the skilful craftsman
       Fashioned this fancy for the West's delight.This rose and azure Dragon, crouching softly
       Upon the satin skin, close-grained and white.And you lay silent, while his slender needles
       Pricked the intricate pattern on your arm,
   Combining deftly Cruelty and Beauty,
       That subtle union, whose child is charm.Charm irresistible: the lovely something
       We follow in our dreams, but may not reach.The unattainable Divine Enchantment,
       Hinted in music, never heard in speech.This from the blue design exhales towards me,
       As incense rises from the Homes of Prayer,
   While the unfettered eyes, allured and rested,
       Urge the forbidden lips to stoop and share;

   Share in the sweetness of the rose and azure
       Traced in the Dragon's form upon the white
   Curve of the arm.Ah, curb thyself, my fancy,
       Where would'st thou drift in this enchanted flight?Feroza

   The evening sky was as green as Jade,
      As Emerald turf by Lotus lake,
   Behind the Kafila far she strayed,
      (The Pearls are lost if the Necklace break!)A lingering freshness touched the air
      From palm-trees, clustered around a Spring,
   The great, grim Desert lay vast and bare,
      But Youth is ever a careless thing.The Raiders threw her upon the sand,
      Men of the Wilderness know no laws,
   They tore the Amethysts off her hand,
      And rent the folds of her veiling gauze.They struck the lips that they might have kissed,
      Pitiless they to her pain and fear,
   And wrenched the gold from her broken wrist,
      No use to cry; there were none to hear.Her scarlet mouth and her onyx eyes,
      Her braided hair in its silken sheen,
   Were surely meet for a Lover's prize,
      But Fate dissented, and stepped between.Across the Zenith the vultures fly,
      Cruel of beak and heavy of wing.This Month the Almonds Bloom at Kandahar

   I hate this City, seated on the Plain,
     The clang and clamour of the hot Bazar,
   Knowing, amid the pauses of my pain,
     This month the Almonds bloom in Kandahar.The Almond-trees, that sheltered my Delight,
     Screening my happiness as evening fell.It was well worth--that most Enchanted Night--
     This life in torment, and the next in Hell!People are kind to me; one More than Kind,
     Her lashes lie like fans upon her cheek,
   But kindness is a burden on my mind,
     And it is weariness to hear her speak.For though that Kaffir's bullet holds me here,
     My thoughts are ever free, and wander far,
   To where the Lilac Hills rise, soft and clear,
     Beyond the Almond Groves of Kandahar.He followed me to Sibi, to the Fair,
     The Horse-fair, where he shot me weeks ago,
   But since they fettered him I have no care
     That my returning steps to health are slow.They will not loose him till they know my fate,
     And I rest here till I am strong to slay,
   Meantime, my Heart's Delight may safely wait
     Among the Almond blossoms, sweet as they.Well, he won by day,
     But I won, what I so desired, by night,
   _My_ arms held what his lack till Judgment Day!Also, the game is not yet over--quite!Wait, Amir Ali, wait till I come forth
     To kill, before the Almond-trees are green,
   To raze thy very Memory from the North,
     _So that thou art not, and thou hast not been!_

   Aha!it is Duty
     To rid the World from Shiah dogs like thee,
   They are but ill-placed moles on Islam's beauty,
     Such as the Faithful cannot calmly see!Also thy bullet hurts me not a little,
     Thy Shiah blood might serve to salve the ill.Maybe some Afghan Promises are brittle;
     Never a Promise to oneself, to kill!Now I grow stronger, I have days of leisure
     To shape my coming Vengeance as I lie,
   And, undisturbed by call of War or Pleasure,
     Can dream of many ways a man may die.I shall not torture thee, thy friends might rally,
     Some Fate assist thee and prove false to me;
   Oh!shouldst thou now escape me, Amir Ali,
     This would torment me through Eternity!Aye, Shuffa-Jan, I will be quiet indeed,
     Give here the Hakim's powder if thou wilt,
   And thou mayst sit, for I perceive thy need,
     And rest thy soft-haired head upon my quilt.Thy gentle love will not disturb a mind
     That loves and hates beneath a fiercer Star.Also, thou know'st, my Heart is left behind,
     Among the Almond-trees of Kandahar!End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of India's Love Lyrics, by

/The/ colour of the shadows of an object can never be pure if the body
which is opposed to these shadows be not of the same colour as that on
which they are produced.For instance, if in a room, the walls of which
are green, I place a figure clothed in blue, and receiving the light
from another blue object, the light part of that figure will be of a
beautiful blue, but the shadows of it will become dingy, and not like a
true shade of that beautiful blue, because it will be corrupted by the
reflexions from the green wall; and it would be still worse if the walls
were of a darkish brown.CCXLII./--_Of Colours._


/Colours/ placed in shadow will preserve more or less of their original
beauty, as they are more or less immersed in the shade.But colours
situated in a light space will shew their natural beauty in proportion
to the brightness of that light.Some say, that there is as great
variety in the colours of shadows, as in the colours of objects shaded
by them.It may be answered, that colours placed in shadow will shew
less variety amongst themselves as the shadows are darker.We shall
soon convince ourselves of this truth, if, from a large square, we look
through the open door of a church, where pictures, though enriched with
a variety of colours, appear all clothed in darkness.CCXLIII./--_Whether it be possible for all Colours to
appear alike by means of the same Shadow._


/It/ is very possible that all the different colours may be changed
into that of a general shadow; as is manifest in the darkness of a
cloudy night, in which neither the shape nor colour of bodies is
distinguished.Total darkness being nothing but a privation of the
primitive and reflected lights, by which the form and colour of bodies
are seen; it is evident, that the cause being removed the effect
ceases, and the objects are entirely lost to the sight.CCXLIV./--_Why White is not reckoned among the Colours._


/White/ is not a colour, but has the power of receiving all the other
colours.When it is placed in a high situation in the country, all its
shades are azure; according to the fourth proposition[59], which says,
that the surface of any opake body participates of the colour of any
other body sending the light to it.Therefore white being deprived of
the light of the sun by the interposition of any other body, will remain
white; if exposed to the sun on one side, and to the open air on the
other, it will participate both of the colour of the sun and of the air.That side which is not opposed to the sun, will be shaded of the colour
of the air.And if this white were not surrounded by green fields all
the way to the horizon, nor could receive any light from that horizon,
without doubt it would appear of one simple and uniform colour, viz.CCXLV./--_Of Colours._


/The/ light of the fire tinges every thing of a reddish yellow; but
this will hardly appear evident, if we do not make the comparison with
the daylight.Towards the close of the evening this is easily done; but
more certainly after the morning twilight; and the difference will be
clearly distinguished in a dark room, when a little glimpse of daylight
strikes upon any part of the room, and there still remains a candle
burning.Without such a trial the difference is hardly perceivable,
particularly in those colours which have most similarity; such as white
and yellow, light green and light blue; because the light which strikes
the blue, being yellow, will naturally turn it green; as we have said
in another place[60], that a mixture of blue and yellow produces green.And if to a green colour you add some yellow, it will make it of a more
beautiful green.CCXLVI./--_Of the Colouring of remote Objects._


/The/ painter, who is to represent objects at some distance from the
eye, ought merely to convey the idea of general undetermined masses,
making choice, for that purpose, of cloudy weather, or towards the
evening, and avoiding, as was said before, to mark the lights and
shadows too strong on the extremities; because they would in that
case appear like spots of difficult execution, and without grace.He
ought to remember, that the shadows are never to be of such a quality,
as to obliterate the proper colour, in which they originated; if the
situation of the <DW52> body be not in total darkness.He ought to
mark no outline, not to make the hair stringy, and not to touch with
pure white, any but those things which in themselves are white; in
short, the lightest touch upon any particular object ought to denote
the beauty of its proper and natural colour.CCXLVII./--_The Surface of all opake Bodies participates
of the Colour of the surrounding Objects._


/The/ painter ought to know, that if any white object is placed between
two walls, one of which is also white, and the other black, there will
be found between the shady side of that object and the light side, a
similar proportion to that of the two walls; and if that object be
blue, the effect will be the same.Having therefore to paint this
object, take some black, similar to that of the wall from which the
reflexes come; and to proceed by a certain and scientific method, do as
follows.When you paint the wall, take a small spoon to measure exactly
the quantity of colour you mean to employ in mixing your tints; for
instance, if you have put in the shading of this wall three spoonfuls
of pure black, and one of white, you have, without any doubt, a mixture
of a certain and precise quality.Now having painted one of the walls
white, and the other dark, if you mean to place a blue object between
them with shades suitable to that colour, place first on your pallet
the light blue, such as you mean it to be, without any mixture of
shade, and it will do for the lightest part of your object.After which
take three spoonfuls of black, and one of this light blue, for your
darkest shades.Then observe whether your object be round or square:
if it be square, these two extreme tints of light and shade will be
close to each other, cutting sharply at the angle; but if it be round,
draw lines from the extremities of the walls to the centre of the
object, and put the darkest shade between equal angles, where the lines
intersect upon the superficies of it; then begin to make them lighter
and lighter gradually to the point N O, lessening the strength of the
shadows as much as that place participates of the light A D, and mixing
that colour with the darkest shade A B, in the same proportion.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCXLVIII./--_General Remarks on Colours._


/Blue/ and green are not simple colours in their nature, for blue is
composed of light and darkness; such is the azure of the sky, viz.Green is composed of a simple and a
mixed colour, being produced by blue and yellow.Any object seen in a mirror, will participate of the colour of that
body which serves as a mirror; and the mirror in its turn is tinged in
part by the colour of the object it represents; they partake more or
less of each other as the colour of the object seen is more or less
strong than the colour of the mirror.That object will appear of the
strongest and most lively colour in the mirror, which has the most
affinity to the colour of the mirror itself.Of  bodies, the purest white will be seen at the greatest
distance, therefore the darker the colour, the less it will bear
distance.Of different bodies equal in whiteness, and in distance from the eye,
that which is surrounded by the greatest darkness will appear the
whitest; and on the contrary, that shadow will appear the darkest that
has the brightest white round it.Of different colours, equally perfect, that will appear most excellent,
which is seen near its direct contrary.A pale colour against red, a
black upon white (though neither the one nor the other are colours),
blue near a yellow; green near red; because each colour is more
distinctly seen, when opposed to its contrary, than to any other
similar to it.Any thing white seen in a dense air full of vapours, will appear larger
than it is in reality.The air, between the eye and the object seen, will change the colour
of that object into its own; so will the azure of the air change the
distant mountains into blue masses.Through a red glass every thing
appears red; the light round the stars is dimmed by the darkness of the
air, which fills the space between the eye and the planets.The true colour of any object whatever will be seen in those parts
which are not occupied by any kind of shade, and have not any gloss (if
it be a polished surface).I say, that white terminating abruptly upon a dark ground, will cause
that part where it terminates to appear darker, and the white whiter.COLOURS IN REGARD TO LIGHT AND SHADOW.CCXLIX./--_Of the Light proper for painting Flesh Colour from
Nature._


/Your/ window must be open to the sky, and the walls painted of a
reddish colour.The summertime is the best, when the clouds conceal the
sun, or else your walls on the south side of the room must be so high,
as that the sun-beams cannot strike on the opposite side, in order
that the reflexion of those beams may not destroy the shadows.CCL./--_Of the Painter's Window._


/The/ window which gives light to a painting-room, ought to be made of
oiled paper, without any cross bar, or projecting edge at the opening,
or any sharp angle in the inside of the wall, but should be slanting by
degrees the whole thickness of it; and the sides be painted black.CCLI./--_The Shadows of Colours._


/The/ shadows of any colour whatever must participate of that colour
more or less, as it is nearer to, or more remote from the mass of
shadows; and also in proportion to its distance from, or proximity to
the mass of light.CCLII./--_Of the Shadows of White._


/To/ any white body receiving the light from the sun, or the air, the
shadows should be of a blueish cast; because white is no colour, but a
receiver of all colours; and as by the fourth proposition[61] we learn,
that the surface of any object participates of the colours of other
objects near it, it is evident that a white surface will participate of
the colour of the air by which it is surrounded.CCLIII./--_Which of the Colours will produce the darkest Shade._


/That/ shade will be the darkest which is produced by the whitest
surface; this also will have a greater propensity to variety than any
other surface; because white is not properly a colour, but a receiver
of colours, and its surface will participate strongly of the colour of
surrounding objects, but principally of black or any other dark colour,
which being the most opposite to its nature, produces the most sensible
difference between the shadows and the lights.CCLIV./--_How to manage, when a White terminates upon another
White._


/When/ one white body terminates on another of the same colour, the
white of these two bodies will be either alike or not.If they be
alike, that object which of the two is nearest to the eye, should be
made a little darker than the other, upon the rounding of the outline;
but if the object which serves as a ground to the other be not quite so
white, the latter will detach of itself, without the help of any darker
termination.CCLV./--_On the Back-grounds of Figures._


/Of/ two objects equally light, one will appear less so if seen upon
a whiter ground; and, on the contrary, it will appear a great deal
lighter if upon a space of a darker shade.So flesh colour will appear
pale upon a red ground, and a pale colour will appear redder upon
a yellow ground.In short, colours will appear what they are not,
according to the ground which surrounds them.CCLVI./--_The Mode of composing History._


/Amongst/ the figures which compose an historical picture, those which
are meant to appear the nearest to the eye, must have the greatest
force; according to the second proposition[62] of the third book, which
says, that colour will be seen in the greatest perfection which has
less air interposed between it and the eye of the beholder; and for
that reason the shadows (by which we express the relievo of bodies)
appear darker when near than when at a distance, being then deadened by
the air which interposes.This does not happen to those shadows which
are near the eye, where they will produce the greatest relievo when
they are darkest.CCLVII./--_Remarks concerning Lights and Shadows._


/Observe/, that where the shadows end, there be always a kind of
half-shadow to blend them with the lights.The shadow derived from any
object will mix more with the light at its termination, in proportion
as it is more distant from that object.But the colour of the shadow
will never be simple: this is proved by the ninth proposition[63],
which says, that the superficies of any object participates of the
colours of other bodies, by which it is surrounded, although it were
transparent, such as water, air, and the like: because the air receives
its light from the sun, and darkness is produced by the privation of
it.But as the air has no colour in itself any more than water, it
receives all the colours that are between the object and the eye.The
vapours mixing with the air in the lower regions near the earth, render
it thick, and apt to reflect the sun's rays on all sides, while the air
above remains dark; and because light (that is, white) and darkness
(that is, black), mixed together, compose the azure that becomes the
colour of the sky, which is lighter or darker in proportion as the air
is more or less mixed with damp vapours.CCLVIII./--_Why the Shadows of Bodies upon a white Wall are
blueish towards Evening._


[Illustration]

/The/ shadows of bodies produced by the redness of the setting
sun, will always be blueish.This is accounted for by the eleventh
proposition[64], which says, that the superficies of any opake body
participates of the colour of the object from which it receives the
light; therefore the white wall being deprived entirely of colour, is
tinged by the colour of those bodies from which it receives the light,
which in this case are the sun and the sky.But because the sun is red
towards the evening, and the sky is blue, the shadow on the wall not
being enlightened by the sun, receives only the reflexion of the sky,
and therefore will appear blue; and the rest of the wall, receiving
light immediately from the sun, will participate of its red colour.CCLIX./--_Of the Colour of Faces._


/The/ colour of any object will appear more or less distinct in
proportion to the extent of its surface.This proportion is proved, by
observing that a face appears dark at a small distance, because, being
composed of many small parts, it produces a great number of shadows;
and the lights being the smallest part of it, are soonest lost to the
sight, leaving only the shadows, which being in a greater quantity, the
whole of the face appears dark, and the more so if that face has on the
head, or at the back, something whiter.CCLX./--_A Precept relating to Painting._


/Where/ the shadows terminate upon the lights, observe well what parts
of them are lighter than the others, and where they are more or less
softened and blended; but above all remember, that young people have
no sharp shadings: their flesh is transparent, something like what
we observe when we put our hand between the sun and eyes; it appears
reddish, and of a transparent brightness.If you wish to know what
kind of shadow will suit the flesh colour you are painting, place one
of your fingers close to your picture, so as to cast a shadow upon it,
and according as you wish it either lighter or darker, put it nearer or
farther from it, and imitate it.CCLXI./--_Of Colours in Shadow._


/It/ happens very often that the shadows of an opake body do not retain
the same colour as the lights.Sometimes they will be greenish, while
the lights are reddish, although this opake body be all over of one
uniform colour.This happens when the light falls upon the object (we
will suppose from the East), and tinges that side with its own colour.In the West we will suppose another opake body of a colour different
from the first, but receiving the same light.This last will reflect
its colour towards the East, and strike the first with its rays on the
opposite side, where they will be stopped, and remain with their full
colour and brightness.We often see a white object with red lights, and
the shades of a blueish cast; this we observe particularly in mountains
covered with snow, at sun-set, when the effulgence of its rays makes
the horizon appear all on fire.CCLXII./--_Of the Choice of Lights._


/Whatever/ object you intend to represent is to be supposed situated
in a particular light, and that entirely of your own choosing.If you
imagine such objects to be in the country, and the sun be overcast,
they will be surrounded by a great quantity of general light.If the
sun strikes upon those objects, then the shadows will be very dark,
in proportion to the lights, and will be determined and sharp; the
primitive as well as the secondary ones.These shadows will vary from
the lights in colour, because on that side the object receives a
reflected light hue from the azure of the air, which tinges that part;
and this is particularly observable in white objects.That side which
receives the light from the sun, participates also of the colour of
that.This may be particularly observed in the evening, when the sun
is setting between the clouds, which it reddens; those clouds being
tinged with the colour of the body illuminating them, the red colour
of the clouds, with that of the sun, casts a hue on those parts which
receive the light from them.On the contrary, those parts which are not
turned towards that side of the sky, remain of the colour of the air,
so that the former and the latter are of two different colours.This
we must not lose sight of, that, knowing the cause of those lights and
shades, it be made apparent in the effect, or else the work will be
false and absurd.But if a figure be situated within a house, and seen
from without, such figure will have its shadows very soft; and if the
beholder stands in the line of the light, it will acquire grace, and do
credit to the painter, as it will have great relief in the lights, and
soft and well-blended shadows, particularly in those parts where the
inside of the room appears less obscure, because there the shadows are
almost imperceptible: the cause of which we shall explain in its proper
place.COLOURS IN REGARD TO BACK-GROUNDS.CCLXIII./--_Of avoiding hard Outlines._


/Do/ not make the boundaries of your figures with any other colour
than that of the back-ground, on which they are placed; that is, avoid
making dark outlines.CCLXIV./--_Of Outlines._


/The/ extremities of objects which are at some distance, are not seen
so distinctly as if they were nearer.Therefore the painter ought to
regulate the strength of his outlines, or extremities, according to the
distance.The boundaries which separate one body from another, are of the nature
of mathematical lines, but not of real lines.The end of any colour
is only the beginning of another, and it ought not to be called a
line, for nothing interposes between them, except the termination of
the one against the other, which being nothing in itself, cannot be
perceivable; therefore the painter ought not to pronounce it in distant
objects.CCLXV./--_Of Back-grounds._


/One/ of the principal parts of painting is the nature and quality of
back-grounds, upon which the extremities of any convex or solid body
will always detach and be distinguished in nature, though the colour
of such objects, and that of the ground, be exactly the same.This
happens, because the convex sides of solid bodies do not receive the
light in the same manner with the ground, for such sides or extremities
are often lighter or darker than the ground.But if such extremities
were to be of the same colour as the ground, and in the same degree
of light, they certainly could not be distinguished.Therefore such a
choice in painting ought to be avoided by all intelligent and judicious
painters; since the intention is to make the objects appear as it were
out of the ground.The above case would produce the contrary effect,
not only in painting, but also in objects of real relievo.CCLXVI./--_How to detach Figures from the Ground._


/All/ solid bodies will appear to have a greater relief, and to come
more out of the canvass, on a ground of an undetermined colour, with
the greatest variety of lights and shades against the confines of
such bodies (as will be demonstrated in its place), provided a proper
diminution of lights in the white tints, and of darkness in the shades,
be judiciously observed.CCLXVII./--_Of Uniformity and Variety of Colours upon plain
Surfaces._


/The/ back-grounds of any flat surfaces which are uniform in colour and
quantity of light, will never appear separated from each other; _vice
versa_, they will appear separated if they are of different colours or
lights.CCLXVIII./--_Of Back-grounds suitable both to Shadows and
Lights._


/The/ shadows or lights which surround figures, or any other objects,
will help the more to detach them the more they differ from the
objects; that is, if a dark colour does not terminate upon another dark
colour, but upon a very different one; as white, or partaking of white,
but lowered, and approximated to the dark shade.CCLXIX./--_The apparent Variation of Colours, occasioned by the
Contraste of the Ground upon which they are placed._


/No/ colour appears uniform and equal in all its parts unless it
terminate on a ground of the same colour.This is very apparent when a
black terminates on a white ground, where the contraste of colour gives
more strength and richness to the extremities than to the middle.CONTRASTE, HARMONY, AND REFLEXES, IN REGARD TO COLOURS.CCLXX./--_Gradation in Painting._


/What/ is fine is not always beautiful and good: I address this to
such painters as are so attached to the beauty of colours, that they
regret being obliged to give them almost imperceptible shadows, not
considering the beautiful relief which figures acquire by a proper
gradation and strength of shadows.Such persons may be compared to
those speakers who in conversation make use of many fine words without
meaning, which altogether scarcely form one good sentence.CCLXXI./--_How to assort Colours in such a Manner as that they
may add Beauty to each other._


/If/ you mean that the proximity of one colour should give beauty to
another that terminates near it, observe the rays of the sun in the
composition of the rainbow, the colours of which are generated by the
falling rain, when each drop in its descent takes every colour of that
bow, as is demonstrated in its place[65].If you mean to represent great darkness, it must be done by contrasting
it with great light; on the contrary, if you want to produce great
brightness, you must oppose to it a very dark shade: so a pale yellow
will cause red to appear more beautiful than if opposed to a purple
colour.There is another rule, by observing which, though you do not increase
the natural beauty of the colours, yet by bringing them together they
may give additional grace to each other, as green placed near red,
while the effect would be quite the reverse, if placed near blue.Harmony and grace are also produced by a judicious arrangement of
colours, such as blue with pale yellow or white, and the like; as will
be noticed in its place.CCLXXII./--_Of detaching the Figures._


/Let/ the colours of which the draperies of your figures are composed,
be such as to form a pleasing variety, to distinguish one from the
other; and although, for the sake of harmony, they should be of the
same nature[66], they must not stick together, but vary in point of
light, according to the distance and interposition of the air between
them.By the same rule, the outlines are to be more precise, or lost,
in proportion to their distance or proximity.CCLXXIII./--_Of the Colour of Reflexes._


/All/ reflected colours are less brilliant and strong, than those which
receive a direct light, in the same proportion as there is between the
light of a body and the cause of that light.CCLXXIV./--_What Body will be the most strongly tinged with the
Colour of any other Object._


/An/ opake surface will partake most of the genuine colour of the body
nearest to it, because a great quantity of the species of colour will
be conveyed to it; whereas such colour would be broken and disturbed if
coming from a more distant object.CCLXXV./--_Of Reflexes._


/Reflexes/ will partake, more or less, both of the colour of the object
which produces them, and of the colour of that object on which they are
produced, in proportion as this latter body is of a smoother or more
polished surface, than that by which they are produced.CCLXXVI./--_Of the Surface of all shadowed Bodies._


/The/ surface of any opake body placed in shadow, will participate of
the colour of any other object which reflects the light upon it.This
is very evident; for if such bodies were deprived of light in the space
between them and the other bodies, they could not shew either shape or
colour.We shall conclude then, that if the opake body be yellow, and
that which reflects the light blue, the part reflected will be green,
because green is composed of blue and yellow.CCLXXVII./--_That no reflected Colour is simple, but is mixed
with the Nature of the other Colours._


/No/ colour reflected upon the surface of another body, will tinge that
surface with its own colour alone, but will be mixed by the concurrence
of other colours also reflected on the same spot.Let us suppose A to
be of a yellow colour, which is reflected on the convex C O E, and that
the blue colour B be reflected on the same place.I say that a mixture
of the blue and yellow colours will tinge the convex surface; and that,
if the ground be white, it will produce a green reflexion, because it
is proved that a mixture of blue and yellow produces a very fine green.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCLXXVIII./--_Of the Colour of Lights and Reflexes._


/When/ two lights strike upon an opake body, they can vary only in
two ways; either they are equal in strength, or they are not.If
they be equal, they may still vary in two other ways, that is, by
the equality or inequality of their brightness; they will be equal,
if their distance be the same; and unequal, if it be otherwise.The
object placed at an equal distance, between two equal lights, in point
both of colour and brightness, may still be enlightened by them in two
different ways, either equally on each side, or unequally.It will be
equally enlightened by them, when the space which remains round the
lights shall be equal in colour, in degree of shade, and in brightness.It will be unequally enlightened by them when the spaces happen to be
of different degrees of darkness.CCLXXIX./--_Why reflected Colours seldom partake of the Colour
of the Body where they meet._


/It/ happens very seldom that the reflexes are of the same colour with
the body from which they proceed, or with that upon which they meet.To exemplify this, let the convex body D F G E be of a yellow colour,
and the body B C, which reflects its colour on it, blue; the part of
the convex surface which is struck by that reflected light, will take
a green tinge, being B C, acted on by the natural light of the air, or
the sun.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCLXXX./--_The Reflexes of Flesh Colours._


/The/ lights upon the flesh colours, which are reflected by the light
striking upon another flesh-<DW52> body, are redder and more lively
than any other part of the human figure; and that happens according
to the third proposition of the second book[67], which says, the
surface of any opake body participates of the colour of the object
which reflects the light, in proportion as it is near to or remote
from it, and also in proportion to the size of it; because, being
large, it prevents the variety of colours in smaller objects round it,
from interfering with, and discomposing the principal colour, which
is nearer.Nevertheless it does not prevent its participating more of
the colour of a small object near it, than of a large one more remote.See the sixth proposition[68] of perspective, which says, that large
objects may be situated at such a distance as to appear less than small
ones that are near.CCLXXXI./--_Of the Nature of Comparison._


/Black/ draperies will make the flesh of the human figure appear whiter
than in reality it is[69]; and white draperies, on the contrary, will
make it appear darker.Yellow will render it higher, while red
will make it pale.CCLXXXII./--_Where the Reflexes are seen._


/Of/ all reflexions of the same shape, size, and strength, that will be
more or less strong, which terminates on a ground more or less dark.The surface of those bodies will partake most of the colour of the
object that reflects it, which receive that reflexion by the most
nearly equal angles.Of the colours of objects reflected upon any opposite surface by equal
angles, that will be the most distinct which has its reflecting ray the
shortest.Of all colours, reflected under equal angles, and at equal distance
upon the opposite body, those will be the strongest, which come
reflected by the lightest <DW52> body.That object will reflect its own colour most precisely on the opposite
object, which has not round it any colour that clashes with its own;
and consequently that reflected colour will be most confused which
takes its origin from a variety of bodies of different colours.That colour which is nearest the opposed object, will tinge it the most
strongly; and _vice versa_: let the painter, therefore, in his reflexes
on the human body, particularly on the flesh colour, mix some of the
colour of the drapery which comes nearest to it; but not pronounce it
too distinctly, if there be not good reason for it.CCLXXXIII./--_A Precept of Perspective in regard to Painting._


/When/, on account of some particular quality of the air, you can no
longer distinguish the difference between the lights and shadows of
objects, you may reject the perspective of shadows, and make use only
of the linear perspective, and the diminution of colours, to lessen the
knowledge of the objects opposed to the eye; and this, that is to say,
the loss of the knowledge of the figure of each object, will make the
same object appear more remote.The eye can never arrive at a perfect knowledge of the interval between
two objects variously distant, by means of the linear perspective
alone, if not assisted by the perspective of colours.CCLXXXIV./--_Of the Perspective of Colours._


/The/ air will participate less of the azure of the sky, in proportion
as it comes nearer to the horizon, as it is proved by the third and
ninth proposition[70], that pure and subtile bodies (such as compose
the air) will be less illuminated by the sun than those of thicker and
grosser substance: and as it is certain that the air which is remote
from the earth, is thinner than that which is near it, it will follow,
that the latter will be more impregnated with the rays of the sun,
which giving light at the same time to an infinity of atoms floating
in this air, renders it more sensible to the eye.So that the air will
appear lighter towards the horizon, and darker as well as bluer in
looking up to the sky; because there is more of the thick air between
our eyes and the horizon, than between our eyes and that part of the
sky above our heads.[Illustration]

For instance: if the eye placed in P, looks through the air along the
line P R, and then lowers itself a little along P S, the air will begin
to appear a little whiter, because there is more of the thick air in
this space than in the first.And if it be still removed lower, so
as to look straight at the horizon, no more of that blue sky will be
perceived which was observable along the first line P R, because there
is a much greater quantity of thick air along the horizontal line P D,
than along the oblique P S, or the perpendicular P R.CCLXXXV./--_The Cause of the Diminution of Colours._


/The/ natural colour of any visible object will be diminished in
proportion to the density of any other substance which interposes
between that object and the eye.CCLXXXVI./--_Of the Diminution of Colours and Objects._


/Let/ the colours vanish in proportion as the objects diminish in size,
according to the distance.CCLXXXVII./--_Of the Variety observable in Colours, according to
their Distance, or Proximity._


/The/ local colour of such objects as are darker than the air, will
appear less dark as they are more remote; and, on the contrary, objects
lighter than the air will lose their brightness in proportion to their
distance from the eye.In general, all objects that are darker or
lighter than the air, are discoloured by distance, which changes their
quality, so that the lighter appears darker, and the darker lighter.CCLXXXVIII./--_At what Distance Colours are entirely lost._


/Local/ colours are entirely lost at a greater or less distance,
according as the eye and the object are more or less elevated from the
earth.This is proved by the seventh proposition[71], which says, the
air is more or less pure, as it is near to, or remote from the earth.If the eye then, and the object are near the earth, the thickness of
the air which interposes, will in a great measure confuse the colour of
that object to the eye.But if the eye and the object are placed high
above the earth, the air will disturb the natural colour of that object
very little.In short, the various gradations of colour depend not only
on the various distances, in which they may be lost; but also on the
variety of lights, which change according to the different hours of the
day, and the thickness or purity of the air, through which the colour
of the object is conveyed to the eye.CCLXXXIX./--_Of the Change observable in the same Colour,
according to its Distance from the Eye._


/Among/ several colours of the same nature, that which is the nearest
to the eye will alter the least; because the air which interposes
between the eye and the object seen, envelopes, in some measure, that
object.If the air, which interposes, be in great quantity, the object
seen will be strongly tinged with the colour of that air; but if the
air be thin, then the view of that object, and its colour, will be very
little obstructed.CCXC./--_Of the blueish Appearance of remote Objects in a
Landscape._


/Whatever/ be the colour of distant objects, the darkest, whether
natural or accidental, will appear the most tinged with azure.By
the natural darkness is meant the proper colour of the object; the
accidental one is produced by the shadow of some other body.CCXCI./--_Of the Qualities in the Surface which first lose
themselves by Distance._


/The/ first part of any colour which is lost by the distance, is the
gloss, being the smallest part of it, as a light within a light.The
second that diminishes by being farther removed, is the light, because
it is less in quantity than the shadow.The third is the principal
shadows, nothing remaining at last but a kind of middling obscurity.CCXCII./--_From what Cause the Azure of the Air proceeds._


/The/ azure of the sky is produced by the transparent body of the
air, illumined by the sun, and interposed between the darkness of the
expanse above, and the earth below.The air in itself has no quality
of smell, taste, or colour, but is easily impregnated with the quality
of other matter surrounding it; and will appear bluer in proportion to
the darkness of the space behind it, as may be observed against the
shady sides of mountains, which are darker than any other object.In
this instance the air appears of the most beautiful azure, while on the
other side that receives the light, it shews through that more of the
natural colour of the mountain.CCXCIII./--_Of the Perspective of Colours._


/The/ same colour being placed at various distances and equal
elevation, the force and effect of its colouring will be according
to the proportion of the distance which there is from each of these
colours to the eye.It is proved thus: let C B E D be one and the same
colour.The first, E, is placed at two degrees of distance from the eye
A; the second, B, shall be four degrees, the third, C, six degrees,
and the fourth, D, eight degrees; as appears by the circles which
terminate upon and intersect the line A R. Let us suppose that the
space A R, S P, is one degree of thin air, and S P E T another degree
of thicker air.It will follow, that the first colour, E, will pass
to the eye through one degree of thick air, E S, and through another
degree, S A, of thinner air.And B will send its colour to the eye in
A, through two degrees of thick air, and through two others of the
thinner sort.C will send it through three degrees of the thin, and
three of the thick sort, while D goes through four degrees of the one,
and four of the other.This demonstrates, that the gradation of colours
is in proportion to their distance from the eye[72].But this happens
only to those colours which are on a level with the eye; as for those
which happen to be at unequal elevations, we cannot observe the same
rule, because they are in that case situated in different qualities of
air, which alter and diminish these colours in various manners.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCXCIV./--_Of the Perspective of Colours in dark Places._


/In/ any place where the light diminishes in a gradual proportion till
it terminates in total darkness, the colours also will lose themselves
and be dissolved in proportion as they recede from the eye.CCXCV./--_Of the Perspective of Colours._


/The/ principal colours, or those nearest to the eye, should be pure
and simple; and the degree of their diminution should be in proportion
to their distance, viz.the nearer they are to the principal point, the
more they will possess of the purity of those colours, and they will
partake of the colour of the horizon in proportion as they approach to
it.CCXCVI./--_Of Colours._


/Of/ all the colours which are not blue, those that are nearest to
black will, when distant, partake most of the azure; and, on the
contrary, those will preserve their proper colour at the greatest
distance, that are most dissimilar to black.The green therefore of the fields will change sooner into blue than
yellow, or white, which will preserve their natural colour at a greater
distance than that, or even red.CCXCVII./--_How it happens that Colours do not change, though
placed in different Qualities of Air._


/The/ colour will not be subject to any alteration when the distance
and the quality of air have a reciprocal proportion.What it loses by
the distance it regains by the purity of the air, viz.if we suppose
the first or lowest air to have four degrees of thickness, and the
colour to be at one degree from the eye, and the second air above to
have three degrees.The air having lost one degree of thickness, the
colour will acquire one degree upon the distance.And when the air
still higher shall have lost two degrees of thickness, the colour will
acquire as many upon the distance; and in that case the colour will be
the same at three degrees as at one.But to be brief, if the colour be
raised so high as to enter that quality of air which has lost three
degrees of thickness, and acquired three degrees of distance, then you
may be certain that that colour which is high and remote, has lost
no more than the colour which is below and nearer; because in rising
it has acquired those three degrees which it was losing by the same
distance from the eye; and this is what was meant to be proved.CCXCVIII./--_Why Colours experience no apparent Change, though
placed in different Qualities of Air._


[Illustration]

/It/ may happen that a colour does not alter, though placed at
different distances, when the thickness of the air and the distance
are in the same inverse proportion.It is proved thus: let A be the
eye, and H any colour whatever, placed at one degree of distance
from the eye, in a quality of air of four degrees of thickness; but
because the second degree above, A M N L, contains a thinner air by
one half, which air conveys this colour, it follows that this colour
will appear as if removed double the distance it was at before, viz.at two degrees of distance, A F and F G, from the eye; and it will be
placed in G. If that is raised to the second degree of air A M N L, and
to the degree O M, P N, it will necessarily be placed at E, and will
be removed from the eye the whole length of the line A E, which will
be proved in this manner to be equal in thickness to the distance A G.
If in the same quality of air the distance A G interposed between the
eye and the colour occupies two degrees, and A E occupies two degrees
and a half, it is sufficient to preserve the colour G, when raised to
E, from any change, because the degree A C and the degree A F being
the same in thickness, are equal and alike, and the degree C D, though
equal in length to the degree F G, is not alike in point of thickness
of air; because half of it is situated in a degree of air of double the
thickness of the air above: this half degree of distance occupies as
much of the colour as one whole degree of the air above would, which
air above is twice as thin as the air below, with which it terminates;
so that by calculating the thickness of the air, and the distances,
you will find that the colours have changed places without undergoing
any alteration in their beauty.And we shall prove it thus: reckoning
first the thickness of air, the colour H is placed in four degrees of
thickness, the colour G in two degrees, and E at one degree.Now let
us see whether the distances are in an equal inverse proportion; the
colour E is at two degrees and a half of distance, G at two degrees,
and H at one degree.But as this distance has not an exact proportion
with the thickness of air, it is necessary to make a third calculation
in this manner: A C is perfectly like and equal to A F; the half
degree, C B, is like but not equal to A F, because it is only half a
degree in length, which is equal to a whole degree of the quality of
the air above; so that by this calculation we shall solve the question.For A C is equal to two degrees of thickness of the air above, and the
half degree C B is equal to a whole degree of the same air above; and
one degree more is to be taken in, viz.A H has four degrees of thickness of air, A G also four, viz.A F two
in value, and F G also two, which taken together make four.A E has
also four, because A C contains two, and C D one, which is the half
of A C, and in the same quality of air; and there is a whole degree
above in the thin air, which all together make four.So that if A E is
not double the distance A G, nor four times the distance A H, it is
made equivalent by the half degree C B of thick air, which is equal
to a whole degree of thin air above.This proves the truth of the
proposition, that the colour H G E does not undergo any alteration by
these different distances.CCXCIX./--_Contrary Opinions in regard to Objects seen afar off._


/Many/ painters will represent the objects darker, in proportion as
they are removed from the eye; but this cannot be true, unless the
objects seen be white; as shall be examined in the next chapter.CCC./--_Of the Colour of Objects remote from the Eye._


/The/ air tinges objects with its own colour more or less in proportion
to the quantity of intervening air between it and the eye, so that a
dark object at the distance of two miles (or a density of air equal to
such distance), will be more tinged with its colour than if only one
mile distant.It is said, that, in a landscape, trees of the same species appear
darker in the distance than near; this cannot be true, if they be of
equal size, and divided by equal spaces.But it will be so if the
first trees are scattered, and the light of the fields is seen through
and between them, while the others which are farther off, are thick
together, as is often the case near some river or other piece of water:
in this case no space of light fields can be perceived, but the trees
appear thick together, accumulating the shadow on each other.It also
happens, that as the shady parts of plants are much broader than the
light ones, the colour of the plants becoming darker by the multiplied
shadows, is preserved, and conveyed to the eye more strongly than that
of the other parts; these masses, therefore, will carry the strongest
parts of their colour to a greater distance.CCCI./--_Of the Colour of Mountains._


/The/ darker the mountain is in itself, the bluer it will appear at a
great distance.The highest part will be the darkest, as being more
woody; because woods cover a great many shrubs, and other plants,
which never receive any light.The wild plants of those woods are also
naturally of a darker hue than cultivated plants; for oak, beech, fir,
cypress, and pine trees are much darker than olive and other domestic
plants.Near the top of these mountains, where the air is thinner and
purer, the darkness of the woods will make it appear of a deeper azure,
than at the bottom, where the air is thicker.A plant will detach very
little from the ground it stands upon, if that ground be of a colour
something similar to its own; and, _vice versa_, that part of any white
object which is nearest to a dark one, will appear the whitest, and
the less so as it is removed from it; and any dark object will appear
darker, the nearer it is to a white one; and less so, if removed from
it.CCCII./--_Why the Colour and Shape of Objects are lost in some
Situations apparently dark, though not so in Reality._


/There/ are some situations which, though light, appear dark, and in
which objects are deprived both of form and colour.This is caused by
the great light which pervades the intervening air; as is observable by
looking in through a window at some distance from the eye, when nothing
is seen but an uniform darkish shade; but if we enter the house, we
shall find that room to be full of light, and soon distinguish every
small object contained within that window.This difference of effect
is produced by the great brightness of the air, which contracts
considerably the pupil of the eye, and by so doing diminishes its
power.But in dark places the pupil is enlarged, and acquires as much
in strength, as it increases in size.This is proved in my second
proposition of perspective[73].CCCIII./--_Various Precepts in Painting._


/The/ termination and shape of the parts in general are very little
seen, either in great masses of light, or of shadows; but those which
are situated between the extremes of light and shade are the most
distinct.Perspective, as far as it extends in regard to painting, is divided
into three principal parts; the first consists in the diminution of
size, according to distance; the second concerns the diminution of
colours in such objects; and the third treats of the diminution of the
perception altogether of those objects, and of the degree of precision
they ought to exhibit at various distances.The azure of the sky is produced by a mixture composed of light and
darkness[74]; I say of light, because of the moist particles floating
in the air, which reflect the light.By darkness, I mean the pure air,
which has none of these extraneous particles to stop and reflect the
rays.Of this we see an example in the air interposed between the eye
and some dark mountains, rendered so by the shadows of an innumerable
quantity of trees; or else shaded on one side by the natural privation
of the rays of the sun; this air becomes azure, but not so on the side
of the mountain which is light, particularly when it is covered with
snow.Among objects of equal darkness and equal distance, those will appear
darker that terminate upon a lighter ground, and _vice versa_[75].That object which is painted with the most white and the most black,
will shew greater relief than any other; for that reason I would
recommend to painters to colour and dress their figures with the
brightest and most lively colours; for if they are painted of a dull
or obscure colour, they will detach but little, and not be much seen,
when the picture is placed at some distance; because the colour of
every object is obscured in the shades; and if it be represented as
originally so all over, there will be but little difference between
the lights and the shades, while lively colours will shew a striking
difference.CCCIV./--_Aerial Perspective._


/There/ is another kind of perspective called aerial, because by the
difference of the air it is easy to determine the distance of different
objects, though seen on the same line; such, for instance, as buildings
behind a wall, and appearing all of the same height above it.If in
your picture you want to have one appear more distant than another, you
must first suppose the air somewhat thick, because, as we have said
before, in such a kind of air the objects seen at a great distance,
as mountains are, appear blueish like the air, by means of the great
quantity of air that interposes between the eye and such mountains.You will then paint the first building behind that wall of its proper
colour; the next in point of distance, less distinct in the outline,
and participating, in a greater degree, of the blueish colour of the
air; another which you wish to send off as much farther, should be
painted as much bluer; and if you wish one of them to appear five times
farther removed beyond the wall, it must have five times more of the
azure.By this rule these buildings which appeared all of the same
size, and upon the same line, will be distinctly perceived to be of
different dimensions, and at different distances.CCCV./--_The Parts of the Smallest Objects will first disappear
in Painting._


/Of/ objects receding from the eye the smallest will be the first lost
to the sight; from which it follows, that the largest will be the last
to disappear.The painter, therefore, ought not to finish the parts of
those objects which are very far off, but follow the rule given in the
sixth book[76].How many, in the representation of towns, and other objects remote
from the eye, express every part of the buildings in the same manner
as if they were very near.It is not so in nature, because there is no
sight so powerful as to perceive distinctly at any great distance the
precise form of parts or extremities of objects.The painter therefore
who pronounces the outlines, and the minute distinction of parts, as
several have done, will not give the representation of distant objects,
but by this error will make them appear exceedingly near.Again, the
angles of buildings in distant towns are not to be expressed (for they
cannot be seen), considering that angles are formed by the concurrence
of two lines into one point, and that a point has no parts; it is
therefore invisible.CCCVI./--_Small Figures ought not to be too much finished._


/Objects/ appear smaller than they really are when they are distant
from the eye, and because there is a great deal of air interposed,
which weakens the appearance of forms, and, by a natural consequence,
prevents our seeing distinctly the minute parts of such objects.It
behoves the painter therefore to touch those parts slightly, in an
unfinished manner; otherwise it would be against the effect of Nature,
whom he has chosen for his guide.For, as we said before, objects
appear small on account of their great distance from the eye; that
distance includes a great quantity of air, which, forming a dense body,
obstructs the light, and prevents our seeing the minute parts of the
objects.CCCVII./--_Why the Air is to appear whiter as it approaches
nearer to the Earth._


/As/ the air is thicker nearer the earth, and becomes thinner as it
rises, look, when the sun is in the east, towards the west, between the
north and south, and you will perceive that the thickest and lowest air
will receive more light from the sun than the thinner air, because its
beams meet with more resistance.If the sky terminate low, at the end of a plain, that part of it
nearest to the horizon, being seen only through the thick air, will
alter and break its natural colour, and will appear whiter than over
your head, where the visual ray does not pass through so much of that
gross air, corrupted by earthy vapours.But if you turn towards the
east, the air will be darker the nearer it approaches the earth; for
the air being thicker, does not admit the light of the sun to pass so
freely.CCCVIII./--_How to paint the distant Part of a Landscape._


/It/ is evident that the air is in some parts thicker and grosser than
in others, particularly that nearest to the earth; and as it rises
higher, it becomes thinner and more transparent.The objects which
are high and large, from which you are at some distance, will be less
apparent in the lower parts; because the visual ray which perceives
them, passes through a long space of dense air; and it is easy to prove
that the upper parts are seen by a line, which, though on the side of
the eye it originates in a thick air, nevertheless, as it ascends to
the highest summit of its object, terminates in an air much thinner
than that of the lower parts; and for that reason the more that line
or visual ray advances from the eye, it becomes, in its progress
from one point to another, thinner and thinner, passing from a pure
air into another which is purer; so that a painter who has mountains
to represent in a landscape, ought to observe, that from one hill
to another, the tops will appear always clearer than the bases.In
proportion as the distance from one to another is greater, the top will
be clearer; and the higher they are, the more they will shew their
variety of form and colour.CCCIX./--_Of precise and confused Objects._


/The/ parts that are near in the fore-ground should be finished in a
bold determined manner; but those in the distance must be unfinished,
and confused in their outlines.CCCX./--_Of distant Objects._


/That/ part of any object which is nearest to the luminary from which
it receives the light, will be the lightest.The representation of an object in every degree of distance, loses
degrees of its strength; that is, in proportion as the object is more
remote from the eye it will be less perceivable through the air in its
representation.CCCXI./--_Of Buildings seen in a thick Air._


[Illustration]

/That/ part of a building seen through a thick air, will appear less
distinct than another part seen through a thinner air.Therefore the
eye, N, looking at the tower A D, will see it more confusedly in the
lower degrees, but at the same time lighter; and as it ascends to the
other degrees it will appear more distinct, but somewhat darker.CCCXII./--_Of Towns and other Objects seen through a thick Air._


[Illustration]

/Buildings/ or towns seen through a fog, or the air made thick by
smoke or other vapours, will appear less distinct the lower they
are; and, _vice versa_, they will be sharper and more visible in
proportion as they are higher.We have said, in Chapter cccxxi.that
the air is thicker the lower it is, and thinner as it is higher.It is
demonstrated also by the cut, where the tower, A F, is seen by the eye
N, in a thick air, from B to F, which is divided into four degrees,
growing thicker as they are nearer the bottom.The less the quantity of
air interposed between the eye and its object is, the less also will
the colour of the object participate of the colour of that air.It
follows, that the greater the quantity of the air interposed between
the eye and the object seen, is, the more this object will participate
of the colour of the air.It is demonstrated thus: N being the eye
looking at the five parts of the tower A F, viz.A B C D E, I say,
that if the air were of the same thickness, there would be the same
proportion between the colour of the air at the bottom of the tower and
the colour of the air that the same tower has at the place B, as there
is in length between the line M and F. As, however, we have supposed
that the air is not of equal thickness, but, on the contrary, thicker
as it is lower, it follows, that the proportion by which the air tinges
the different elevations of the tower B C F, exceeds the proportion
of the lines; because the line M F, besides its being longer than the
line S B, passes by unequal degrees through a quality of air which is
unequal in thickness.CCCXIII./--_Of the inferior Extremities of distant Objects._


/The/ inferior or lower extremities of distant objects are not so
apparent as the upper extremities.This is observable in mountains
and hills, the tops of which detach from the sides of other mountains
behind.We see the tops of these more determined and distinctly than
their bases; because the upper extremities are darker, being less
encompassed by thick air, which always remains in the lower regions,
and makes them appear dim and confused.It is the same with trees,
buildings, and other objects high up.From this effect it often happens
that a high tower, seen at a great distance, will appear broad at top,
and narrow at bottom; because the thin air towards the top does not
prevent the angles on the sides and other different parts of the tower
from being seen, as the thick air does at bottom.This is demonstrated
by the seventh proposition[77], which says, that the thick air
interposed between the eye and the sun, is lighter below than above,
and where the air is whiteish, it confuses the dark objects more than if
such air were blueish or thinner, as it is higher up.The battlements
of a fortress have the spaces between equal to the breadth of the
battlement, and yet the space will appear wider; at a great distance
the battlements will appear very much diminished, and being removed
still farther, will disappear entirely, and the fort shew only the
straight wall, as if there were no battlements.CCCXIV./--_Which Parts of Objects disappear first by being
removed farther from the Eye, and which preserve their Appearance._


/The/ smallest parts are those which, by being removed, lose their
appearance first; this may be observed in the gloss upon spherical
bodies, or columns, and the slender parts of animals; as in a stag,
the first sight of which does not discover its legs and horns so soon
as its body, which, being broader, will be perceived from a greater
distance.But the parts which disappear the very first, are the lines
which describe the members, and terminate the surface and shape of
bodies.CCCXV./--_Why Objects are less distinguished in proportion as
they are farther removed from the Eye._


/This/ happens because the smallest parts are lost first; the second,
in point of size, are also lost at a somewhat greater distance, and so
on successively; the parts by degrees melting away, the perception of
the object is diminished; and at last all the parts, and the whole, are
entirely lost to the sight[78].Colours also disappear on account of
the density of the air interposed between the eye and the object.CCCXVI./--_Why Faces appear dark at a Distance._


/It/ is evident that the similitude of all objects placed before us,
large as well as small, is perceptible to our senses through the iris
of the eye.If through so small an entrance the immensity of the sky
and of the earth is admitted, the faces of men (which are scarcely any
thing in comparison of such large objects), being still diminished by
the distance, will occupy so little of the eye, that they become almost
imperceptible.Besides, having to pass through a dark medium from the
surface to the _Retina_ in the inside, where the impression is made,
the colour of faces (not being very strong, and rendered still more
obscure by the darkness of the tube) when arrived at the focus appears
dark.No other reason can be given on that point, except that the speck
in the middle of the apple of the eye is black, and, being full of a
transparent fluid like air, performs the same office as a hole in a
board, which on looking into it appears black; and that those things
which are seen through both a light and dark air, become confused and
obscure.CCCXVII./--_Of Towns and other Buildings seen through a Fog in
the Morning or Evening._


/Buildings/ seen afar off in the morning or in the evening, when there
is a fog, or thick air, shew only those parts distinctly which are
enlightened by the sun towards the horizon; and the parts of those
buildings which are not turned towards the sun remain confused and
almost of the colour of the fog.CCCXVIII./--_Of the Height of Buildings seen in a Fog._


/Of/ a building near the eye the top parts will appear more confused
than the bottom, because there is more fog between the eye and the top
than at the base.And a square tower, seen at a great distance through
a fog, will appear narrower at the base than at the summit.This is
accounted for in Chapter cccxiii.which says, that the fog will appear
whiter and thicker as it approaches the ground; and as it is said
before[79], that a dark object will appear smaller in proportion as it
is placed on a whiter ground.Therefore the fog being whiter at bottom
than at top, it follows that the tower (being darkish) will appear
narrower at the base than at the summit.CCCXIX./--_Why Objects which are high, appear darker at a
Distance than those which are low, though the Fog be uniform, and of
equal Thickness._


/Amongst/ objects situated in a fog, thick air, vapour, smoke, or at
a distance, the highest will be the most distinctly seen: and amongst
objects equal in height, that placed in the darkest fog, will be most
confused and dark.As it happens to the eye H, looking at A B C, three
towers of equal height; it sees the top C as low as R, in two degrees
of thickness; and the top B, in one degree only; therefore the top C
will appear darker than the top of the tower B.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXX./--_Of Objects seen in a Fog._


/Objects/ seen through a fog will appear larger than they are in
reality, because the aerial perspective does not agree with the linear,
viz.the colour does not agree with the magnitude of the object[80];
such a fog being similar to the thickness of air interposed between the
eye and the horizon in fine weather.But in this case the fog is near
the eye, and though the object be also near, it makes it appear as if
it were as far off as the horizon; where a great tower would appear no
bigger than a man placed near the eye.CCCXXI./--_Of those Objects which the Eyes perceive through a
Mist or thick Air._


/The/ nearer the air is to water, or to the ground, the thicker it
becomes.It is proved by the nineteenth proposition of the second
book[81], that bodies rise in proportion to their weight; and it
follows, that a light body will rise higher than another which is heavy.CCCXXII./--_Miscellaneous Observations._


/Of/ different objects equal in magnitude, form, shade, and distance
from the eye, those will appear the smaller that are placed on the
lighter ground.This is exemplified by observing the sun when seen
behind a tree without leaves; all the ramifications seen against that
great light are so diminished that they remain almost invisible.The
same may be observed of a pole placed between the sun and the eye.Parallel bodies placed upright, and seen through a fog, will
appear larger at top than at bottom.This is proved by the ninth
proposition[82], which says, that a fog, or thick air, penetrated by
the rays of the sun, will appear whiter the lower they are.Things seen afar off will appear out of proportion, because the parts
which are the lightest will send their image with stronger rays than
the parts which are darkest.I have seen a woman dressed in black,
with a white veil over her head, which appeared twice as large as her
shoulders covered with black.MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.CCCXXIII./--_Of Objects seen at a Distance._


/Any/ dark object will appear lighter when removed to some distance
from the eye.It follows, by the contrary reason, that a dark object
will appear still darker when brought nearer to the eye.Therefore the
inferior parts of any object whatever, placed in thick air, will appear
farther from the eye at the bottom than at the top; for that reason the
lower parts of a mountain appear farther off than its top, which is in
reality the farthest.CCCXXIV./--_Of a Town seen through a thick Air._


/The/ eye which, looking downwards, sees a town immersed in very thick
air, will perceive the top of the buildings darker, but more distinct
than the bottom.The tops detach against a light ground, because they
are seen against the low and thick air which is beyond them.This is a
consequence of what has been explained in the preceding chapter.CCCXXV./--_How to draw a Landscape._


/Contrive/ that the trees in your landscape be half in shadow and half
in the light.It is better to represent them as when the sun is veiled
with thin clouds, because in that case the trees receive a general
light from the sky, and are darkest in those parts which are nearest to
the earth.CCCXXVI./--_Of the Green of the Country._


/Of/ the greens seen in the country, that of trees and other plants
will appear darker than that of fields and meadows, though they may
happen to be of the same quality.CCCXXVII./--_What Greens will appear most of a blueish Cast._


/Those/ greens will appear to approach nearest to blue which are
of the darkest shade when remote.This is proved by the seventh
proposition[83], which says, that blue is composed of black and white
seen at a great distance.CCCXXVIII./--_The Colour of the Sea from different Aspects._


/When/ the sea is a little ruffled it has no sameness of colour; for
whoever looks at it from the shore, will see it of a dark colour, in a
greater degree as it approaches towards the horizon, and will perceive
also certain lights moving slowly on the surface like a flock of sheep.Whoever looks at the sea from on board a ship, at a distance from the
land, sees it blue.Near the shore it appears darkish, on account of
the colour of the earth reflected by the water, as in a looking-glass;
but at sea the azure of the air is reflected to the eye by the waves in
the same manner.CCCXXIX./--_Why the same Prospect appears larger at some Times
than at others._


/Objects/ in the country appear sometimes larger and sometimes smaller
than they actually are, from the circumstance of the air interposed
between the eye and the horizon, happening to be either thicker or
thinner than usual.Of two horizons equally distant from the eye, that which is seen
through the thicker air will appear farther removed; and the other will
seem nearer, being seen through a thinner air.Objects of unequal size, but equally distant, will appear equal if the
air which is between them and the eye be of proportionable inequality
of thickness, viz.if the thickest air be interposed between the eye
and the smallest of the objects.This is proved by the perspective of
colours[84], which is so deceitful that a mountain which would appear
small by the compasses, will seem larger than a small hill near the
eye; as a finger placed near the eye will cover a large mountain far
off.CCCXXX./--_Of Smoke._


/Smoke/ is more transparent, though darker towards the extremities of
its waves than in the middle.It moves in a more oblique direction in proportion to the force of the
wind which impels it.Different kinds of smoke vary in colour, as the causes that produce
them are various.Smoke never produces determined shadows, and the extremities are lost
as they recede from their primary cause.Objects behind it are less
apparent in proportion to the thickness of the smoke.It is whiter
nearer its origin, and bluer towards its termination.Fire appears darker, the more smoke there is interposed between it and
the eye.Where smoke is farther distant, the objects are less confused by it.It encumbers and dims all the landscape like a fog.Smoke is seen to
issue from different places, with flames at the origin, and the most
dense part of it.The tops of mountains will be more seen than the
lower parts, as in a fog.CCCXXXI./--_In what Part Smoke is lightest._


/Smoke/ which is seen between the sun and the eye will be lighter and
more transparent than any other in the landscape.The same is observed
of dust, and of fog; while, if you place yourself between the sun and
those objects, they will appear dark.CCCXXXII./--_Of the Sun-beams passing through the Openings of
Clouds._


/The/ sun-beams which penetrate the openings interposed between clouds
of various density and form, illuminate all the places over which they
pass, and tinge with their own colour all the dark places that are
behind: which dark places are only seen in the intervals between the
rays.CCCXXXIII./--_Of the Beginning of Rain._


/When/ the rain begins to fall, it tarnishes and darkens the air,
giving it a dull colour, but receives still on one side a faint light
from the sun, and is shaded on the other side, as we observe in clouds;
till at last it darkens also the earth, depriving it entirely of the
light of the sun.Objects seen through the rain appear confused and of
undetermined shape, but those which are near will be more distinct.It
is observable, that on the side where the rain is shaded, objects will
be more clearly distinguished than where it receives the light; because
on the shady side they lose only their principal lights, whilst on
the other they lose both their lights and shadows, the lights mixing
with the light part of the rain, and the shadows are also considerably
weakened by it.CCCXXXIV./--_The Seasons are to be observed._


/In/ Autumn you will represent the objects according as it is more or
less advanced.At the beginning of it the leaves of the oldest branches
only begin to fade, more or less, however, according as the plant is
situated in a fertile or barren country; and do not imitate those who
represent trees of every kind (though at equal distance) with the same
quality of green.Endeavour to vary the colour of meadows, stones,
trunks of trees, and all other objects, as much as possible, for Nature
abounds in variety _ad infinitum_.CCCXXXV./--_The Difference of Climates to be observed._


/Near/ the sea-shore, and in southern parts, you will be careful not to
represent the Winter season by the appearance of trees and fields, as
you would do in places more inland, and in northern countries, except
when these are covered with ever-greens, which shoot afresh all the
year round.CCCXXXVI./--_Of Dust._


/Dust/ becomes lighter the higher it rises, and appears darker the less
it is raised, when it is seen between the eye and the sun.CCCXXXVII./--_How to represent the Wind._


/In/ representing the effect of the wind, besides the bending of trees,
and leaves twisting the wrong side upwards, you will also express the
small dust whirling upwards till it mixes in a confused manner with the
air.CCCXXXVIII./--_Of a Wilderness._


/Those/ trees and shrubs which are by their nature more loaded with
small branches, ought to be touched smartly in the shadows, but those
which have larger foliage, will cause broader shadows.CCCXXXIX./--_Of the Horizon seen in the Water._


/By/ the sixth proposition[85], the horizon will be seen in the water
as in a looking-glass, on that side which is opposite the eye.And
if the painter has to represent a spot covered with water, let him
remember that the colour of it cannot be either lighter or darker than
that of the neighbouring objects.CCCXL./--_Of the Shadow of Bridges on the Surface of the Water._


/The/ shadows of bridges can never be seen on the surface of the water,
unless it should have lost its transparent and reflecting quality,
and become troubled and muddy; because clear water being polished and
smooth on its surface, the image of the bridge is formed in it as in
a looking-glass, and reflected in all the points situated between the
eye and the bridge at equal angles; and even the air is seen under the
arches.These circumstances cannot happen when the water is muddy,
because it does not reflect the objects any longer, but receives the
shadow of the bridge in the same manner as a dusty road would receive
it.CCCXLI./--_How a Painter ought to put in Practice the
Perspective of Colours._


/To/ put in practice that perspective which teaches the alteration, the
lessening, and even the entire loss of the very essence of colours,
you must take some points in the country at the distance of about
sixty-five yards[86] from each other; as trees, men, or some other
remarkable objects.In regard to the first tree, you will take a glass,
and having fixed that well, and also your eye, draw upon it, with the
greatest accuracy, the tree you see through it; then put it a little
on one side, and compare it closely with the natural one, and colour
it, so that in shape and colour it may resemble the original, and that
by shutting one eye they may both appear painted, and at the same
distance.The same rule may be applied to the second and third tree
at the distance you have fixed.These studies will be very useful if
managed with judgment, where they may be wanted in the offscape of a
picture.I have observed that the second tree is less by four fifths
than the first, at the distance of thirteen yards.CCCXLII./--_Various Precepts in Painting._


/The/ superficies of any opake body participates of the colour of the
transparent medium interposed between the eye and such body, in a
greater or less degree, in proportion to the density of such medium and
the space it occupies.The outlines of opake bodies will be less apparent in proportion as
those bodies are farther distant from the eye.That part of the opake body will be the most shaded, or lightest, which
is nearest to the body that shades it, or gives it light.The surface of any opake body participates more or less of the colour
of that body which gives it light, in proportion as the latter is more
or less remote, or more or less strong.Objects seen between lights and shadows will appear to have greater
relievo than those which are placed wholly in the light, or wholly in
shadow.When you give strength and precision to objects seen at a great
distance, they will appear as if they were very near.Endeavour that
your imitation be such as to give a just idea of distances.If the
object in nature appear confused in the outlines, let the same be
observed in your picture.The outlines of distant objects appear undetermined and confused,
for two reasons: the first is, that they come to the eye by so small
an angle, and are therefore so much diminished, that they strike the
sight no more than small objects do, which though near can hardly be
distinguished, such as the nails of the fingers, insects, and other
similar things: the second is, that between the eye and the distant
objects there is so much air interposed, that it becomes thick; and,
like a veil, tinges the shadows with its own whiteness, and turns them
from a dark colour to another between black and white, such as azure.Although, by reason of the great distance, the appearance of many
things is lost, yet those things which receive the light from the sun
will be more discernible, while the rest remain enveloped in confused
shadows.And because the air is thicker near the ground, the things
which are lower will appear confused; and _vice versa_.When the sun tinges the clouds on the horizon with red, those objects
which, on account of their distance, appear blueish, will participate
of that redness, and will produce a mixture between the azure and red,
which renders the prospect lively and pleasant; all the opake bodies
which receive that light will appear distinct, and of a reddish colour,
and the air, being transparent, will be impregnated with it, and appear
of the colour of lilies[87].The air which is between the earth and the sun when it rises or sets,
will always dim the objects it surrounds, more than the air any where
else, because it is whiter.It is not necessary to mark strongly the outlines of any object which
is placed upon another.If the outline or extremity of a white and curved surface terminate
upon another white body, it will have a shade at that extremity, darker
than any part of the light; but if against a dark object, such outline,
or extremity, will be lighter than any part of the light.Those objects which are most different in colour, will appear the most
detached from each other.Those parts of objects which first disappear in the distance, are
extremities similar in colour, and ending one upon the other, as the
extremities of an oak tree upon another oak similar to it.The next to
disappear at a greater distance are, objects of mixed colours, when
they terminate one upon the other, as trees, ploughed fields, walls,
heaps of rubbish, or of stones.The last extremities of bodies that
vanish are those which, being light, terminate upon a dark ground; or
being dark, upon a light ground.Of objects situated above the eye, at equal heights, the farthest
removed from the eye will appear the lowest; and if situated below
the eye, the nearest to it will appear the lowest.The parallel lines
situated sidewise will concur to one point[88].Those objects which are near a river, or a lake, in the distant part of
a landscape, are less apparent and distinct than those that are remote
from them.Of bodies of equal density, those that are nearest to the eye will
appear thinnest, and the most remote thickest.A large eye-ball will see objects larger than a small one.The
experiment may be made by looking at any of the celestial bodies,
through a pin-hole, which being capable of admitting but a portion
of its light, it seems to diminish and lose of its size in the same
proportion as the pin-hole is smaller than the usual apparent size of
the object.A thick air interposed between the eye and any object, will render the
outlines of such object undetermined and confused, and make it appear
of a larger size than it is in reality; because the linear perspective
does not diminish the angle which conveys the object to the eye.The
aerial perspective carries it farther off, so that the one removes it
from the eye, while the other preserves its magnitude[89].When the sun is in the West the vapours of the earth fall down again
and thicken the air, so that objects not enlightened by the sun remain
dark and confused, but those which receive its light will be tinged
yellow and red, according to the sun's appearance on the horizon.Again, those that receive its light are very distinct, particularly
public buildings and houses in towns and villages, because their
shadows are dark, and it seems as if those parts which are plainly seen
were coming out of confused and undetermined foundations, because at
that time every thing is of one and the same colour, except what is
enlightened by the sun[90].Any object receiving the light from the sun, receives also the general
light; so that two kinds of shadows are produced: the darkest of the
two is that which happens to have its central line directed towards the
centre of the sun.The central lines of the primitive and secondary
lights are the same as the central lines of the primitive and secondary
shadows.The setting sun is a beautiful and magnificent object when it tinges
with its colour all the great buildings of towns, villages, and the top
of high trees in the country.All below is confused and almost lost in
a tender and general mass; for, being only enlightened by the air, the
difference between the shadows and the lights is small, and for that
reason it is not much detached.But those that are high are touched
by the rays of the sun, and, as was said before, are tinged with its
colour; the painter therefore ought to take the same colour with which
he has painted the sun, and employ it in all those parts of his work
which receive its light.It also happens very often, that a cloud will appear dark without
receiving any shadow from a separate cloud, according to the situation
of the eye; because it will see only the shady part of the one, while
it sees both the enlightened and shady parts of the other.Of two objects at equal height, that which is the farthest off will
appear the lowest.Observe the first cloud in the cut, though it
is lower than the second, it appears as if it were higher.This is
demonstrated by the section of the pyramidical rays of the low cloud at
M A, and the second (which is higher) at N M, below M A. This happens
also when, on account of the rays of the setting or rising sun, a dark
cloud appears higher than another which is light.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXLIII./--_The Brilliancy of a Landscape._


/The/ vivacity and brightness of colours in a landscape will never bear
any comparison with a landscape in nature when illumined by the sun,
unless the picture be placed so as to receive the same light from the
sun itself.MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.CCCXLIV./--_Why a painted Object does not appear so far distant
as a real one, though they be conveyed to the Eye by equal Angles._


[Illustration]

/If/ a house be painted on the pannel B C, at the apparent distance of
one mile, and by the side of it a real one be perceived at the true
distance of one mile also; which objects are so disposed, that the
pannel, or picture, A C, intersects the pyramidical rays with the same
opening of angles; yet these two objects will never appear of the same
size, nor at the same distance, if seen with both eyes[91].CCCXLV./--_How to draw a Figure standing upon its Feet, to
appear forty Braccia_[92] _high, in a Space of twenty Braccia, with
proportionate Members._


/In/ this, as in any other case, the painter is not to mind what kind
of surface he has to work upon; particularly if his painting is to be
seen from a determined point, such as a window, or any other opening.Because the eye is not to attend to the evenness or roughness of the
wall, but only to what is to be represented as beyond that wall; such
as a landscape, or any thing else.Nevertheless a curved surface, such
as F R G, would be the best, because it has no angles.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXLVI./--_How to draw a Figure twenty-four Braccia high, upon
a Wall twelve Braccia high._ Plate XXII./Draw/ upon part of the wall M N, half the figure you mean to
represent; and the other half upon the cove above, M R. But before
that, it will be necessary to draw upon a flat board, or a paper, the
profile of the wall and cove, of the same shape and dimension, as that
upon which you are to paint.Then draw also the profile of your figure,
of whatever size you please, by the side of it; draw all the lines to
the point F, and where they intersect the profile M R, you will have
the dimensions of your figure as they ought to be drawn upon the real
spot.You will find, that on the straight part of the wall M N, it will
come of its proper form, because the going off perpendicularly will
diminish it naturally; but that part which comes upon the curve will be
diminished upon your drawing.The whole must be traced afterwards upon
the real spot, which is similar to M N. This is a good and safe method._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.CCCXLVII./--_Why, on measuring a Face, and then painting it of
the same Size, it will appear larger than the natural one._


A B is the breadth of the space, or of the head, and it is placed on
the paper at the distance C F, where the cheeks are, and it would have
to stand back all A C, and then the temples would be carried to the
distance O R of the lines A F, B F; so that there is the difference C
O and R D. It follows that the line C F, and the line D F, in order
to become shorter[93], have to go and find the paper where the whole
height is drawn, that is to say, the lines F A, and F B, where the true
size is; and so it makes the difference, as I have said, of C O, and R
D.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXLVIII./--_Why the most perfect Imitation of Nature will not
appear to have the same Relief as Nature itself._


/If/ nature is seen with two eyes, it will be impossible to imitate it
upon a picture so as to appear with the same relief, though the lines,
the lights, shades, and colour, be perfectly imitated[94].It is proved
thus: let the eyes A B, look at the object C, with the concurrence of
both the central visual rays A C and B C. I say, that the sides of the
visual angles (which contain these central rays) will see the space G
D, behind the object C. The eye A will see all the space FD, and the
eye B all the space G E. Therefore the two eyes will see behind the
object C all the space F E; for which reason that object C becomes as
it were transparent, according to the definition of transparent bodies,
behind which nothing is hidden.This cannot happen if an object were
seen with one eye only, provided it be larger than the eye.From all
that has been said, we may conclude, that a painted object, occupying
all the space it has behind, leaves no possible way to see any part of
the ground, which it covers entirely by its own circumference[95].[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXLIX./--_Universality of Painting; a Precept._


/A painter/ cannot be said to aim at universality in the art, unless
he love equally every species of that art.For instance, if he delight
only in landscape, his can be esteemed only as a simple investigation;
and, as our friend Botticello[96] remarks, is but a vain study; since,
by throwing a sponge impregnated with various colours against a wall,
it leaves some spots upon it, which may appear like a landscape.It is
true also, that a variety of compositions may be seen in such spots,
according to the disposition of mind with which they are considered;
such as heads of men, various animals, battles, rocky scenes, seas,
clouds, woods, and the like.It may be compared to the sound of bells,
which may seem to say whatever we choose to imagine.In the same manner
also, those spots may furnish hints for compositions, though they do
not teach us how to finish any particular part; and the imitators of
them are but sorry landscape-painters.CCCL./--_In what Manner the Mirror is the true Master of
Painters._


/When/ you wish to know if your picture be like the object you mean to
represent, have a flat looking-glass, and place it so as to reflect the
object you have imitated, and compare carefully the original with the
copy.You see upon a flat mirror the representation of things which
appear real; Painting is the same.They are both an even superficies,
and both give the idea of something beyond their superficies.Since you
are persuaded that the looking-glass, by means of lines and shades,
gives you the representation of things as if they were real; you being
in possession of colours which in their different lights and shades are
stronger than those of the looking-glass, may certainly, if you employ
the rules with judgment, give to your picture the same appearance of
Nature as you admire in the looking-glass.Or rather, your picture will
be like Nature itself seen in a large looking-glass.This looking-glass (being your master) will shew you the lights and
shades of any object whatever.Amongst your colours there are some
lighter than the lightest part of your model, and also some darker
than the strongest shades; from which it follows, that you ought to
represent Nature as seen in your looking-glass, when you look at it
with one eye only; because both eyes surround the objects too much,
particularly when they are small[97].CCCLI./--_Which Painting is to be esteemed the best._


/That/ painting is the most commendable which has the greatest
conformity to what is meant to be imitated.This kind of comparison
will often put to shame a certain description of painters, who pretend
they can mend the works of Nature; as they do, for instance, when
they pretend to represent a child twelve months old, giving him eight
heads in height, when Nature in its best proportion admits but five.The breadth of the shoulders also, which is equal to the head, they
make double, giving to a child a year old, the proportions of a man of
thirty.They have so often practised, and seen others practise these
errors, that they have converted them into habit, which has taken so
deep a root in their corrupted judgment, that they persuade themselves
that Nature and her imitators are wrong in not following their own
practice[98].CCCLII./--_Of the Judgment to be made of a Painter's Work._


/The/ first thing to be considered is, whether the figures have their
proper relief, according to their respective situations, and the light
they are in: that the shadows be not the same at the extremities of
the groups, as in the middle; because being surrounded by shadows, or
shaded only on one side, produce very different effects.The groups in
the middle are surrounded by shadows from the other figures, which are
between them and the light.Those which are at the extremities have
the shadows only on one side, and receive the light on the other.The
strongest and smartest touches of shadows are to be in the interstice
between the figures of the principal group where the light cannot
penetrate[99].Secondly, that by the order and disposition of the figures they appear
to be accommodated to the subject, and the true representation of the
history in question.Thirdly, that the figures appear alive to the occasion which brought
them together, with expressions suited to their attitudes.CCCLIII./--_How to make an imaginary Animal appear natural._


/It/ is evident that it will be impossible to invent any animal without
giving it members, and these members must individually resemble those
of some known animal.If you wish, therefore, to make a chimera, or imaginary animal, appear
natural (let us suppose a serpent); take the head of a mastiff, the
eyes of a cat, the ears of a porcupine, the mouth of a hare, the
brows of a lion, the temples of an old cock, and the neck of a sea
tortoise[100].CCCLIV./--_Painters are not to imitate one another._


/One/ painter ought never to imitate the manner of any other; because
in that case he cannot be called the child of Nature, but the
grandchild.It is always best to have recourse to Nature, which is
replete with such abundance of objects, than to the productions of
other masters, who learnt every thing from her.CCCLV./--_How to judge of one's own Work._


/It/ is an acknowledged fact, that we perceive errors in the works of
others more readily than in our own.A painter, therefore, ought to
be well instructed in perspective, and acquire a perfect knowledge of
the dimensions of the human body; he should also be a good architect,
at least as far as concerns the outward shape of buildings, with their
different parts; and where he is deficient, he ought not to neglect
taking drawings from Nature.It will be well also to have a looking-glass by him, when he paints,
to look often at his work in it, which being seen the contrary way,
will appear as the work of another hand, and will better shew his
faults.It will be useful also to quit his work often, and take some
relaxation, that his judgment may be clearer at his return; for too
great application and sitting still is sometimes the cause of many
gross errors.CCCLVI./--_Of correcting Errors which you discover._


/Remember/, that when, by the exercise of your own judgment, or the
observation of others, you discover any errors in your work, you
immediately set about correcting them, lest, in exposing your works to
the public, you expose your defects also.Admit not any self-excuse,
by persuading yourself that you shall retrieve your character, and
that by some succeeding work you shall make amends for your shameful
negligence; for your work does not perish as soon as it is out of your
hands, like the sound of music, but remains a standing monument of your
ignorance.If you excuse yourself by saying that you have not time for
the study necessary to form a great painter, having to struggle against
necessity, you yourself are only to blame; for the study of what is
excellent is food both for mind and body.How many philosophers, born
to great riches, have given them away, that they might not be retarded
in their pursuits!CCCLVII./--_The best Place for looking at a Picture._


/Let/ us suppose, that A B is the picture, receiving the light from D;
I say, that whoever is placed between C and E, will see the picture
very badly, particularly if it be painted in oil, or varnished; because
it will shine, and will appear almost of the nature of a looking-glass.For these reasons, the nearer you go towards C, the less you will be
able to see, because of the light from the window upon the picture,
sending its reflection to that point.But if you place yourself between
E D, you may conveniently see the picture, and the more so as you draw
nearer to the point D, because that place is less liable to be struck
by the reflected rays.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCLVIII./--_Of Judgment._


/There/ is nothing more apt to deceive us than our own judgment, in
deciding on our own works; and we should derive more advantage from
having our faults pointed out by our enemies, than by hearing the
opinions of our friends, because they are too much like ourselves, and
may deceive us as much as our own judgment.CCCLIX./--_Of Employment anxiously wished for by Painters._


/And/ you, painter, who are desirous of great practice, understand,
that if you do not rest it on the good foundation of Nature, you will
labour with little honour and less profit; and if you do it on a good
ground your works will be many and good, to your great honour and
advantage.CCCLX./--_Advice to Painters._


/A painter/ ought to study universal Nature, and reason much within
himself on all he sees, making use of the most excellent parts that
compose the species of every object before him.His mind will by this
method be like a mirror, reflecting truly every object placed before
it, and become, as it were, a second Nature.CCCLXI./--_Of Statuary._


/To/ execute a figure in marble, you must first make a model of it in
clay, or plaster, and when it is finished, place it in a square case,
equally capable of receiving the block of marble intended to be shaped
like it.Have some peg-like sticks to pass through holes made in the
sides, and all round the case; push them in till every one touches the
model, marking what remains of the sticks outwards with ink, and making
a countermark to every stick and its hole, so that you may at pleasure
replace them again.Then having taken out the model, and placed the
block of marble in its stead, take so much out of it, till all the pegs
go in at the same holes to the marks you had made.To facilitate the
work, contrive your frame so that every part of it, separately, or all
together, may be lifted up, except the bottom, which must remain under
the marble.By this method you may chop it off with great facility[101].CCCLXII./--_On the Measurement and Division of Statues into
Parts._


/Divide/ the head into twelve parts, each part into twelve degrees,
each degree into twelve minutes, and these minutes into seconds[102].CCCLXIII./--_A Precept for the Painter._


/The/ painter who entertains no doubt of his own ability, will attain
very little.When the work succeeds beyond the judgment, the artist
acquires nothing; but when the judgment is superior to the work, he
never ceases improving, if the love of gain do not <DW44> his progress.CCCLXIV./--_On the Judgment of Painters._


/When/ the work is equal to the knowledge and judgment of the painter,
it is a bad sign; and when it surpasses the judgment, it is still
worse, as is the case with those who wonder at having succeeded so
well.But when the judgment surpasses the work, it is a perfectly good
sign; and the young painter who possesses that rare disposition, will,
no doubt, arrive at great perfection.He will produce few works, but
they will be such as to fix the admiration of every beholder.CCCLXV./--_That a Man ought not to trust to himself, but ought
to consult Nature._


/Whoever/ flatters himself that he can retain in his memory all the
effects of Nature, is deceived, for our memory is not so capacious;
therefore consult Nature for every thing.BOOKS

was to paint in the church della Nunziata, at Florence.Francis I. got

and supposed to require, that the student should be a deep proficient
in perspective, before he commences the study of painting; but it is
a knowledge of the leading principles only of perspective that the
author here means, and without such a knowledge, which is easily to be
acquired, the student will inevitably fall into errors, as gross as
those humorously pointed out by Hogarth, in his Frontispiece to Kirby's
Perspective.][Footnote 3: Not to be found in this work.][Footnote 4: From this, and many other similar passages, it is evident,
that the author intended at some future time to arrange his manuscript
collections, and to publish them as separate treatises.That he did not
do so is well known; but it is also a fact, that, in selecting from the
whole mass of his collections the chapters of which the present work
consists, great care appears in general to have been taken to extract
also those to which there was any reference from any of the chapters
intended for this work, or which from their subject were necessarily
connected with them.Accordingly, the reader will find, in the notes
to this translation, that all such chapters in any other part of the
present work are uniformly pointed out, as have any relation to the
respective passages in the text.This, which has never before been
done, though indispensably necessary, will be found of singular use,
and it was thought proper here, once for all, to notice it.In the present instance the chapters, referring to the subject in the
text, are Chap.; and though these
do not afford complete information, yet it is to be remembered, that
drawing from relievos is subject to the very same rules as drawing from
Nature; and that, therefore, what is elsewhere said on that subject is
also equally applicable to this.][Footnote 5: The meaning of this is, that the last touches of light,
such as the shining parts (which are always narrow), must be given
sparingly.In short, that the drawing must be kept in broad masses as
much as possible.][Footnote 6: This is not an absolute rule, but it is a very good one
for drawing of portraits.][Footnote 9: See the two preceding chapters.][Footnote 10: Man being the highest of the animal creation, ought to be
the chief object of study.][Footnote 11: An intended Treatise, as it seems, on Anatomy, which
however never was published; but there are several chapters in the
present work on the subject of Anatomy, most of which will be found
under the present head of Anatomy; and of such as could not be placed
there, because they also related to some other branch, the following
is a list by which they may be found: Chapters vi.[Footnote 13: It does not appear that this intention was ever carried
into execution; but there are many chapters in this work on the subject
of motion, where all that is necessary for a painter in this branch
will be found.][Footnote 14: Anatomists have divided this muscle into four or five
sections; but painters, following the ancient sculptors, shew only
the three principal ones; and, in fact, we find that a greater number
of them (as may often be observed in nature) gives a disagreeable
meagreness to the subject.Beautiful nature does not shew more than
three, though there may be more hid under the skin.][Footnote 15: A treatise on weights, like many others, intended by this
author, but never published.][Footnote 17: It is believed that this treatise, like many others
promised by the author, was never written; and to save the necessity of
frequently repeating this fact, the reader is here informed, once for
all, that in the life of the author prefixed to this edition, will be
found an account of the works promised or projected by him, and how far
his intentions have been carried into effect.][Footnote 19: See in this work from chap.[Footnote 22: The author here means to compare the different quickness
of the motion of the head and the heel, when employed in the same
action of jumping; and he states the proportion of the former to be
three times that of the latter.The reason he gives for this is in
substance, that as the head has but one motion to make, while in fact
the lower part of the figure has three successive operations to perform
at the places he mentions, three times the velocity, or, in other
words, three times the degree of effort, is necessary in the head, the
prime mover, to give the power of influencing the other parts; and
the rule deducible from this axiom is, that where two different parts
of the body concur in the same action, and one of them has to perform
one motion only, while the other is to have several, the proportion of
velocity or effort in the former must be regulated by the number of
operations necessary in the latter.][Footnote 23: It is explained in this work, or at least there is
something respecting it in the preceding chapter, and in chap.[Footnote 24: The eyeball moving up and down to look at the hand,
describes a part of a circle, from every point of which it sees it
in an infinite variety of aspects.The hand also is moveable _ad
infinitum_ (for it can go round the whole circle--see chap.),
and consequently shew itself in an infinite variety of aspects, which
it is impossible for any memory to retain.][Footnote 26: About thirteen yards of our measure, the Florentine
braccia, or cubit, by which the author measures, being 1 foot 10 inches
7-8ths English measure.][Footnote 28: It is supposed that the figures are to appear of the
natural size, and not bigger.In that case, the measure of the first,
to be of the exact dimension, should have its feet resting upon the
bottom line; but as you remove it from that, it should diminish.No allusion is here intended to the distance at which a picture is to
be placed from the eye.][Footnote 29: The author does not mean here to say, that one historical
picture cannot be hung over another.It certainly may, because, in
viewing each, the spectator is at liberty (especially if they are
subjects independent of each other) to shift his place so as to stand
at the true point of sight for viewing every one of them; but in
covering a wall with a succession of subjects from the same history,
the author considers the whole as, in fact, but one picture, divided
into compartments, and to be seen at one view, and which cannot
therefore admit more than one point of sight.In the former case, the
pictures are in fact so many distinct subjects unconnected with each
other.]This chapter is obscure, and may probably be made clear by merely
stating it in other words.Leonardo objects to the use of both eyes,
because, in viewing in that manner the objects here mentioned, two
balls, one behind the other, the second is seen, which would not be
the case, if the angle of the visual rays were not too big for the
first object.Whoever is at all acquainted with optics, need not be
told, that the visual rays commence in a single point in the centre, or
nearly the centre of each eye, and continue diverging.But, in using
both eyes, the visual rays proceed not from one and the same centre,
but from a different centre in each eye, and intersecting each other,
as they do a little before passing the first object, they become
together broader than the extent of the first object, and consequently
give a view of part of the second.On the contrary, in using but one
eye, the visual rays proceed but from one centre; and as, therefore,
there cannot be any intersection, the visual rays, when they reach the
first object, are not broader than the first object, and the second is
completely hidden.Properly speaking, therefore, in using both eyes we
introduce more than one point of sight, which renders the perspective
false in the painting; but in using one eye only, there can be, as
there ought, but one point of sight.There is, however, this difference
between viewing real objects and those represented in painting, that in
looking at the former, whether we use one or both eyes, the objects,
by being actually detached from the back ground, admit the visual rays
to strike on them, so as to form a correct perspective, from whatever
point they are viewed, and the eye accordingly forms a perspective of
its own; but in viewing the latter, there is no possibility of varying
the perspective; and, unless the picture is seen precisely under the
same angle as it was painted under, the perspective in all other views
must be false.This is observable in the perspective views painted for
scenes at the playhouse.If the beholder is seated in the central line
of the house, whether in the boxes or pit, the perspective is correct;
but, in proportion as he is placed at a greater or less distance to the
right or left of that line, the perspective appears to him more or less
faulty.And hence arises the necessity of using but one eye in viewing
a painting, in order thereby to reduce it to one point of sight.][Footnote 32: See the Life of the Author prefixed, and chap.[Footnote 33: The author here speaks of unpolished Nature; and indeed
it is from such subjects only, that the genuine and characteristic
operations of Nature are to be learnt.It is the effect of education
to correct the natural peculiarities and defects, and, by so doing, to
assimilate one person to the rest of the world.][Footnote 36: See chapter cclxvii.][Footnote 37: Sir Joshua Reynolds frequently inculcated these precepts
in his lectures, and indeed they cannot be too often enforced.][Footnote 38: Probably this would have formed a part of his intended
Treatise on Light and Shadow, but no such proposition occurs in the
present work.][Footnote 41: This cannot be taken as an absolute rule; it must be left
in a great measure to the judgment of the painter.For much graceful
softness and grandeur is acquired, sometimes, by blending the lights of
the figures with the light part of the ground; and so of the shadows;
as Leonardo himself has observed in chapters cxciv.and Sir
Joshua Reynolds has often put in practice with success.][Footnote 44: He means here to say, that in proportion as the body
interposed between the eye and the object is more or less transparent,
the greater or less quantity of the colour of the body interposed will
be communicated to the object.][Footnote 45: See the note to chap.[Footnote 46: See the preceding chapter, and chap.[Footnote 47: The appearance of motion is lessened according to the
distance, in the same proportion as objects diminish in size.][Footnote 50: This was intended to constitute a part of some book of
Perspective, which we have not; but the rule here referred to will be
found in chap.[Footnote 52: No such work was ever published, nor, for any thing that
appears, ever written.][Footnote 53: The French translation of 1716 has a note on this
chapter, saying, that the invention of enamel painting found out since
the time of Leonardo da Vinci, would better answer to the title of this
chapter, and also be a better method of painting.I must beg leave,
however, to dissent from this opinion, as the two kinds of painting
are so different, that they cannot be compared.Leonardo treats of oil
painting, but the other is vitrification.Leonardo is known to have
spent a great deal of time in experiments, of which this is a specimen,
and it may appear ridiculous to the practitioners of more modern
date, as he does not enter more fully into a minute description of
the materials, or the mode of employing them.The principle laid down
in the text appears to me to be simply this: to make the oil entirely
evaporate from the colours by the action of fire, and afterwards to
prevent the action of the air by the means of a glass, which in itself
is an excellent principle, but not applicable, any more than enamel
painting to large works.][Footnote 54: It is evident that distemper or size painting is here
meant.][Footnote 56: This rule is not without exception: see chap.[Footnote 59: See chapters ccxlvii.Probably they were intended to form a part of a distinct treatise, and
to have been ranged as propositions in that, but at present they are
not so placed.][Footnote 62: Although the author seems to have designed that this, and
many other propositions to which he refers, should have formed a part
of some regular work, and he has accordingly referred to them whenever
he has mentioned them, by their intended numerical situation in that
work, whatever it might be, it does not appear that he ever carried
this design into execution.There are, however, several chapters in
the present work, viz.in which the
principle in the text is recognised, and which probably would have been
transferred into the projected treatise, if he had ever drawn it up.][Footnote 63: The note on the preceding chapter is in a great measure
applicable to this, and the proposition mentioned in the text is also
to be found in chapter ccxlvii.[Footnote 64: See the note on the chapter next but one preceding.The
proposition in the text occurs in chap.[Footnote 66: I do not know a better comment on this passage than
Felibien's Examination of Le Brun's Picture of the Tent of Darius.From this (which has been reprinted with an English translation, by
Colonel Parsons in 1700, in folio) it will clearly appear, what the
chain of connexion is between every colour there used, and its nearest
neighbour, and consequently a rule may be formed from it with more
certainty and precision than where the student is left to develope
it for himself, from the mere inspection of different examples of
colouring.]We have before remarked, that the propositions so
frequently referred to by the author, were never reduced into form,
though apparently he intended a regular work in which they were to be
included.][Footnote 68: No where in this work.][Footnote 69: This is evident in many of Vandyke's portraits,
particularly of ladies, many of whom are dressed in black velvet; and
this remark will in some measure account for the delicate fairness
which he frequently gives to the female complexion.][Footnote 70: These propositions, any more than the others mentioned
in different parts of this work, were never digested into a regular
treatise, as was evidently intended by the author, and consequently are
not to be found, except perhaps in some of the volumes of the author's
manuscript collections.][Footnote 73: This book on perspective was never drawn up.][Footnote 76: There is no work of this author to which this can at
present refer, but the principle is laid down in chapters cclxxxiv.[Footnote 77: See chapters cccvii.[Footnote 80: To our obtaining a correct idea of the magnitude and
distance of any object seen from afar, it is necessary that we consider
how much of distinctness an object loses at a distance (from the mere
interposition of the air), as well as what it loses in size; and these
two considerations must unite before we can decidedly pronounce as to
its distance or magnitude.This calculation, as to distinctness, must
be made upon the idea that the air is clear, as, if by any accident it
is otherwise, we shall (knowing the proportion in which clear air dims
a prospect) be led to conclude this farther off than it is, and, to
justify that conclusion, shall suppose its real magnitude correspondent
with the distance, at which from its degree of distinctness it appears
to be.In the circumstance remarked in the text there is, however, a
great deception; the fact is, that the colour and the minute parts of
the object are lost in the fog, while the size of it is not diminished
in proportion; and the eye being accustomed to see objects diminished
in size at a great distance, supposes this to be farther off than it
is, and consequently imagines it larger.][Footnote 81: This proposition, though undoubtedly intended to form a
part of some future work, which never was drawn up, makes no part of
the present.][Footnote 84: See chapter ccxcviii.][Footnote 85: This was probably to have been a part of some other work,
but it does not occur in this.][Footnote 86: Cento braccia, or cubits.The Florence braccio is one
foot ten inches seven eighths, English measure.][Footnote 87: Probably the Author here means yellow lilies, or fleurs
de lis.][Footnote 88: That point is always found in the horizon, and is called
the point of sight, or the vanishing point.][Footnote 91: This position has been already laid down in chapter
cxxiv.(and will also be found in chapter cccxlviii.); and the reader
is referred to the note on that passage, which will also explain that
in the text, for further illustration.It may, however, be proper to
remark, that though the author has here supposed both objects conveyed
to the eye by an angle of the same extent, they cannot, in fact, be so
seen, unless one eye be shut; and the reason is this: if viewed with
both eyes, there will be two points of sight, one in the centre of each
eye; and the rays from each of these to the objects must of course be
different, and will consequently form different angles.][Footnote 92: The braccio is one foot ten inches and seven eighths
English measure.]To be abridged according to the rules of
perspective.][Footnote 95: The whole of this chapter, like the next but one
preceding, depends on the circumstance of there being in fact two
points of sight, one in the centre of each eye, when an object is
viewed with both eyes.In natural objects the effect which this
circumstance produces is, that the rays from each point of sight,
diverging as they extend towards the object, take in not only that, but
some part also of the distance behind it, till at length, at a certain
distance behind it, they cross each other; whereas, in a painted
representation, there being no real distance behind the object, but the
whole being a flat surface, it is impossible that the rays from the
points of sight should pass beyond that flat surface; and as the object
itself is on that flat surface, which is the real extremity of the
view, the eyes cannot acquire a sight of any thing beyond.][Footnote 96: A well-known painter at Florence, contemporary with
Leonardo da Vinci, who painted several altar-pieces and other public
works.][Footnote 100: Leonardo da Vinci was remarkably fond of this kind of
invention, and is accused of having lost a great deal of time that way.][Footnote 101: The method here recommended, was the general and common
practice at that time, and continued so with little, if any variation,
till lately.But about thirty years ago, the late Mr.Bacon invented
an entirely new method, which, as better answering the purpose,
he constantly used, and from him others have also adopted it into
practice.][Footnote 102: This may be a good method of dividing the figure for the
purpose of reducing from large to small, or _vice versa_; but it not
being the method generally used by the painters for measuring their
figures, as being too minute, this chapter was not introduced amongst
those of general proportions.]why,
you can't think I would leave you, surely?"and, stooping down, the
brave little fellow caught Louie up in his arms, and, thus burdened,
tried to run on toward the house.The rest of the boys were now far beyond them; and had just placed their
feet upon the doorstone, when a loud shout of "help!"made them turn
round; and there was Freddy, with Louie in his arms, staggering up the
road, the horns of the bull within a yard of his side!Like a flash of lightning, Will snatched up a large rake which one of
the men had left lying on the grass, and dashed down the road.There is
one minute to spare, just one!but in that minute Will has reached the
spot, and launching his weapon, the iron points descend heavily on the
animal's head.The bull, rather aghast at this reception, which did not appear to be at
all to his taste, seemed to hesitate a moment whether to charge his
adversary or not; then, with a low growl of baffled fury, he slowly
turned away, and trotted off toward the wood.The help had not come a minute too soon; for Freddy, his sensitive
organization completely overwrought by the events of the morning and his
narrow escape from death, had fallen fainting to the ground; his hands
still clenched in the folds of little Louie's jacket.Will instantly
raised him, when he saw that all danger was over, and he and some of the
others, who had come crowding down the road, very gently and quickly
carried the insensible boy to the house, and laid him on the lounge in
the library; while Peter ran for the housekeeper to aid in bringing him
to life.Lockitt hurried up stairs as fast as she could with camphor,
ice water, and everything else she could think of good for fainting.asked Peter, as he ran on beside her."Gone to New York, Master Peter," she replied; "I don't think he will be
home before dinner time."Our little scapegrace breathed more freely; at least there were a few
hours' safety from detection, and he reentered the library feeling
considerably relieved.There lay Colonel Freddy, his face white as death; one little hand
hanging lax and pulseless over the side of the lounge, and the ruffled
shirt thrust aside from the broad, snowy chest.Harry stood over him,
fanning his forehead; while poor Louie was crouched in a corner,
sobbing as though his heart would break, and the others stood looking on
as if they did not know what to do with themselves.Lockitt hastened to apply her remedies; and soon a faint color came
back to the cheek, and with a long sigh, the great blue eyes opened once
more, and the little patient murmured, "Where am I?""Oh, then he's not killed, after all!"how glad I am you have come to life again!"This funny little speech made even Freddy laugh, and then Mrs.Lockitt
said, "But, Master Peter, you have not told me yet how it happened that
Master Frederic got in such a way."The eyes of the whole party became round and saucer-y at once; as, all
talking together, they began the history of their fearful adventure.Lockitt's wiry false curls would certainly have dropped off with
astonishment if they hadn't been sewed fast to her cap, and she fairly
wiped her eyes on her spectacle case, which she had taken out of her
pocket instead of her handkerchief, as they described Freddy's noble
effort to save his helpless companion without thinking of himself.When
the narrative was brought to a close, she could only exclaim, "Well,
Master Freddy, you are a little angel, sure enough!and Master William
is as brave as a lion.To think of his stopping that great creetur, to
be sure!Wherever in the world it came from is the mystery."Lockitt bustled out of the room, and after she had gone, there was
a very serious and grateful talk among the elder boys about the escape
they had had, and a sincere thankfulness to God for having preserved
their lives.The puzzle now was, how they were to return to the camp, where poor Tom
had been in captivity all this time.It was certainly necessary to get
back--but then the bull!While they were yet deliberating on the horns
of this dilemma, the library door suddenly opened, and in walked--Mr.he exclaimed, "how do you come to be here?There was general silence for a moment; but these boys had been taught
by pious parents to speak the truth always, whatever came of it.that is the right principle to go on, dear children; TELL THE TRUTH when
you have done anything wrong, even if you are sure of being punished
when that truth is known.So George, as the eldest, with one brave look at his comrades, frankly
related everything that had happened; beginning at the quarrel with
Tom, down to the escape from the bull.To describe the varied expression
of his auditor's face between delight and vexation, would require a
painter; and when George at last said, "Do you think we deserve to be
punished, sir?or have we paid well enough already for our court
martial?"Schermerhorn exclaimed, trying to appear highly incensed,
yet scarcely able to help smiling:

"I declare I hardly know!How
dare you treat a young gentleman so on my place?answer me that, you
scapegraces!It is pretty plain who is at the bottom of all this--Peter
dares not look at me, I perceive.At the same time, I am rather glad
that Master Tom has been taught what to expect if he runs down the
Union--it will probably save him from turning traitor any more, though
you were not the proper persons to pass sentence on him.As for our
plucky little Colonel here--shake hands, Freddy!and for your sake I excuse the court martial.Now, let us see what
has become of the bull, and then go to the release of our friend Tom.He
must be thoroughly repentant for his misdeeds by this time."Schermerhorn accordingly gave orders that the bull should be hunted
up and secured, until his master should be discovered; so that the
Zouaves might be safe from his attacks hereafter.If any of our readers
feel an interest in the fate of this charming animal, they are informed
that he was, with great difficulty, hunted into the stables; and before
evening taken away by his master, the farmer from whom he had strayed.Leaving the others to await his capture, let us return to Tom.He had
not been ten minutes in the smoke house before his wrath began to cool,
and he would have given sixpence for any way of getting out but by
begging pardon.That was a little too much just yet, and Tom stamped
with rage and shook the door; which resisted his utmost efforts to
burst.Then came the sounds without, the rushing, trampling steps, the
furious bellow, and the shout, "Run!and especially what would become of
him left alone there, with this unseen enemy perhaps coming at him next.He hunted in vain in every direction for some cranny to peep through;
and if it had been possible, would have squeezed his head up the
chimney.He shouted for help, but nobody heard him; they were all too
frightened for that.He could hear them crunching along the road,
presently; another cry, and then all was still.I'll f-fight for the
Union as m-much as you like!and at last--must it be
confessed?--the gallant Secesh finished by bursting out crying!Time passed on--of course seeming doubly long to the prisoner--and still
the boys did not return.Tom cried till he could cry no more; sniffling
desperately, and rubbing his nose violently up in the air--a proceeding
which did not ameliorate its natural bent in that direction.He really
felt thoroughly sorry, and quite ready to beg pardon as soon as the boys
should return; particularly as they had forgotten to provide the captive
with even the traditional bread and water, and dinner-time was close at
hand.While he was yet struggling between repentance and stomachache,
the welcome sound of their voices was heard.They came nearer, and then
a key was hastily applied to the fastenings of the door, and it flew
open, disclosing the Zouaves, with Freddy at the head, and Mr.Tom hung back a moment yet; then with a sudden impulse he walked toward
Freddy, saying, "I beg your pardon, Colonel; please forgive me for
insulting you; and as for the flag"--and without another word, Tom ran
toward the flag staff, and catching the long folds of the banner in both
hands, pressed them to his lips.it is your safeguard, and your countrymen's
too, if they would only believe it.Go and shake hands with him, boys;
he is in his right place now, and if ever you are tempted to quarrel
again, I am sure North and South will both remember

                            "BULL RUN!"IT is not necessary to describe the particular proceedings of the
Dashahed Zouaves during every day of their camp life.They chattered,
played, drilled, quarrelled a little once in a while, and made it up
again, eat and slept considerably, and grew sunburnt to an astonishing
degree.It was Thursday morning, the fourth of their delightful days in camp.Jerry had been teaching them how to handle a musket and charge
bayonets, until they were quite excited, and rather put out that there
was no enemy to practise on but the grasshoppers.At length, when they
had tried everything that was to be done, Harry exclaimed, "I wish,
Jerry, you would tell us a story about the wars!Something real
splendid, now; perfectly crammed with Indians and scalps and awful
battles and elegant Mexican palaces full of diamonds and gold saucepans
and lovely Spanish girls carried off by the hair of their heads!"This flourishing rigmarole, which Harry delivered regardless of stops,
made the boys shout with laughter."You'd better tell the story yourself, since you know so much about
it!""I allow you've never been in Mexico, sir," said Jerry, grinning."I
doubt but thar's palisses somewhar in Mexico, but I and my mates hev
been thar, an' _we_ never seed none o' 'em.No, Master Harry, I can't
tell ye sich stories as that, but I do mind a thing what happened on the
field afore Monterey."The boys, delightedly exclaiming, "A story!drew their
camp stools around him; and Jerry, after slowly rubbing his hand round
and round over his bristling chin, while he considered what to say
first, began his story as follows:


JERRY'S STORY."It wor a Sunday night, young genl'men, the 21st

          last my mate Bill says, says he, 'Jerry, my mate,
          hang me ef I can stan' this any longer.Let you
          an' me get up an' see ef it be cooler
          out-o'-doors.'"I wor tired enough wi' the day's fight, an'
          worrited, too, wi' a wound in my shoulder; but
          the tent wor no better nor the open field, an' we
          got up an' went out.Thar wor no moon, but the sky
          was wonderful full o' stars, so we could see how
          we wor stannin' wi' our feet among the bodies o'
          the poor fellows as had fired their last shot that
          day.It wor a sight, young genl'men, what would
          make sich as you sick an' faint to look on; but
          sogers must larn not to min' it; an' we stood
          thar, not thinkin' how awful it wor, and yet still
          an' quiet, too."'Ah, Jerry,' says Bill--he wor a young lad, an'
          brought up by a pious mother, I allow--'I dunnot
          like this fightin' on the Sabba' day.The Lord
          will not bless our arms, I'm afeard, if we go agin
          His will so.'"I laughed--more shame to me--an' said, 'I'm a
          sight older nor you, mate, an' I've seed a sight
          o' wictories got on a Sunday.The better the day,
          the better the deed, I reckon.'"'Well, I don't know,' he says;'mebbe things is
          allers mixed in time o' war, an' right an' wrong
          change sides a' purpose to suit them as wants
          battle an' tumult to be ragin'; but it don't go
          wi' my grain, noways.'"I hadn't experienced a change o' heart then, as I
          did arterward, bless the Lord!an' I hardly
          unnerstood what he said.While we wor a stannin'
          there, all to onct too dark figgers kim a creepin'
          over the field to'ard the Major's tent.'Look
          thar, Jerry,' whispered Bill, kind o' startin'
          like, 'thar's some of them rascally Mexicans.'I
          looked at 'em wi'out sayin' a wured, an' then I
          went back to the tent fur my six-shooter--Bill
          arter me;--fur ef it ain't the dooty o' every
          Christian to extarminate them warmints o'
          Mexicans, I'll be drummed out of the army
          to-morrer."Wall, young genl'men--we tuck our pistols, and
          slow and quiet we moved to whar we seed the two
          Greasers, as they call 'em.On they kim, creepin'
          to'ard my Major's tent, an' at las' one o' 'em
          raised the canwas a bit.Bill levelled his
          rewolver in a wink, an' fired.You shud ha' seed
          how they tuck to their heels!yelling all the way,
          till wun o' em' dropped.The other didn't stop,
          but just pulled ahead.I fired arter him wi'out
          touching him; but the noise woke the Major, an'
          when he hearn wot the matter wor, he ordered the
          alarm to be sounded an' the men turned out.'It's
          a 'buscade to catch us,' he says, 'an' I'm fur
          being fust on the field.'"Bill an' I buckled on our cartridge boxes, caught
          up our muskets, an' were soon in the ranks.On we
          marched, stiddy an' swift, to the enemy's
          fortifications; an' wen we were six hundred yards
          distant, kim the command, 'Double quick.'The sky
          hed clouded up all of a suddent, an' we couldn't
          see well where we wor, but thar was suthin' afore
          us like a low, black wall.As we kim nearer, it
          moved kind o' cautious like, an' when we wor
          within musket range, wi' a roar like ten thousand
          divils, they charged forred!Thar wor the flash
          and crack o' powder, and the ring!o' the
          bullets, as we power'd our shot on them an' they
          on us; but not another soun'; cr-r-r-ack went the
          muskets on every side agin, an' the rascals wor
          driven back a minnit.shouted
          the Major, wen he seed that.Thar wos a pause; a
          rush forred; we wor met by the innimy half way;
          an' then I hearn the awfullest o' created
          soun's--a man's scream.I looked roun', an' there
          wos Bill, lying on his face, struck through an'
          through.Thar wos no time to see to him then, fur
          the men wor fur ahead o' me, an' I hed to run an'
          jine the rest."We hed a sharp, quick skirmish o' it--for ef thar
          is a cowardly critter on the created airth it's a
          Greaser--an' in less nor half an' hour wor beatin'
          back to quarters.When all wor quiet agin, I left
          my tent, an' away to look fur Bill.I sarched an'
          sarched till my heart were almost broke, an at
          last I cried out, 'Oh Bill, my mate, whar be you?'an' I hearn a fibble v'ice say, 'Here I be,
          Jerry!'I wor gladder nor anything wen I hearn
          that.I hugged him to my heart, I wor moved so
          powerful, an' then I tuck him on my back, an' off
          to camp; werry slow an' patient, fur he were sore
          wownded, an' the life in him wery low."Wall, young genl'men, I'll not weary you wi' the
          long hours as dragged by afore mornin'.I med him
          as snug as I could, and at daybreak we hed him
          took to the sugeon's tent."I wor on guard all that mornin' an' could not get
          to my lad; but at last the relief kim roun', an'
          the man as was to take my place says, says he,
          'Jerry, my mate, ef I was you I'd go right to the
          hosp'tl an' stay by poor Bill' (fur they all knew
          as I sot gret store by him); 'He is werry wild in
          his head, I hearn, an' the sugeon says as how he
          can't last long.'"Ye may b'lieve how my hairt jumped wen I hearn
          that.I laid down my gun, an' ran fur the wooden
          shed, which were all the place they hed fur them
          as was wownded.An' thar wor Bill--my mate
          Bill--laying on a blanket spred on the floore, wi'
          his clothes all on (fur it's a hard bed, an' his
          own bloody uniform, that a sojer must die in), wi'
          the corpse o' another poor fellow as had died all
          alone in the night a'most touching him, an'
          slopped wi' blood.I moved it fur away all in a
          trimble o' sorrer, an' kivered it decent like, so
          as Bill mightn't see it an' get downhearted fur
          hisself.Then I went an' sot down aside my mate.He didn't know me, no more nor if I wor a
          stranger; but kept throwin' his arms about, an'
          moanin' out continual, 'Oh mother!Why
          don't you come to your boy?'"I bust right out crying, I do own, wen I hearn
          that, an' takin' his han' in mine, I tried to
          quiet him down a bit; telling him it wor bad fur
          his wownd to be so res'less (fur every time he
          tossed, thar kim a little leap o' blood from his
          breast); an' at last, about foore o'clock in the
          day, he opened his eyes quite sensible like, an'
          says to me, he says, 'Dear matey, is that you?Thank you fur coming to see me afore I die.'"'No, Bill, don't talk so,' I says, a strivin' to
          be cheerful like, tho' I seed death in his face,
          'You'll be well afore long.'"'Aye, well in heaven,' he says; and then, arter a
          minnit, 'Jerry,' he says, 'thar's a little bounty
          money as belongs to me in my knapsack, an' my
          month's wages.I want you, wen I am gone, to take
          it to my mother, an' tell her--'(he wor gaspin'
          fearful)--'as I died--fightin' fur my country--an'
          the flag.God bless you, Jerry--you hev been a
          good frien' to me, an' I knows as you'll do
          this--an' bid the boys good-by--fur me.'"I promised, wi' the tears streamin' down my
          cheeks; an' then we wor quiet a bit, fur it hurt
          Bill's breast to talk, an' I could not say a wured
          fur the choke in my throat.Arter a while he says,
          'Jerry, won't you sing me the hymn as I taught you
          aboard the transport?"I could hardly find v'ice to begin, but it wor
          Bill's dying wish, an' I made shift to sing as
          well as I could--

          "'We air marchin' on together
              To our etarnal rest;
           Niver askin' why we're ordered--
             For the Lord He knoweth best.is His word;
           Ranks all steady, muskets ready,
             In the army o' the Lord!"'Satan's hosts are all aroun' us,
             An' strive to enter in;
           But our outworks they are stronger
             Nor the dark brigades o' sin!Righteousness our sword;
           Truth the standard--in the vanguard--
             O' the army o' the Lord!"'Comrads, we air ever fightin'
             A battle fur the right;
           Ever on the on'ard movement
             Fur our home o' peace an' light.Heaven our reward,
          Comin' nearer, shinin' clearer--
             In the army o' the Lord!'"Arter I hed sung the hymn--an' it wor all I could
          do to get through--Bill seemed to be a sight
          easier.He lay still, smilin' like a child on the
          mother's breast.Pretty soon arter, the Major kim
          in; an' wen he seed Bill lookin' so peaceful, he
          says, says he, 'Why, cheer up, my lad!the sugeon
          sayd as how you wor in a bad way; but you look
          finely now;'--fur he didn't know it wor the death
          look coming over him.'You'll be about soon,'
          says the Major, 'an' fightin' fur the flag as
          brave as ever,'

          "Bill didn't say nothing--he seemed to be getting
          wild agin;--an' looked stupid like at our Major
          till he hearn the wureds about the flag.Then he
          caught his breath suddint like, an', afore we
          could stop him, he had sprang to his feet--shakin'
          to an' fro like a reed--but as straight as he ever
          wor on parade; an', his v'ice all hoarse an' full
          o' death, an' his arm in the air, he shouted,
          'Aye!we'll fight fur it
          till--' an' then we hearn a sort o' snap, an' he
          fell forred--dead!"We buried him that night, I an' my mates.I cut
          off a lock o' his hair fur his poor mother, afore
          we put the airth over him; an' giv it to her, wi'
          poor Bill's money, faithful an' true, wen we kim
          home.I've lived to be an old man since then, an'
          see the Major go afore me, as I hoped to sarve
          till my dyin' day; but Lord willing I shel go
          next, to win the Salwation as I've fitten for, by
          Bill's side, a sojer in Christ's army, in the
          Etarnal Jerusalem!"The boys took a long breath when Jerry had finished his story, and more
than one bright eye was filled with tears.The rough words, and plain,
unpolished manner of the old soldier, only heightened the impression
made by his story; and as he rose to go away, evidently much moved by
the painful recollections it excited, there was a hearty, "Thank you,
sergeant, for your story--it was real good!"Jerry only touched his cap
to the young soldiers, and marched off hastily, while the boys looked
after him in respectful silence.But young spirits soon recover from
gloomy influences, and in a few moments they were all chattering merrily
again."What a pity we must go home Monday!"cried Louie; "I wish we could camp
out forever!Oh, Freddy, do write a letter to General McClellan, and ask
him to let us join the army right away!Tell him we'll buy some new
india-rubber back-bones and stretch ourselves out big directly, if he'll
only send right on for us!""Perhaps he would, if he knew how jolly we can drill already!""I tell you what, boys, the very thing!let's have a
review before we go home.I'll ask all the boys and girls I know to come
and look on, and we might have quite a grand entertainment.We can march about all over, and fire off the cannons and
everything!"Yes, but how's General McClellan to hear anything about it?""Why--I don't know," said Peter, rather taken aback by this view of the
subject."Well, somehow--never mind, it will be grand fun, and I mean
to ask my father right away."Finally it was
concluded that it might make more impression on Mr.Schermerhorn's mind,
if the application came from the regiment in a body; so, running for
their swords and guns, officers and men found their places in the
battalion, and the grand procession started on its way--chattering all
the time, in utter defiance of that "article of war" which forbids
"talking in the ranks."Just as they were passing the lake, they heard
carriage wheels crunching on the gravel, and drew up in a long line on
the other side of the road to let the vehicle pass them; much to the
astonishment of two pretty young ladies and a sweet little girl, about
Freddy's age, who were leaning comfortably back in the handsome
barouche.exclaimed one of the ladies, "what in the world is all
this?"cried Peter, running up to the carriage, "why, these are the
Dashahed Zouaves, Miss Carlton.Good morning, Miss Jessie," to the little girl on the front seat, who
was looking on with deep interest."Oh, to be sure, I remember," said Miss Carlton, laughing; "come,
introduce the Zouaves, Peter; we are wild to know them!"The boys clustered eagerly about the carriage and a lively chat took
place.The Zouaves, some blushing and bashful, others frank and
confident, and all desperately in love already with pretty little
Jessie, related in high glee their adventures--except the celebrated
court martial--and enlarged glowingly upon the all-important subject of
the grand review.Colonel Freddy, of course, played a prominent part in all this, and with
his handsome face, bright eyes, and frank, gentlemanly ways, needed only
those poor lost curls to be a perfect picture of a soldier.He chattered
away with Miss Lucy, the second sister, and obtained her special promise
that she would plead their cause with Mr.Schermerhorn in case the
united petitions of the corps should fail.The young ladies did not know
of Mrs.Schermerhorn's departure, but Freddy and Peter together coaxed
them to come up to the house "anyhow."The carriage was accordingly
taken into the procession, and followed it meekly to the house; the
Zouaves insisting on being escort, much to the terror of the young
ladies; who were in constant apprehension that the rear rank and the
horses might come to kicks--not to say blows--and the embarrassment of
the coachman; who, as they were constantly stopping unexpectedly to turn
round and talk, didn't know "where to have them," as the saying is.However, they reached their destination in safety before long, and
found Mr.Schermerhorn seated on the piazza.He hastened forward to meet
them, with the cordial greeting of an old friend."Well, old bachelor," said Miss Carlton, gayly, as the young ladies
ascended the steps, "you see we have come to visit you in state, with
the military escort befitting patriotic young ladies who have four
brothers on the Potomac."Gone to Niagara and left me a 'lone lorn creetur;'" said Mr."Basely deserted me when my farming couldn't be
left.But how am I to account for the presence of the military,
mademoiselle?""Really, I beg their pardons," exclaimed Miss Carlton."They have come
on a special deputation to you, Mr.Schermerhorn, so pray don't let us
interrupt business."Thus apostrophised, the boys scampered eagerly up the steps; and Freddy,
a little bashful, but looking as bright as a button, delivered the
following brief oration: "Mr.Schermerhorn: I want--that is, the boys
want--I mean we all want--to have a grand review on Saturday, and ask
our friends to look on.Schermerhorn,
smiling; "but what will become of you good people when I tell you that
I have just received a letter from Mrs.Schermerhorn, asking me to join
her this week instead of next, and bring Peter with me."interrupted Peter; "can't you tell ma
I've joined the army for the war?"No, the army
must give you up, and lose a valuable member, Master Peter; but just
have the goodness to listen a moment.The review shall take place, but
as the camp will have to break up on Saturday instead of Monday, as I
had intended, the performances must come off to-morrow.The boys gave a delighted consent to this arrangement, and now the only
thing which dampened their enjoyment was the prospect of such a speedy
end being put to their camp life.what was the fun for a
fellow to be poked into a stupid watering place, where he must bother to
keep his hair parted down the middle, and a clean collar stiff enough to
choke him on from morning till night?"as Tom indignantly remarked to
George and Will the same evening."The fact is, this sort of thing is
_the_ thing for a _man_ after all!"an opinion in which the other _men_
fully concurred.But let us return to the piazza, where we have left the party.After a
few moments more spent in chatting with Mr.Schermerhorn, it was decided
to accept Colonel Freddy's polite invitation, which he gave with such a
bright little bow, to inspect the camp.You may be sure it was in
apple-pie order, for Jerry, who had taken the Zouaves under his special
charge, insisted on their keeping it in such a state of neatness as only
a soldier ever achieved.The party made an extremely picturesque
group--the gay uniforms of the Zouaves, and light summer dresses of the
ladies, charmingly relieved against the background of trees; while Mr.Schermerhorn's stately six feet, and somewhat portly proportions, quite
reminded one of General Scott; especially among such a small army; in
which George alone quite came up to the regulation "63 inches."Little Jessie ran hither and thither, surrounded by a crowd of adorers,
who would have given their brightest buttons, every "man" of them, to be
the most entertaining fellow of the corps.They showed her the battery
and the stacks of shining guns--made to stand up by Jerry in a wonderful
fashion that the boys never could hope to attain--the inside of all the
tents, and the smoke guard house (Tom couldn't help a blush as he looked
in); and finally, as a parting compliment (which, let me tell you, is
the greatest, in a boy's estimation, that can possibly be paid), Freddy
made her a present of his very largest and most gorgeous "glass agates;"
one of which was all the colors of the rainbow, and the other
patriotically adorned with the Stars and Stripes in enamel.Peter
climbed to the top of the tallest cherry tree, and brought her down a
bough at least a yard and a half long, crammed with "ox hearts;" Harry
eagerly offered to make any number of "stunning baskets" out of the
stones, and in short there never was such a belle seen before."Oh, a'int she jolly!"was the ruling opinion among the Zouaves.A
private remark was also circulated to the effect that "Miss Jessie was
stunningly pretty."The young ladies at last said good-by to the camp; promising faithfully
to send all the visitors they could to the grand review, and drove off
highly entertained with their visit.Schermerhorn decided to take
the afternoon boat for the city and return early Friday morning, and the
boys, left to themselves, began to think of dinner, as it was two
o'clock.A brisk discussion was kept up all dinner time you may be sure,
concerning the event to come off on the morrow."I should like to know, for my part, what we do in a review," said
Jimmy, balancing his fork artistically on the end of his finger, and
looking solemnly round the table."March about,
and form into ranks and columns, and all that first, then do charming
"parade rest," "'der humps!"and the rest of it; and finish off by
firing off our guns, and showing how we can't hit anything by any
possibility!""But I'm sure father won't let us have any powder," said Peter
disconsolately."You can't think how I burnt the end of my nose last
Fourth with powder!It was so sore I couldn't blow it for a week!"The boys all burst out laughing at this dreadful disaster, and George
said, "You weren't lighting it with the end of your nose, were you?""No; but I was stooping over, charging one of my cannon, and I dropped
the 'punk' right in the muzzle somehow, and, would you believe it, the
nasty thing went off and burnt my nose!and father said I shouldn't play
with powder any more, because I might have put out my eyes.""Well, we must take it out in marching, then," said Freddy, with a
tremendous sigh."No, hold on; I'll tell you what we can do!""I have
some 'double headers' left from the Fourth; we might fire them out of
the cannon; they make noise enough, I'm sure.I'll write to my mother
this afternoon and get them."The boys couldn't help being struck with the generosity of this offer,
coming from Tom after their late rather unkind treatment of him; and the
older ones especially were very particular to thank him for his present.As soon as dinner was over, he started for the house to ask Mr.As he hurried along the road, his
bright black eyes sparkling with the happiness of doing a good action,
he heard trotting steps behind him, felt an arm stealing round his neck,
schoolboy fashion, and there was Freddy."I ran after you all the way," he pantingly said."I want to tell you,
dear Tom, how much we are obliged to you for giving us your crackers,
and how sorry we are that we acted so rudely to you the other day.Please forgive us; we all like you so much, and we would feel as mean as
anything to take your present without begging pardon.George, Peter, and
I feel truly ashamed of ourselves every time we think of that abominable
court martial.""There, old fellow, don't say a word more about it!"was the hearty
response; and Tom threw his arm affectionately about his companion."It
was my fault, Freddy, and all because I was mad at poor old Jerry; how
silly!I was sorry for what I said right afterward.""Yes; I'll like you as long as I live!And so
we will leave the two on their walk to the house, and close this
abominably long chapter.THERE are really scarcely words enough in the dictionary properly to
describe the immense amount of drill got through with by the Dashahed
Zouaves between three o'clock that afternoon and twelve, noon, of the
following day.This Friday afternoon was going to be memorable in
history for one of the most splendid reviews on record.They almost ran
poor old Jerry off his legs in their eagerness to go over every possible
variety of exercise known to "Hardee's Tactics," and nearly dislocated
their shoulder blades trying to waggle their elbows backward and forward
all at once when they went at "double quick;" at the same time keeping
the other arm immovably pinioned to their sides.Then that wonderful
operation of stacking the rebellious guns, which obstinately clattered
down nine times and a half out of ten, had to be gone through with, and
a special understanding promulgated in the corps as to when Jerry's
"'der arms!"meant "shoulder arms," and when "order arms" (or bringing
all the muskets down together with a bang); and, in short, there never
was such a busy time seen in camp before.Friday morning dawned, if possible, still more splendidly than any of
the preceding days, with a cool, refreshing breeze, just enough snowy
clouds in the sky to keep off the fiery summer heat in a measure, and
not a headache nor a heartache among the Zouaves to mar the pleasure of
the day.The review was to come off at four o'clock, when the July sun
would be somewhat diminished in warmth, and from some hints that Jerry
let fall, Mrs.Lockitt, and the fat cook, Mrs.Mincemeat, were holding
high council up at the house, over a certain collation to be partaken of
at the end of the entertainments.As the day wore on the excitement of our friends the Zouaves increased.They could hardly either eat their dinners, or sit down for more than a
moment at a time; and when, about three o'clock, Mr.Schermerhorn
entered the busy little camp, he was surrounded directly with a crowd of
eager questioners, all talking at once, and making as much noise as a
colony of rooks."Patience, patience, my good friends!"Schermerhorn, holding
up a finger for silence.Tom, here are your 'double
headers,' with love from your mother.Fred, I saw your father to-day,
and they are all coming down to the review.George, here is a note left
for you in my box at the Post Office, and Dashahed Zouaves in
general--I have one piece of advice to give you.Get dressed quietly,
and then sit down and rest yourselves.You will be tired out by the end
of the afternoon, at all events; so don't frisk about more than you can
help at present;" and Mr.Schermerhorn left the camp; while the boys,
under strong pressure of Jerry, and the distant notes of a band which
suddenly began to make itself heard, dressed themselves as nicely as
they could, and sat down with heroic determination to wait for four
o'clock.Presently, carriages began to crunch over the gravel road one after
another, filled with merry children, and not a few grown people besides.Jourdain, with Bella, were among the first to arrive; and
soon after the Carltons' barouche drove up.Jessie, for some unknown
reason, was full of half nervous glee, and broke into innumerable little
trilling laughs when any one spoke to her.A sheet of lilac note paper,
folded up tight, which she held in her hand, seemed to have something to
do with it, and her soft brown curls and spreading muslin skirts were in
equal danger of irremediable "mussing," as she fidgetted about on the
carriage seat, fully as restless as any of the Zouaves.Schermerhorn received his guests on the piazza, where all the chairs
in the house, one would think, were placed for the company, as the best
view of the lawn was from this point.To the extreme right were the
white tents of the camp, half hidden by the immense trunk of a
magnificent elm, the only tree that broke the smooth expanse of the
lawn.On the left a thick hawthorne hedge separated the ornamental
grounds from the cultivated fields of the place, while in front the view
was bounded by the blue and sparkling waters of the Sound.Soon four o'clock struck; and, punctual to the moment, the Zouaves could
be seen in the distance, forming their ranks.Jerry, in his newest suit
of regimentals, bustled about here and there, and presently his voice
was heard shouting, "Are ye all ready now?and to
the melodious notes of "Dixie," performed by the band, which was
stationed nearer the house, the regiment started up the lawn!Jerry
marching up beside them, and occasionally uttering such mysterious
mandates as, "Easy in the centre!Oh, what a burst of delighted applause greeted them as they neared the
house!The boys hurrahed, the girls clapped their hands, ladies and
gentlemen waved their hats and handkerchiefs; while the Dashahed
Zouaves, too soldierly _now_ to grin, drew up in a long line, and stood
like statues, without so much as winking.And now the music died away, and everybody was as still as a mouse,
while Jerry advanced to the front, and issued the preliminary order:

"To the rear--open order!"and the rear rank straightway fell back;
executing, in fact, that wonderful "tekkinapesstoth'rare" which had
puzzled them so much on the first day of their drilling.Then came those
other wonderful orders:

          "P'_sent_ humps!And so on, at which the muskets flew backward and forward, up and down,
with such wonderful precision.The spectators were delighted beyond
measure; an enthusiastic young gentleman, with about three hairs on
each side of his mustache, who belonged to the Twenty-second Regiment,
declared "It was the best drill he had seen out of his company room!"a
celebrated artist, whose name I dare not tell for the world, sharpened
his pencil, and broke the point off three times in his hurry, and at
last produced the beautiful sketch which appears at the front of this
volume; while all the little boys who were looking on, felt as if they
would give every one of their new boots and glass agates to belong to
the gallant Dashahed Zouaves.[Illustration: "DOUBLE-QUICK."]After the guns had been put in every possible variety of position, the
regiment went through their marching.They broke into companies,
formed the line again, divided in two equal parts, called "breaking into
platoons," showed how to "wheel on the right flank," and all manner of
other mysteries.Finally, they returned to their companies, and on Jerry's giving the
order, they started at "double quick" (which is the most comical
tritty-trot movement you can think of), dashed down the <DW72> of the
lawn, round the great elm, up hill again full speed, and in a moment
more were drawn up in unbroken lines before the house, and standing once
again like so many statues.Round after round of applause greeted the
Zouaves, who kept their positions for a moment, then snatching off
their saucy little fez caps, they gave the company three cheers in
return, of the most tremendous description; which quite took away the
little remaining breath they had after the "double quick."Thus ended the first part of the review; and now, with the assistance of
their rather Lilliputian battery, and Tom's double headers, they went
through some firing quite loud enough to make the little girls start and
jump uncomfortably; so this part of the entertainment was brought to
rather a sudden conclusion.Jerry had just issued the order, "Close up
in ranks to dismiss," when Mr.Schermerhorn, who, with Miss Carlton and
Jessie, had left the piazza a few minutes before, came forward, saying,
"Have the goodness to wait a moment, Colonel; there is one more ceremony
to go through with."The boys looked at each other in silent curiosity, wondering what could
be coming; when, all at once, the chairs on the piazza huddled back in a
great hurry, to make a lane for a beautiful little figure, which came
tripping from the open door.It was Jessie; but a great change had been made in her appearance.Over
her snowy muslin skirts she had a short classic tunic of red, white, and
blue silk; a wreath of red and white roses and bright blue jonquils
encircled her curls, and in her hand she carried a superb banner.It
was made of dark blue silk, trimmed with gold fringe; on one side was
painted an American eagle, and on the other the words "Dashahed
Zouaves," surrounded with a blaze of glory and gold stars.She advanced
to the edge of the piazza, and in a clear, sweet voice, a little
tremulous, but very distinct, she said:

          "COLONEL AND BRAVE SOLDIERS:

          "I congratulate you, in the name of our friends,
          on the success you have achieved.You have shown
          us to-day what Young America can do; and as a
          testimonial of our high admiration, I present you
          the colors of your regiment!"Take them, as the assurance that our hearts are
          with you; bear them as the symbol of the Cause you
          have enlisted under; and should you fall beneath
          them on the field of battle, I bid you lay down
          your lives cheerfully for the flag of your
          country, and breathe with your last sigh the name
          of the Union!Freddy's cheeks grew crimson, and the great tears swelled to his eyes as
he advanced to take the flag which Jessie held toward him.And now our
little Colonel came out bright, sure enough.Perhaps not another member
of the regiment, called upon to make a speech in this way, could have
thought of a word to reply; but Freddy's quick wit supplied him with
the right ideas; and it was with a proud, happy face, and clear voice
that he responded:

          "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:

          "I thank you, in the name of my regiment, for the
          honor you have done us.Inspired by your praises,
          proud to belong to the army of the Republic, we
          hope to go on as we have begun.To your kindness
          we owe the distinguishing colors under which we
          march hereafter; and by the Union for which we
          fight, they shall never float over a retreating
          battalion!"the cheers and clapping of hands which followed this little speech!Everybody was looking at Freddy as he stood there, the colors in his
hand, and the bright flush on his cheek, with the greatest admiration.Of course, his parents weren't proud of him; certainly not!But the wonders were not at an end yet; for suddenly the band began
playing a new air, and to this accompaniment, the sweet voice of some
lady unseen, but which sounded to those who knew, wonderfully like Miss
Lucy Carlton's, sang the following patriotic ballad:

          "We will stand by our Flag--let it lead where it will--
          Our hearts and our hopes fondly cling to it still;
          Through battle and danger our Cause must be won--
          Yet forward!still unsullied and bright,
          As when first its fair stars lit oppression's dark night
          And the standard that guides us forever shall be
          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"A handful of living--an army of dead,
          The last charge been made and the last prayer been said;
          What is it--as sad we retreat from the plain
          That cheers us, and nerves us to rally again?to our country God-given,
          That gleams through our ranks like a glory from heaven!And the foe, as they fly, in our vanguard shall see
          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"We will fight for the Flag, by the love that we bear
          In the Union and Freedom, we'll baffle despair;
          Trust on in our country, strike home for the right,
          And Treason shall vanish like mists of the night.every star in it glows,
          The terror of traitors!And the victory that crowns us shall glorified be,
          'Neath the Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"As the song ended, there was another tumult of applause; and then the
band struck up a lively quickstep, and the company, with the Zouaves
marching ahead, poured out on the lawn toward the camp, where a
bountiful collation was awaiting them, spread on the regimental table.Two splendid pyramids of flowers ornamented the centre, and all manner
of "goodies," as the children call them, occupied every inch of space on
the sides.At the head of the table Jerry had contrived a canopy from a
large flag, and underneath this, Miss Jessie, Colonel Freddy, with the
other officers, and some favored young ladies of their own age, took
their seats.The other children found places around the table, and a
merrier fete champetre never was seen.The band continued to play lively
airs from time to time, and I really can give you my word as an author,
that nobody looked cross for a single minute!Between you and me, little reader, there had been a secret arrangement
among the grown folks interested in the regiment, to get all this up in
such fine style.Every one had contributed something to give the Zouaves
their flag and music, while to Mr.Schermerhorn it fell to supply the
supper; and arrangements had been made and invitations issued since the
beginning of the week.The regiment, certainly, had the credit, however,
of getting up the review, it only having been the idea of their good
friends to have the entertainment and flag presentation.So there was a
pleasant surprise on both sides; and each party in the transaction, was
quite as much astonished and delighted as the other could wish.The long sunset shadows were rapidly stealing over the velvet sward as
the company rose from table, adding a new charm to the beauty of the
scene.Everywhere the grass was dotted with groups of elegant ladies and
gentlemen, and merry children, in light summer dresses and quaintly
pretty uniforms.The little camp, with the stacks of guns down its
centre, the bayonets flashing in the last rays of the sun, was all
crowded and brilliant with happy people; looking into the tents and
admiring their exquisite order, inspecting the bright muskets, and
listening eagerly or good-humoredly, as they happened to be children or
grown people, to the explanations and comments of the Zouaves.And on the little grassy knoll, where the flag staff was planted,
central figure of the scene, stood Colonel Freddy, silent and thoughtful
for the first time to-day, with Jerry beside him.The old man had
scarcely left his side since the boy took the flag; he would permit no
one else to wait upon him at table, and his eyes followed him as he
moved among the gay crowd, with a glance of the utmost pride and
affection.The old volunteer seemed to feel that the heart of a soldier
beat beneath the little dandy ruffled shirt and gold-laced jacket of the
young Colonel.Suddenly, the boy snatches up again the regimental
colors; the Stars and Stripes, and little Jessie's flag, and shakes
them out to the evening breeze; and as they flash into view and once
more the cheers of the Zouaves greet their colors, he says, with
quivering lip and flashing eye, "Jerry, if God spares me to be a man,
I'll live and die a soldier!"The soft evening light was deepening into night, and the beautiful
planet Venus rising in the west, when the visitors bade adieu to the
camp; the Zouaves were shaken hands with until their wrists fairly
ached; and then they all shook hands with "dear" Jessie, as Charley was
heard to call her before the end of the day, and heard her say in her
soft little voice how sorry she was they must go to-morrow (though she
certainly couldn't have been sorrier than _they_ were), and then the
good people all got into their carriages again, and drove off; waving
their handkerchiefs for good-by as long as the camp could be seen; and
so, with the sound of the last wheels dying away in the distance, ended
the very end of

                                THE GRAND REVIEW.AND now, at last, had come that "day of disaster," when Camp McClellan
must be deserted.The very sun didn't shine so brilliantly as usual,
thought the Zouaves; and it was positively certain that the past five
days, although they had occurred in the middle of summer, were the very
shortest ever known!Eleven o'clock was the hour appointed for the
breaking up of the camp, in order that they might return to the city by
the early afternoon boat."Is it possible we have been here a week?"exclaimed Jimmy, as he sat
down to breakfast."It seems as if we had only come yesterday.""What a jolly time it has been!""I don't want
to go to Newport a bit."To Baltimore--but I don't mean to Secesh!"added Tom, with a little
blush."I have a cousin in the Palmetto Guards at Charleston, and that's
one too many rebels in the family."cried George Chadwick; "the Pringles are a first rate
family; the rest of you are loyal enough, I'm sure!"and George gave
Tom such a slap on the back, in token of his good will, that it quite
brought the tears into his eyes.When breakfast was over, the Zouaves repaired to their tents, and
proceeded to pack their clothes away out of the lockers.They were not
very scientific packers, and, in fact, the usual mode of doing the
business was to ram everything higgledy-piggledy into their valises, and
then jump on them until they consented to come together and be locked.Presently Jerry came trotting down with a donkey cart used on the farm,
and under his directions the boys folded their blankets neatly up, and
placed them in the vehicle, which then drove off with its load, leaving
them to get out and pile together the other furnishings of the tents;
for, of course, as soldiers, they were expected to wind up their own
affairs, and we all know that boys will do considerable _hard work_ when
it comes in the form of _play_.Just as the cart, with its vicious
little wrong-headed steed, had tugged, and jerked, and worried itself
out of sight, a light basket carriage, drawn by two dashing black
Canadian ponies, drew up opposite the camp, and the reins were let fall
by a young lady in a saucy "pork pie" straw hat, who was driving--no
other than Miss Carlton, with Jessie beside her.The boys eagerly
surrounded the little carriage, and Miss Carlton said, laughing, "Jessie
begged so hard for a last look at the camp, that I had to bring her."Really," repeated Freddy; "but I am so glad you came, Miss Jessie, just
in time to see us off.""You know soldiers take themselves away houses and all," said George;
"you will see the tents come down with a run presently."As he spoke, the donkey
cart rattled up, and Jerry, touching his cap to the ladies, got out, and
prepared to superintend the downfall of the tents.By his directions,
two of the Zouaves went to each tent, and pulled the stakes first from
one corner, then the other; then they grasped firmly the pole which
supported the centre, and when the sergeant ejaculated "Now!"the tents slid smoothly to the ground all at the same moment,
just as you may have made a row of blocks fall down by upsetting the
first one.And now came the last ceremony, the hauling down of the flag.shouted Jerry, and instantly a company was
detached, who brought the six little cannon under the flagstaff, and
charged them with the last of the double headers, saved for this
purpose; Freddy stood close to the flagstaff, with the halyards ready in
his hands.and the folds of the flag stream out proudly in the breeze, as it
rapidly descends the halyards, and flutters softly to the greensward.There was perfectly dead silence for a moment; then the voice of Mr.Schermerhorn was heard calling, "Come, boys, are you ready?Jump in,
then, it is time to start for the boat."The boys turned and saw the
carriages which had brought them so merrily to the camp waiting to
convey them once more to the wharf; while a man belonging to the farm
was rapidly piling the regimental luggage into a wagon.With sorrowful faces the Zouaves clustered around the pretty pony
chaise; shaking hands once more with Jessie, and internally vowing to
adore her as long as they lived.Then they got into the carriages, and
old Jerry grasped Freddy's hand with an affectionate "Good-by, my little
Colonel, God bless ye!Old Jerry won't never forget your noble face as
long as he lives."It would have seemed like insulting the old man to
offer him money in return for his loving admiration, but the handsome
gilt-edged Bible that found its way to him soon after the departure of
the regiment, was inscribed with the irregular schoolboy signature of
"Freddy Jourdain, with love to his old friend Jeremiah Pike."As for the regimental standards, they were found to be rather beyond
the capacity of a rockaway crammed full of Zouaves, so Tom insisted on
riding on top of the baggage, that he might have the pleasure of
carrying them all the way.Up he mounted, as brisk as a lamplighter,
with that monkey, Peter, after him, the flags were handed up, and with
three ringing cheers, the vehicles started at a rapid trot, and the
regiment was fairly off.They almost broke their necks leaning back to
see the last of "dear Jessie," until the locusts hid them from sight,
when they relapsed into somewhat dismal silence for full five minutes.As Peter was going on to Niagara with his father, Mr.Schermerhorn
accompanied the regiment to the city, which looked dustier and red
brickier (what a word!)than ever, now that they were fresh from the
lovely green of the country.Schermerhorn's advice, the party
took possession of two empty Fifth avenue stages which happened to be
waiting at the Fulton ferry, and rode slowly up Broadway to Chambers
street, where Peter and his father bid them good-by, and went off to the
depot.As Peter had declined changing his clothes before he left, they
had to travel all the way to Buffalo with our young friend in this
unusual guise; but, as people had become used to seeing soldiers
parading about in uniform, they didn't seem particularly surprised,
whereat Master Peter was rather disappointed.To go back to the Zouaves, however.When the stages turned into Fifth
avenue, they decided to get out; and after forming their ranks in fine
style, they marched up the avenue, on the sidewalk this time, stopping
at the various houses or street corners where they must bid adieu to one
and another of their number, promising to see each other again as soon
as possible.At last only Tom and Freddy were left to go home by themselves.As they
marched along, keeping faultless step, Freddy exclaimed, "I tell you
what, Tom!I mean to ask my father, the minute he comes home, to let me
go to West Point as soon as I leave school!I must be a soldier--I
can't think of anything else!""That's just what I mean to do!"cried Tom, with sparkling eyes; "and,
Fred, if you get promoted before me, promise you will have me in your
regiment, won't you?"answered Freddy; "but you're the oldest, Tom,
and, you know, the oldest gets promoted first; so mind you don't forget
me when you come to your command!"As he spoke, they reached his own home; and our hero, glad after all to
come back to father, mother, and sister, bounded up the steps, and rang
the bell good and _hard_, just to let Joseph know that a personage of
eminence had arrived.As the door opened, he turned gayly round, cap in
hand, saying, "Good-by, Maryland; you've left the regiment, but you'll
never leave the Union!"and the last words he heard Tom say were, "No,
by George, _never_!"*       *       *       *       *

And now, dear little readers, my boy friends in particular, the history
of Freddy Jourdain must close.He still lives in New York, and attends
Dr.Larned's school, where he is at the head of all his classes.The Dashahed Zouaves have met very often since the encampment, and had
many a good drill in their room--the large attic floor which Mr.Jourdain allowed them for their special accommodation, and where the
beautiful regimental colors are carefully kept, to be proudly displayed
in every parade of the Zouaves.When he is sixteen, the boy Colonel is to enter West Point Academy, and
learn to be a real soldier; while Tom--poor Tom, who went down to
Baltimore that pleasant July month, promising so faithfully to join
Freddy in the cadet corps, may never see the North again.And in conclusion let me say, that should our country again be in danger
in after years, which God forbid, we may be sure that first in the
field, and foremost in the van of the grand army, will be our gallant
young friend,

                                 COLONEL FREDDY.IT took a great many Saturday afternoons to finish the story of "Colonel
Freddy," and the children returned to it at each reading with renewed
and breathless interest.George and Helen couldn't help jumping up off
their seats once or twice and clapping their hands with delight when
anything specially exciting took place in the pages of the wonderful
story that was seen "before it was printed," and a great many "oh's" and
"ah's" testified to their appreciation of the gallant "Dashahed
Zouaves."They laughed over the captive Tom, and cried over the true
story of the old sergeant; and when at length the very last word had
been read, and their mother had laid down the manuscript, George sprang
up once more, exclaiming; "Oh, I wish I could be a boy soldier!Mamma,
mayn't I recruit a regiment and camp out too?"cried his sister; "I wish I had been Jessie; what a
pity it wasn't all true!""And what if I should tell you," said their mother, laughing, "that a
little bird has whispered in my ear that 'Colonel Freddy' was
wonderfully like your little Long Island friend Hilton R----?""Oh, something funny I heard about him last summer; never mind what!"The children wisely concluded that it was no use to ask any more
questions; at the same moment solemnly resolving that the very next time
they paid a visit to their aunt, who lived at Astoria, they would beg
her to let them drive over to Mr.R----'s place, and find out all about
it.After this, there were no more readings for several Saturdays; but at
last one morning when the children had almost given up all hopes of more
stories, George opened his eyes on the sock hanging against the door,
which looked more bulgy than ever.he shouted; "Aunt Fanny's
daughter hasn't forgotten us, after all!"and dressing himself in a
double quick, helter-skelter fashion, George dashed out into the entry,
forgot his good resolution, and slid down the banisters like a streak of
lightning and began pummelling on his sister's door with both fists;
shouting, "Come, get up!here's another Sock story for
us!"This delightful announcement was quite sufficient to make Helen's
stockings, which she was just drawing on in a lazy fashion, fly up to
their places in a hurry; then she popped her button-over boots on the
wrong feet, and had to take them off and try again; and, in short, the
whole of her dressing was an excellent illustration of that time-honored
maxim, "The more _haste_, the worse _speed_;" George, meanwhile,
performing a distracted Indian war dance in the entry outside, until his
father opened his door and wanted to know what the racket was all about.At this moment Helen came out, and the two children scampered down
stairs, and sitting down side by side on the sofa, they proceeded to
examine this second instalment of the Sock stories.They found it was
again a whole book; and the title, on a little page by itself, read
"GERMAN SOCKS.""These must be more stories like that
dear 'Little White Angel.'"And so they proved to be; for, on their mother's commencing to read the
first story, it was found to be called, "God's Pensioners;" and
commenced, "It was a cold--" but stop!This book was to be devoted
to "Colonel Freddy;" but if you will only go to Mr.Leavitt's, the
publishers, you will there discover what was the rest of the second Sock
Stories.*       *       *       *       *

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Red, White, Blue Socks.At Hatfield we bayted and walked
into the great house through all the courts; and I would fain have stolen
a pretty dog that followed me, but I could not, which troubled me.To
horse again, and by degrees with much ado got to London, where I found all
well at home and at my father's and my Lady's, but no news yet from my
Lord where he is.At my Lady's (whither I went with Dean Fuller, who came
to my house to see me just as I was come home) I met with Mr.Moore, who
told me at what a loss he was for me, for to-morrow is a Seal day at the
Privy Seal, and it being my month, I am to wait upon my Lord Roberts, Lord
Privy Seal, at the Seal.Early in the mornink to Whitehall, but my Lord Privy Seal came not
all the morning.Moore and I to the Wardrobe to dinner, where
my Lady and all merry and well.Back again to the Privy Seal; but my Lord
comes not all the afternoon, which made me mad and gives all the world
reason to talk of his delaying of business, as well as of his severity and
ill using of the Clerks of the Privy Seal.Pierce's brother (the souldier) to the tavern
next the Savoy, and there staid and drank with them.Mage, and discoursing of musique Mons.Eschar spoke so much against the
English and in praise of the French that made him mad, and so he went
away.After a stay with them a little longer we parted and I home.To the office, where word is brought me by a son-in-law of Mr.Pierces; the purser, that his father is a dying and that he desires that I
would come to him before he dies.So I rose from the table and went,
where I found him not so ill as I thought that he had been ill.So I did
promise to be a friend to his wife and family if he should die, which was
all he desired of me, but I do believe he will recover.Back again to the
office, where I found Sir G. Carteret had a day or two ago invited some of
the officers to dinner to-day at Deptford.So at noon, when I heard that
he was a-coming, I went out, because I would see whether he would send to
me or no to go with them; but he did not, which do a little trouble me
till I see how it comes to pass.Although in other things I am glad of it
because of my going again to-day to the Privy Seal.I dined at home, and
having dined news is brought by Mr.Hater that his wife is now falling
into labour, so he is come for my wife, who presently went with him.I to
White Hall, where, after four o'clock, comes my Lord Privy Seal, and so we
went up to his chamber over the gate at White Hall, where he asked me what
deputacon I had from My Lord.I told him none; but that I am sworn my
Lord's deputy by both of the Secretarys, which did satisfy him.Moore to read over all the bills as is the manner, and all
ended very well.So that I see the Lyon is not so fierce as he is
painted.Eschar (who all this afternoon had been
waiting at the Privy Seal for the Warrant for L5,000 for my Lord of
Sandwich's preparation for Portugal) and I took some wine with us and went
to visit la belle Pierce, who we find very big with child, and a pretty
lady, one Mrs.Clifford, with her, where we staid and were extraordinary
merry.From thence I took coach to my father's, where I found him come
home this day from Brampton (as I expected) very well, and after some
discourse about business and it being very late I took coach again home,
where I hear by my wife that Mrs.Hater is not yet delivered, but
continues in her pains.This morning came the maid that my wife hath lately hired for a
chamber maid.She is very ugly, so that I cannot care for her, but
otherwise she seems very good.But however she do come about three weeks
hence, when my wife comes back from Brampton, if she go with my father.By
and by came my father to my house, and so he and I went and found out my
uncle Wight at the Coffee House, and there did agree with him to meet the
next week with my uncle Thomas and read over the Captain's will before
them both for their satisfaction.Having done with him I went to my
Lady's and dined with her, and after dinner took the two young gentlemen
and the two ladies and carried them and Captain Ferrers to the Theatre,
and shewed them "The merry Devill of Edmunton," which is a very merry
play, the first time I ever saw it, which pleased me well.And that being
done I took them all home by coach to my house and there gave them fruit
to eat and wine.So by water home with them, and so home myself.To our own church in the forenoon, and in the
afternoon to Clerkenwell Church, only to see the two

come home with not above two or three able to keep pace with him.So to
my father's, and there supped, and so home.At home in the afternoon, and had
notice that my Lord Hinchingbroke is fallen ill, which I fear is with the
fruit that I did give them on Saturday last at my house: so in the evening
I went thither and there found him very ill, and in great fear of the
smallpox.I supped with my Lady, and did consult about him, but we find
it best to let him lie where he do; and so I went home with my heart full
of trouble for my Lord Hinchinabroke's sickness, and more for my Lord
Sandwich's himself, whom we are now confirmed is sick ashore at Alicante,
who, if he should miscarry, God knows in what condition would his family
be.I dined to-day with my Lord Crew, who is now at Sir H. Wright's,
while his new house is making fit for him, and he is much troubled also at
these things.To the Privy Seal in the morning, then to the Wardrobe to dinner,
where I met my wife, and found my young Lord very ill.So my Lady intends
to send her other three sons, Sidney, Oliver, and John, to my house, for
fear of the small-pox.After dinner I went to my father's, where I found
him within, and went up to him, and there found him settling his papers
against his removal, and I took some old papers of difference between me
and my wife and took them away.After that Pall being there I spoke to my
father about my intention not to keep her longer for such and such
reasons, which troubled him and me also, and had like to have come to some
high words between my mother and me, who is become a very simple woman.Cordery to take her leave of my father, thinking
he was to go presently into the country, and will have us to come and see
her before he do go.Then my father and I went forth to Mr.Rawlinson's,
where afterwards comes my uncle Thomas and his two sons, and then my uncle
Wight by appointment of us all, and there we read the will and told them
how things are, and what our thoughts are of kindness to my uncle Thomas
if he do carry himself peaceable, but otherwise if he persist to keep his
caveat up against us.So he promised to withdraw it, and seemed to be
very well contented with things as they are.After a while drinking, we
paid all and parted, and so I home, and there found my Lady's three sons
come, of which I am glad that I am in condition to do her and my Lord any
service in this kind, but my mind is yet very much troubled about my Lord
of Sandwich's health, which I am afeard of.This morning Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen and I, waited upon the
Duke of York in his chamber, to give him an account of the condition of
the Navy for lack of money, and how our own very bills are offered upon
the Exchange, to be sold at 20 in the 100 loss.He is much troubled at
it, and will speak to the King and Council of it this morning.So I went
to my Lady's and dined with her, and found my Lord Hinchingbroke somewhat
better.After dinner Captain Ferrers and I to the Theatre, and there saw
"The Alchymist;" and there I saw Sir W. Pen, who took us when the play was
done and carried the Captain to Paul's and set him down, and me home with
him, and he and I to the Dolphin, but not finding Sir W. Batten there, we
went and carried a bottle of wine to his house, and there sat a while and
talked, and so home to bed.Creed of
the 15th of July last, that tells me that my Lord is rid of his pain
(which was wind got into the muscles of his right side) and his feaver,
and is now in hopes to go aboard in a day or two, which do give me mighty
great comfort.To the Privy Seal and Whitehall, up and down, and at noon Sir W.
Pen carried me to Paul's, and so I walked to the Wardrobe and dined with
my Lady, and there told her, of my Lord's sickness (of which though it
hath been the town-talk this fortnight, she had heard nothing) and
recovery, of which she was glad, though hardly persuaded of the latter.I
found my Lord Hinchingbroke better and better, and the worst past.Thence
to the Opera, which begins again to-day with "The Witts," never acted yet
with scenes; and the King and Duke and Duchess were there (who dined
to-day with Sir H. Finch, reader at the Temple, in great state); and
indeed it is a most excellent play, and admirable scenes.So home and was
overtaken by Sir W. Pen in his coach, who has been this afternoon with my
Lady Batten, &c., at the Theatre.So I followed him to the Dolphin, where
Sir W. Batten was, and there we sat awhile, and so home after we had made
shift to fuddle Mr.At the office all the morning, though little to be done; because
all our clerks are gone to the buriall of Tom Whitton, one of the
Controller's clerks, a very ingenious, and a likely young man to live, as
any in the Office.But it is such a sickly time both in City and country
every where (of a sort of fever), that never was heard of almost, unless
it was in a plague-time.Among others, the famous Tom Fuller is dead of it; and Dr.Nichols, Dean
of Paul's; and my Lord General Monk is very dangerously ill.Dined at
home with the children and were merry, and my father with me; who after
dinner he and I went forth about business.John Williams at an alehouse, where we staid till past nine at
night, in Shoe Lane, talking about our country business, and I found him
so well acquainted with the matters of Gravely that I expect he will be of
great use to me.I understand my Aunt Fenner is upon
the point of death.At the Privy Seal, where we had a seal this morning.Then met with
Ned Pickering, and walked with him into St.James's Park (where I had not
been a great while), and there found great and very noble alterations.And, in our discourse, he was very forward to complain and to speak loud
of the lewdness and beggary of the Court, which I am sorry to hear, and
which I am afeard will bring all to ruin again.So he and I to the
Wardrobe to dinner, and after dinner Captain Ferrers and I to the Opera,
and saw "The Witts" again, which I like exceedingly.The Queen of Bohemia
was here, brought by my Lord Craven.So the Captain and I and another to
the Devil tavern and drank, and so by coach home.Troubled in mind that I
cannot bring myself to mind my business, but to be so much in love of
plays.We have been at a great loss a great while for a vessel that I
sent about a month ago with, things of my Lord's to Lynn, and cannot till
now hear of them, but now we are told that they are put into Soale Bay,
but to what purpose I know not.To our own church in the morning and so home to
dinner, where my father and Dr.Tom Pepys came to me to dine, and were
very merry.Sidney to my Lady to see
my Lord Hinchingbroke, who is now pretty well again, and sits up and walks
about his chamber.So I went to White Hall, and there hear that my Lord
General Monk continues very ill: so I went to la belle Pierce and sat with
her; and then to walk in St.James's Park, and saw great variety of fowl
which I never saw before and so home.At night fell to read in "Hooker's
Ecclesiastical Polity," which Mr.Moore did give me last Wednesday very
handsomely bound; and which I shall read with great pains and love for his
sake.At the office all the morning; at noon the children are sent for by
their mother my Lady Sandwich to dinner, and my wife goes along with them
by coach, and she to my father's and dines there, and from thence with
them to see Mrs.Cordery, who do invite them before my father goes into
the country, and thither I should have gone too but that I am sent for to
the Privy Seal, and there I found a thing of my Lord Chancellor's

     [This "thing" was probably one of those large grants which Clarendon
     quietly, or, as he himself says, "without noise or scandal,"
     procured from the king.Besides lands and manors, Clarendon states
     at one time that the king gave him a "little billet into his hand,
     that contained a warrant of his own hand-writing to Sir Stephen Fox
     to pay to the Chancellor the sum of L20,000,--[approximately 10
     million dollars in the year 2000]--of which nobody could have
     notice."In 1662 he received L5,000 out of the money voted to the
     king by the Parliament of Ireland, as he mentions in his vindication
     of himself against the impeachment of the Commons; and we shall see
     that Pepys, in February, 1664, names another sum of L20,000 given to
     the Chancellor to clear the mortgage upon Clarendon Park; and this
     last sum, it was believed, was paid from the money received from
     France by the sale of Dunkirk.--B.]to be sealed this afternoon, and so I am forced to go to Worcester House,
where severall Lords are met in Council this afternoon.And while I am
waiting there, in comes the King in a plain common riding-suit and velvet
cap, in which he seemed a very ordinary man to one that had not known him.Here I staid till at last, hearing that my Lord Privy Seal had not the
seal here, Mr.Moore and I hired a coach and went to Chelsy, and there at
an alehouse sat and drank and past the time till my Lord Privy Seal came
to his house, and so we to him and examined and sealed the thing, and so
homewards, but when we came to look for our coach we found it gone, so we
were fain to walk home afoot and saved our money.We met with a companion
that walked with us, and coming among some trees near the Neate houses, he
began to whistle, which did give us some suspicion, but it proved that he
that answered him was Mr.Marsh (the Lutenist) and his wife, and so we all
walked to Westminster together, in our way drinking a while at my cost,
and had a song of him, but his voice is quite lost.So walked home, and
there I found that my Lady do keep the children at home, and lets them not
come any more hither at present, which a little troubles me to lose their
company.At the office in the morning and all the afternoon at home to put
my papers in order.This day we come to some agreement with Sir R. Ford
for his house to be added to the office to enlarge our quarters.This morning by appointment I went to my father, and after a
morning draft he and I went to Dr.Williams, but he not within we went to
Mrs.Whately's, who lately offered a proposal of
her sister for a wife for my brother Tom, and with her we discoursed about
and agreed to go to her mother this afternoon to speak with her, and in
the meantime went to Will.Joyce's and to an alehouse, and drank a good
while together, he being very angry that his father Fenner will give him
and his brother no more for mourning than their father did give him and my
aunt at their mother's death, and a very troublesome fellow I still find
him to be, that his company ever wearys me.From thence about two o'clock
to Mrs.Whately's, but she being going to dinner we went to Whitehall and
there staid till past three, and here I understand by Mr.Moore that my
Lady Sandwich is brought to bed yesterday of a young Lady, and is very
well.Whately's again, and there were well received, and she
desirous to have the thing go forward, only is afeard that her daughter is
too young and portion not big enough, but offers L200 down with her.The
girl is very well favoured,, and a very child, but modest, and one I think
will do very well for my brother: so parted till she hears from Hatfield
from her husband, who is there; but I find them very desirous of it, and
so am I. Hence home to my father's, and I to the Wardrobe, where I supped
with the ladies, and hear their mother is well and the young child, and so
home.To the Privy Seal, and sealed; so home at noon, and there took my
wife by coach to my uncle Fenner's, where there was both at his house and
the Sessions, great deal of company, but poor entertainment, which I
wonder at; and the house so hot, that my uncle Wight, my father and I were
fain to go out, and stay at an alehouse awhile to cool ourselves.Then
back again and to church, my father's family being all in mourning, doing
him the greatest honour, the world believing that he did give us it: so to
church, and staid out the sermon, and then with my aunt Wight, my wife,
and Pall and I to her house by coach, and there staid and supped upon a
Westphalia ham, and so home and to bed.This morning I went to my father's, and there found him and my
mother in a discontent, which troubles me much, and indeed she is become
very simple and unquiet.Williams, and found him
within, and there we sat and talked a good while, and from him to Tom
Trice's to an alehouse near, and there sat and talked, and finding him
fair we examined my uncle's will before him and Dr.Williams, and had them
sign the copy and so did give T. Trice the original to prove, so he took
my father and me to one of the judges of the Court, and there we were
sworn, and so back again to the alehouse and drank and parted.Williams and I to a cook's where we eat a bit of mutton, and away, I to W.
Joyce's, where by appointment my wife was, and I took her to the Opera,
and shewed her "The Witts," which I had seen already twice, and was most
highly pleased with it.So with my wife to the Wardrobe to see my Lady,
and then home.At the office all the morning and did business; by and by we are
called to Sir W. Batten's to see the strange creature that Captain Holmes
hath brought with him from Guiny; it is a great baboon, but so much like a
man in most things, that though they say there is a species of them, yet I
cannot believe but that it is a monster got of a man and she-baboon.I do
believe that it already understands much English, and I am of the mind it
might be taught to speak or make signs.Hence the Comptroller and I to
Sir Rd.Ford's and viewed the house again, and are come to a complete end
with him to give him L200 per an.Isham
inquiring for me to take his leave of me, he being upon his voyage to
Portugal, and for my letters to my Lord which are not ready.But I took
him to the Mitre and gave him a glass of sack, and so adieu, and then
straight to the Opera, and there saw "Hamlet, Prince of Denmark," done
with scenes very well, but above all, Betterton

     [Sir William Davenant introduced the use of scenery.The character
     of Hamlet was one of Betterton's masterpieces.Downes tells us that
     he was taught by Davenant how the part was acted by Taylor of the
     Blackfriars, who was instructed by Shakespeare himself.]Hence homeward, and met with
Mr.Spong and took him to the Sampson in Paul's churchyard, and there
staid till late, and it rained hard, so we were fain to get home wet, and
so to bed.At church in the morning, and dined at home alone with
my wife very comfortably, and so again to church with her, and had a very
good and pungent sermon of Mr.Mills, discoursing the necessity of
restitution.Home, and I found my Lady Batten and her daughter to look
something askew upon my wife, because my wife do not buckle to them, and
is not solicitous for their acquaintance, which I am not troubled at at
all.By and by comes in my father (he intends to go into the country
to-morrow), and he and I among other discourse at last called Pall up to
us, and there in great anger told her before my father that I would keep
her no longer, and my father he said he would have nothing to do with her.At last, after we had brought down her high spirit, I got my father to
yield that she should go into the country with my mother and him, and stay
there awhile to see how she will demean herself.That being done, my
father and I to my uncle Wight's, and there supped, and he took his leave
of them, and so I walked with [him] as far as Paul's and there parted, and
I home, my mind at some rest upon this making an end with Pall, who do
trouble me exceedingly.This morning before I went out I made even with my maid Jane, who
has this day been my maid three years, and is this day to go into the
country to her mother.The poor girl cried, and I could hardly forbear
weeping to think of her going, for though she be grown lazy and spoilt by
Pall's coming, yet I shall never have one to please us better in all
things, and so harmless, while I live.So I paid her her wages and gave
her 2s.over, and bade her adieu, with my mind full of trouble at her
going.Hence to my father, where he and I and Thomas together setting
things even, and casting up my father's accounts, and upon the whole I
find that all he hath in money of his own due to him in the world is but
L45, and he owes about the same sum: so that I cannot but think in what a
condition he had left my mother if he should have died before my uncle
Robert.Hence to Tom Trice for the probate of the will and had it done to
my mind, which did give my father and me good content.From thence to my
Lady at the Wardrobe and thence to the Theatre, and saw the "Antipodes,"
wherein there is much mirth, but no great matter else.Bostock whom I met there (a clerk formerly of Mr.Phelps) to the Devil
tavern, and there drank and so away.I to my uncle Fenner's, where my
father was with him at an alehouse, and so we three went by ourselves and
sat talking a great while about a broker's daughter that he do propose for
a wife for Tom, with a great portion, but I fear it will not take, but he
will do what he can.So we broke up, and going through the street we met
with a mother and son, friends of my father's man, Ned's, who are angry at
my father's putting him away, which troubled me and my father, but all
will be well as to that.We have news this morning of my uncle Thomas and
his son Thomas being gone into the country without giving notice thereof
to anybody, which puts us to a stand, but I fear them not.At night at
home I found a letter from my Lord Sandwich, who is now very well again of
his feaver, but not yet gone from Alicante, where he lay sick, and was
twice let blood.This letter dated the 22nd July last, which puts me out
of doubt of his being ill.In my coming home I called in at the Crane
tavern at the Stocks by appointment, and there met and took leave of Mr.Fanshaw, who goes to-morrow and Captain Isham toward their voyage to
Portugal.Here we drank a great deal of wine, I too much and Mr.Fanshaw
till he could hardly go.This morning to the Wardrobe, and there took leave of my Lord
Hinchingbroke and his brother, and saw them go out by coach toward Rye in
their way to France, whom God bless.Then I was called up to my Lady's
bedside, where we talked an hour about Mr.Edward Montagu's disposing of
the L5000 for my Lord's departure for Portugal, and our fears that he will
not do it to my Lord's honour, and less to his profit, which I am to
enquire a little after.Hence to the office, and there sat till noon, and
then my wife and I by coach to my cozen, Thos.Pepys, the Executor, to
dinner, where some ladies and my father and mother, where very merry, but
methinks he makes but poor dinners for such guests, though there was a
poor venison pasty.Hence my wife and I to the Theatre, and there saw
"The Joviall Crew," where the King, Duke and Duchess, and Madame Palmer,
were; and my wife, to her great content, had a full sight of them all the
while.Hence to my father's, and there staid to
talk a while and so by foot home by moonshine.In my way and at home, my
wife making a sad story to me of her brother Balty's a condition, and
would have me to do something for him, which I shall endeavour to do, but
am afeard to meddle therein for fear I shall not be able to wipe my hands
of him again, when I once concern myself for him.I went to bed, my wife
all the while telling me his case with tears, which troubled me.At home all the morning setting papers in order.At noon to the
Exchange, and there met with Dr.Williams by appointment, and with him
went up and down to look for an attorney, a friend of his, to advise with
about our bond of my aunt Pepys of L200, and he tells me absolutely that
we shall not be forced to pay interest for the money yet.I spent the whole afternoon drinking with him and so home.This day I counterfeited a letter to Sir W. Pen, as from the thief that
stole his tankard lately, only to abuse and laugh at him.At the office all the morning, and at noon my father, mother, and
my aunt Bell (the first time that ever she was at my house) come to dine
with me, and were very merry.After dinner the two women went to visit my
aunt Wight, &c., and my father about other business, and I abroad to my
bookseller, and there staid till four o'clock, at which time by
appointment I went to meet my father at my uncle Fenner's.So thither I
went and with him to an alehouse, and there came Mr.Evans, the taylor,
whose daughter we have had a mind to get for a wife for Tom, and then my
father, and there we sat a good while and talked about the business; in
fine he told us that he hath not to except against us or our motion, but
that the estate that God hath blessed him with is too great to give where
there is nothing in present possession but a trade and house; and so we
friendly ended.There parted, my father and I together, and walked a
little way, and then at Holborn he and I took leave of one another, he
being to go to Brampton (to settle things against my mother comes)
tomorrow morning.At noon my wife and I met at the Wardrobe, and there dined with the
children, and after dinner up to my Lady's bedside, and talked and laughed
a good while.Then my wife end I to Drury Lane to the French comedy,
which was so ill done, and the scenes and company and every thing else so
nasty and out of order and poor, that I was sick all the while in my mind
to be there.Here my wife met with a son of my Lord Somersett, whom she
knew in France, a pretty man; I showed him no great countenance, to avoyd
further acquaintance.That done, there being nothing pleasant but the
foolery of the farce, we went home.At home and the office all the morning, and at noon comes Luellin
to me, and he and I to the tavern and after that to Bartholomew fair, and
there upon his motion to a pitiful alehouse, where we had a dirty slut or
two come up that were whores, but my very heart went against them, so that
I took no pleasure but a great deal of trouble in being there and getting
from thence for fear of being seen.From hence he and I walked towards
Ludgate and parted.I back again to the fair all alone, and there met
with my Ladies Jemimah and Paulina, with Mr.Pickering and Madamoiselle,
at seeing the monkeys dance, which was much to see, when they could be
brought to do so, but it troubled me to sit among such nasty company.After that with them into Christ's Hospitall, and there Mr.Pickering
bought them some fairings, and I did give every one of them a bauble,
which was the little globes of glass with things hanging in them, which
pleased the ladies very well.After that home with them in their coach,
and there was called up to my Lady, and she would have me stay to talk
with her, which I did I think a full hour.And the poor lady did with so
much innocency tell me how Mrs.Crispe had told her that she did intend,
by means of a lady that lies at her house, to get the King to be godfather
to the young lady that she is in childbed now of; but to see in what a
manner my Lady told it me, protesting that she sweat in the very telling
of it, was the greatest pleasure to me in the world to see the simplicity
and harmlessness of a lady.Then down to supper with the ladies, and so
home, Mr.Moore (as he and I cannot easily part) leading me as far as
Fenchurch Street to the Mitre, where we drank a glass of wine and so
parted, and I home and to bed.My maid Jane newly gone, and Pall left now to do all
the work till another maid comes, which shall not be till she goes away
into the country with my mother.My Lord
Sandwich in the Straits and newly recovered of a great sickness at
Alicante.My father gone to settle at Brampton, and myself under much
business and trouble for to settle things in the estate to our content.But what is worst, I find myself lately too much given to seeing of plays,
and expense, and pleasure, which makes me forget my business, which I must
labour to amend.No money comes in, so that I have been forced to borrow
a great deal for my own expenses, and to furnish my father, to leave
things in order.I have some trouble about my brother Tom, who is now
left to keep my father's trade, in which I have great fears that he will
miscarry for want of brains and care.At Court things are in very ill
condition, there being so much emulacion, poverty, and the vices of
drinking, swearing, and loose amours, that I know not what will be the end
of it, but confusion.And the Clergy so high, that all people that I meet
with do protest against their practice.In short, I see no content or
satisfaction any where, in any one sort of people.The Benevolence

     [A voluntary contribution made by the subjects to their sovereign.Upon this occasion the clergy alone gave L33,743: See May 31st,

proves so little, and an occasion of so much discontent every where; that
it had better it had never been set up.We are
at our Office quiet, only for lack of money all things go to rack.Our
very bills offered to be sold upon the Exchange at 10 per cent.We
are upon getting Sir R. Ford's house added to our Office.But I see so
many difficulties will follow in pleasing of one another in the dividing
of it, and in becoming bound personally to pay the rent of L200 per annum,
that I do believe it will yet scarce come to pass.The season very sickly
every where of strange and fatal fevers.ETEXT EDITOR'S BOOKMARKS:

   The Lotus flowers knew it,
   Our happiness together,
   While life was only River,
         Only love, and you and I.

   Love wakened on the River,
   To sounds of running water,
   With silver Stars for witness
         And reflected Stars for light;
   Awakened to existence,
   With ripples for first music
   And sunlight on the River
         For earliest sense of sight.Love grew upon the River
   Among the scented flowers,
   The open rosy flowers
         Of the Lotus buds in bloom--
   Love, brilliant as the Morning,
   More fervent than the Noon-day,
   And tender as the Twilight
         In its blue transparent gloom.Cold snow upon the mountains,
   The Lotus leaves turned yellow
         And the water very grey.Our kisses faint and falter,
   The clinging hands unfasten,
   The golden time is over
         And our passion dies away.To be forgotten,
           A ripple on the River,
           That flashes in the sunset,
           That flashed,--and died away.Second Song: The Girl from Baltistan

                            Throb, throb, throb,
   Far away in the blue transparent Night,
   On the outer horizon of a dreaming consciousness,
   She hears the sound of her lover's nearing boat
               Afar, afloat
   On the river's loneliness, where the Stars are the only light;
      Hear the sound of the straining wood
          Like a broken sob
          Of a heart's distress,
      Loving misunderstood.She lies, with her loose hair spent in soft disorder,
   On a silken sheet with a purple woven border,
   Every cell of her brain is latent fire,
   Every fibre tense with restrained desire.And the straining oars sound clearer, clearer,
          The boat is approaching nearer, nearer;
        "How to wait through the moments' space
        Till I see the light of my lover's face?"Throb, throb, throb,
   The sound dies down the stream
   Till it only clings at the senses' edge
   Like a half-remembered dream.Doubtless, he in the silence lies,
         His fair face turned to the tender skies,
         Starlight touching his sleeping eyes.While his boat caught in the thickset sedge
   And the waters round it gurgle and sob,
         Or floats set free on the river's tide,
                                  Oars laid aside.She is awake and knows no rest,
   Passion dies and is dispossessed
          Of his brief, despotic power.But the Brain, once kindled, would still be afire
   Were the whole world pasture to its desire,
   And all of love, in a single hour,--
   A single wine cup, filled to the brim,
                              Given to slake its thirst.Some there are who are thus-wise cursed
         Times that follow fulfilled desire
         Are of all their hours the worst.They find no Respite and reach no Rest,
   Though passion fail and desire grow dim,
         No assuagement comes from the thing possessed
                      For possession feeds the fire."Oh, for the life of the bright hued things
          Whose marriage and death are one,
        A floating fusion on golden wings."But we who re-marry a thousand times,
          As the spirit or senses will,
        In a thousand ways, in a thousand climes,
          We remain unsatisfied still."As her lover left her, alone, awake she lies,
   With a sleepless brain and weary, half-closed eyes.She turns her face where the purple silk is spread,
   Still sweet with delicate perfume his presence shed.Her arms remembered his vanished beauty still,
   And, reminiscent of clustered curls, her fingers thrill.While the wonderful, Starlit Night wears slowly on
   Till the light of another day, serene and wan,
                              Pierces the eastern skies.Palm Trees by the Sea

   Love, let me thank you for this!Now we have drifted apart,
   Wandered away from the sea,--
     For the fresh touch of your kiss,
   For the young warmth of your heart,
     For your youth given to me.Thanks: for the curls of your hair,
     Softer than silk to the hand,
   For the clear gaze of your eyes.For yourself: delicate, fair,
   Seen as you lay on the sand,
     Under the violet skies.Thanks: for the words that you said,--
     Secretly, tenderly sweet,
   All through the tropical day,
     Till, when the sunset was red,
   I, who lay still at your feet,
     Felt my life ebbing away,

   Weary and worn with desire,
     Only yourself could console.For that fierce fervour and fire
   Burnt through my lips to my soul
     From the white heat of your kiss!You were the essence of Spring,
     Wayward and bright as a flame:
   Though we have drifted apart,
     Still how the syllables sing
   Mixed in your musical name,
     Deep in the well of my heart!Once in the lingering light,
     Thrown from the west on the Sea,
   Laid you your garments aside,
     Slender and goldenly bright,
   Glimmered your beauty, set free,
     Bright as a pearl in the tide.Once, ere the thrill of the dawn
     Silvered the edge of the sea,
   I, who lay watching you rest,--
     Pale in the chill of the morn
   Found you still dreaming of me
     Stilled by love's fancies possessed.Fallen on sorrowful days,
     Love, let me thank you for this,
   You were so happy with me!Wrapped in Youth's roseate haze,
   Wanting no more than my kiss
     By the blue edge of the sea!Ah, for those nights on the sand
     Under the palms by the sea,
   For the strange dream of those days
     Spent in the passionate land,
   For your youth given to me,
     I am your debtor always!Song by Gulbaz

   "Is it safe to lie so lonely when the summer twilight closes
   No companion maidens, only you asleep among the roses?"Thirteen, fourteen years you number, and your hair is soft and scented,
   Perilous is such a slumber in the twilight all untented."Lonely loveliness means danger, lying in your rose-leaf nest,
   What if some young passing stranger broke into your careless rest?"But she would not heed the warning, lay alone serene and slight,
   Till the rosy spears of morning slew the darkness of the night.Young love, walking softly, found her, in the scented, shady closes,
   Threw his ardent arms around her, kissed her lips beneath the roses.And she said, with smiles and blushes, "Would that I had sooner known!Never now the morning thrushes wake and find me all alone."Since you said the rose-leaf cover sweet protection gave, but slight,
   I have found this dear young lover to protect me through the night!"Kashmiri Song

   Pale hands I love beside the Shalimar,
     Where are you now?Whom do you lead on Rapture's roadway, far,
     Before you agonise them in farewell?Oh, pale dispensers of my Joys and Pains,
     Holding the doors of Heaven and of Hell,
   How the hot blood rushed wildly through the veins
     Beneath your touch, until you waved farewell.Pale hands, pink tipped, like Lotus buds that float
     On those cool waters where we used to dwell,
   I would have rather felt you round my throat,
     Crushing out life, than waving me farewell!Reverie of Ormuz the Persian

   Softly the feathery Palm-trees fade in the violet Distance,
   Faintly the lingering light touches the edge of the sea,
   Sadly the Music of Waves, drifts, faint as an Anthem's insistence,
   Heard in the aisles of a dream, over the sandhills, to me.Now that the Lights are reversed, and the Singing changed into sighing,
   Now that the wings of our fierce, fugitive passion are furled,
   Take I unto myself, all alone in the light that is dying,
   Much of the sorrow that lies hid at the Heart of the World.Sad am I, sad for your loss: for failing the charm of your presence,
   Even the sunshine has paled, leaving the Zenith less blue.Even the ocean lessens the light of its green opalescence,
   Since, to my sorrow I loved, loved and grew weary of, you.Why was our passion so fleeting, why had the flush of your beauty
   Only so slender a spell, only so futile a power?Yet, even thus ever is life, save when long custom or duty
   Moulds into sober fruit Love's fragile and fugitive flower.Fain would my soul have been faithful; never an alien pleasure
   Lured me away from the light lit in your luminous eyes,
   But we have altered the World as pitiful man has leisure
   To criticise, balance, take counsel, assuredly lies.All through the centuries Man has gathered his flower, and fenced it,
   --Infinite strife to attain; infinite struggle to keep,--
   Holding his treasure awhile, all Fate and all forces against it,
   Knowing it his no more, if ever his vigilance sleep.But we have altered the World as pitiful man has grown stronger,
   So that the things we love are as easily kept as won,
   Therefore the ancient fight can engage and detain us no longer,
   And all too swiftly, alas, passion is over and done.Far too speedily now we can gather the coveted treasure,
   Enjoy it awhile, be satiated, begin to tire;
   And what shall be done henceforth with the profitless after-leisure,
   Who has the breath to kindle the ash of a faded fire?After my ardent endeavour
   Came the delirious Joy, flooding my life like a sea,
   Days of delight that are burnt on the brain for ever and ever,
   Days and nights when you loved, before you grew weary of me.Softly the sunset decreases dim in the violet Distance,
   Even as Love's own fervour has faded away from me,
   Leaving the weariness, the monotonous Weight of Existence,--
   All the farewells in the world weep in the sound of the sea.Sunstroke

   Oh, straight, white road that runs to meet,
            Across green fields, the blue green sea,
   You knew the little weary feet
            Of my child bride that was to be!Her people brought her from the shore
            One golden day in sultry June,
   And I stood, waiting, at the door,
            Praying my eyes might see her soon.With eager arms, wide open thrown,
            Now never to be satisfied!Ere I could make my love my own
            She closed her amber eyes and died.they took no heed
            How frail she was, my little one,
   But brought her here with cruel speed
            Beneath the fierce, relentless sun.We laid her on the marriage bed
            The bridal flowers in her hand,
   A maiden from the ocean led
            Only, alas!I walk alone; the air is sweet,
            The white road wanders to the sea,
   I dream of those two little feet
            That grew so tired in reaching me.Adoration

   Who does not feel desire unending
     To solace through his daily strife,
   With some mysterious Mental Blending,
     The hungry loneliness of life?Until, by sudden passion shaken,
     As terriers shake a rat at play,
   He finds, all blindly, he has taken
     The old, Hereditary way.Yet, in the moment of communion,
     The very heart of passion's fire,
   His spirit spurns the mortal union,
     "Not this, not this, the Soul's desire!"*        *        *        *

   Oh You, by whom my life is riven,
     And reft away from my control,
   Take back the hours of passion given!Although I once, in ardent fashion,
     Implored you long to give me this;
   (In hopes to stem, or stifle, passion)
     Your hair to touch, your lips to kiss

   Now that your gracious self has granted
     The loveliness you hold as naught,
   I find, alas!not that I wanted--
     Possession has not stifled Thought.Desire its aim has only shifted,--
     Built hopes upon another plan,
   And I in love for you have drifted
     Beyond all passion known to man.Beyond all dreams of soft caresses
     The solacing of any kiss,--
   Beyond the fragrance of your tresses
     (Once I had sold my soul for this!)But now I crave no mortal union
     (Thanks for that sweetness in the past);
   I need some subtle, strange communion,
     Some sense that _I_ join _you_, at last.Long past the pulse and pain of passion,
     Long left the limits of all love,--
   I crave some nearer, fuller fashion,
     Some unknown way, beyond, above,--

   Some infinitely inner fusion,
     As Wave with Water; Flame with Fire,--
   Let me dream once the dear delusion
     That I am You, Oh, Heart's Desire!Your kindness lent to my caresses
     That beauty you so lightly prize,--
   The midnight of your sable tresses,
     The twilight of your shadowed eyes.Ah, for that gift all thanks are given!Yet, Oh, adored, beyond control,
   Count all the passionate past forgiven
     And love me once, once, from your soul.Three Songs of Zahir-u-Din

   The tropic day's redundant charms
     Cool twilight soothes away,
   The sun slips down behind the palms
     And leaves the landscape grey.I want to take you in my arms
           And kiss your lips away!I wake with sunshine in my eyes
     And find the morning blue,
   A night of dreams behind me lies
     And all were dreams of you!Ah, how I wish the while I rise,
           That what I dream were true.The weary day's laborious pace,
     I hasten and beguile
   By fancies, which I backwards trace
     To things I loved erstwhile;
           The weary sweetness of your face,
           Your faint, illusive smile.The silken softness of your hair
     Where faint bronze shadows are,
   Your strangely slight and youthful air,
     No passions seem to mar,--
           Oh, why, since Fate has made you fair,
           Must Fortune keep you far?Thus spent, the day so long and bright
     Less hot and brilliant seems,
   Till in a final flare of light
     The sun withdraws his beams.Then, in the coolness of the night,
           I meet you in my dreams!Second Song

   How much I loved that way you had
   Of smiling most, when very sad,
   A smile which carried tender hints
       Of delicate tints
       And warbling birds,
       Of sun and spring,
   And yet, more than all other thing,
   Of Weariness beyond all Words!None other ever smiled that way,
       None that I know,--
   The essence of all Gaiety lay,
   Of all mad mirth that men may know,
   In that sad smile, serene and slow,
   That on your lips was wont to play.It needed many delicate lines
   And subtle curves and roseate tints
   To make that weary radiant smile;
   It flickered, as beneath the vines
   The sunshine through green shadow glints
   On the pale path that lies below,
   Flickered and flashed, and died away,
   But the strange thoughts it woke meanwhile
       Were wont to stay.Thoughts of Strange Things you used to know
   In dim, dead lives, lived long ago,
   Some madly mirthful Merriment
   Whose lingering light is yet unspent,--
   Some unimaginable Woe,--
   Your strange, sad smile forgets these not,
   Though you, yourself, long since, forgot!Third Song, written during Fever

   To-night the clouds hang very low,
       They take the Hill-tops to their breast,
       And lay their arms about the fields.The wind that fans me lying low,
       Restless with great desire for rest,
       No cooling touch of freshness yields.I, sleepless through the stifling heat,
       Watch the pale Lightning's constant glow
       Between the wide set open doors.I lie and long amidst the heat,--
       The fever that my senses know,
       For that cool slenderness of yours.A roseleaf that has lain in snow,
       A snowflake tinged with sunset fire.You do not know, so young you are,
       How Fever fans the senses' glow
       To uncontrollable desire!And fills the spaces of the night
       With furious and frantic thought,
       One would not dare to think by day.Ah, if you came to me to-night
       These visions would be turned to naught,
       These hateful dreams be held at bay!But you are far, and Loneliness
       My only lover through the night;
       And not for any word or prayer
   Would you console my loneliness
       Or lend yourself, serene and slight,
       And the cool clusters of your hair.All through the night I long for you,
       As shipwrecked men in tropics yearn
       For the fresh flow of streams and springs.My fevered fancies follow you
       As dying men in deserts turn
       Their thoughts to clear and chilly things.Such dreams are mine, and such my thirst,
       Unceasing and unsatisfied,
       Until the night is burnt away
   Among these dreams and fevered thirst,
       And, through the open doorways, glide
       The white feet of the coming day.The Regret of the Ranee in the Hall of Peacocks

   This man has taken my Husband's life
     And laid my Brethren low,
   No sister indeed, were I, no wife,
     To pardon and let him go.Yet why does he look so young and slim
     As he weak and wounded lies?How hard for me to be harsh to him
     With his soft, appealing eyes.His hair is ruffled upon the stone
     And the slender wrists are bound,
   So young!and yet he has overthrown
     His scores on the battle ground.Would I were only a slave to-day,
     To whom it were right and meet
   To wash the stains of the War away,
     The dust from the weary feet.Were I but one of my serving girls
     To solace his pain to rest!Shake out the sand from the soft loose curls,
     And hold him against my breast!Would God that I were the senseless stone
     To support his slender length!I hate those wounds that trouble my sight,
     Unknown!how I wish you lay,
   Alone in my silken tent to-night
     While I charmed the pain away.I would lay you down on the Royal bed,
     I would bathe your wounds with wine,
   And setting your feet against my head
     Dream you were lover of mine.My Crown is heavy upon my hair,
     The Jewels weigh on my breast,
   All I would leave, with delight, to share
     Your pale and passionate rest!But hands grow restless about their swords,
     Lips murmur below their breath,
   "The Queen is silent too long!""My Lords,
     --Take him away to death!"Protest: By Zahir-u-Din

   Alas!this wasted Night
   With all its Jasmin-scented air,
   Its thousand stars, serenely bright!I lie alone, and long for you,
   Long for your Champa-scented hair,
   Your tranquil eyes of twilight hue;

   Long for the close-curved, delicate lips
   --Their sinuous sweetness laid on mine--
   Here, where the slender fountain drips,
   Here, where the yellow roses glow,
   Pale in the tender silver shine
   The stars across the garden throw.The poets hardly speak the truth,--
   Despite their praiseful litany,
   His season is not all delights
   Nor every night an ecstasy!The very power and passion that make--
   _Might_ make--his days one golden dream,
   How he must suffer for their sake!Till, in their fierce and futile rage,
   The baffled senses almost deem
   They might be happier in old age.Age that can find red roses sweet,
   And yet not crave a rose-red mouth;
   Hear Bulbuls, with no wish that feet
   Of sweeter singers went his way;
   Inhale warm breezes from the South,
   Yet never fed his fancy stray.From some near Village I can hear
   The cadenced throbbing of a drum,
   Now softly distant, now more near;
   And in an almost human fashion,
   It, plaintive, wistful, seems to come
   Laden with sighs of fitful passion,

   To mock me, lying here alone
   Among the thousand useless flowers
   Upon the fountain's border-stone--
   Cold stone, that chills me as I lie
   Counting the slowly passing hours
   By the white spangles in the sky.Some feast the Tom-toms celebrate,
   Where, close together, side by side,
   Gay in their gauze and tinsel state
   With lips serene and downcast eyes,
   Sit the young bridegroom and his bride,
   While round them songs and laughter rise.They are together; Why are we
   So hopelessly, so far apart?Oh, I implore you, come to me!Come to me, Solace of mine eyes!A little, languid, mocking breeze
   That rustles through the Jasmin flowers
   And stirs among the Tamarind trees;
   A little gurgle of the spray
   That drips, unheard, though silent hours,
   Then breaks in sudden bubbling play.Why, therefore, mock at my repose?Is it my fault I am alone
   Beneath the feathery Tamarind tree
   Whose shadows over me are thrown?Nay, I am mad indeed, with thirst
   For all to me this night denied
   And drunk with longing, and accurst
   Beyond all chance of sleep or rest,
   With love, unslaked, unsatisfied,
   And dreams of beauty unpossessed.Hating the hour that brings you not,
   Mad at the space betwixt us twain,
   Sad for my empty arms, so hot
   And fevered, even the chilly stone
   Can scarcely cool their burning pain,--
   And oh, this sense of being alone!Take hence, O Night, your wasted hours,
   You bring me not my Life's Delight,
   My Star of Stars, my Flower of Flowers!You leave me loveless and forlorn,
   Pass on, most false and futile night,
   Pass on, and perish in the Dawn!Famine Song

   Death and Famine on every side
       And never a sign of rain,
   The bones of those who have starved and died
       Unburied upon the plain.What care have I that the bones bleach white?To-morrow they may be mine,
   But I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And drink your lips like wine!Cholera, Riot, and Sudden Death,
       And the brave red blood set free,
   The glazing eye and the failing breath,--
       But what are these things to me?Your breath is quick and your eyes are bright
       And your blood is red like wine,
   And I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And hold your lips with mine!I hear the sound of a thousand tears,
       Like softly pattering rain,
   I see the fever, folly, and fears
       Fulfilling man's tale of pain.But for the moment your star is bright,
       I revel beneath its shine,
   For I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And feel your lips on mine!And you need not deem me over cold,
       That I do not stop to think
   For all the pleasure this Life may hold
       Is on the Precipice brink.Thought could but lessen my soul's delight,
       And to-day she may not pine.For I shall lie in your arms to-night
       And close your lips with mine!I trust what sorrow the Fates may send
       I may carry quietly through,
   And pray for grace when I reach the end,
       To die as a man should do.To-day, at least, must be clear and bright,
       Without a sorrowful sign,
   Because I sleep in your arms to-night
       And feel your lips on mine!So on I work, in the blazing sun,
       To bury what dead we may,
   But glad, oh, glad, when the day is done
       And the night falls round us grey.Would those we covered away from sight
       Had a rest as sweet as mine!For I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And drink your lips like wine!The Window Overlooking the Harbour

   Sad is the Evening: all the level sand
     Lies left and lonely, while the restless sea,
   Tired of the green caresses of the land,
     Withdraws into its own infinity.But still more sad this white and chilly Dawn
     Filling the vacant spaces of the sky,
   While little winds blow here and there forlorn
     And all the stars, weary of shining, die.And more than desolate, to wake, to rise,
     Leaving the couch, where softly sleeping still,
   What through the past night made my heaven, lies;
     And looking out across the window sill

   See, from the upper window's vantage ground,
     Mankind slip into harness once again,
   And wearily resume his daily round
     Of love and labour, toil and strife and pain.How the sad thoughts slip back across the night:
     The whole thing seems so aimless and so vain.What use the raptures, passion and delight,
     Burnt out; as though they could not wake again.The worn-out nerves and weary brain repeat
     The question: Whither all these passions tend;--
   This curious thirst, so painful and so sweet,
     So fierce, so very short-lived, to what end?Even, if seeking for ourselves, the Race,
     The only immortality we know,--
   Even if from the flower of our embrace
     Some spark should kindle, or some fruit should grow,

   What were the use?the gain, to us or it,
     That we should cause another You or Me,--
   Another life, from our light passion lit,
     To suffer like ourselves awhile and die.Our being runs
     In a closed circle.All we know or see
   Tends to assure us that a thousand Suns,
     Teeming perchance with life, have ceased to be.Ah, the grey Dawn seems more than desolate,
     And the past night of passion worse than waste,
   Love but a useless flower, that soon or late,
     Turns to a fruit with bitter aftertaste.Youth, even Youth, seems futile and forlorn
     While the new day grows slowly white above.Pale and reproachful comes the chilly Dawn
     After the fervour of a night of love.Back to the Border

   The tremulous morning is breaking
     Against the white waste of the sky,
   And hundreds of birds are awaking
     In tamarisk bushes hard by.I, waiting alone in the station,
     Can hear in the distance, grey-blue,
   The sound of that iron desolation,
     The train that will bear me from you.'T will carry me under your casement,
     You'll feel in your dreams as you lie
   The quiver, from gable to basement,
     The rush of my train sweeping by.And I shall look out as I pass it,--
     Your dear, unforgettable door,
   'T was _ours_ till last night, but alas!it
     Will never be mine any more.Through twilight blue-grey and uncertain,
     Where frost leaves the window-pane free,
   I'll look at the tinsel-edged curtain
     That hid so much pleasure for me.I go to my long undone duty
     Alone in the chill and the gloom,
   My eyes are still full of the beauty
     I leave in your rose-scented room.Lie still in your dreams; for your tresses
     Are free of my lingering kiss.I keep you awake with caresses
     No longer; be happy in this!From passion you told me you hated
     You're now and for ever set free,
   I pass in my train, sorrow-weighted,
     Your house that was Heaven to me.You won't find a trace, when you waken,
     Of me or my love of the past,
   Rise up and rejoice!I have taken
     My longed-for departure at last.My fervent and useless persistence
     You never need suffer again,
   Nor even perceive in the distance
     The smoke of my vanishing train!Reverie: Zahir-u-Din

   Alone, I wait, till her twilight gate
                        The Night slips quietly through,
   With shadow and gloom, and purple bloom,
                        Flung over the Zenith blue.Her stars that tremble, would fain dissemble
                        Light over lovers thrown,--
   Her hush and mystery know no history
                        Such as day may own.Day has record of pleasure and pain,
   But things that are done by Night remain
                        For ever and ever unknown.For a thousand years, 'neath a thousand skies,
                        Night has brought men love;
   Therefore the old, old longings rise
                        As the light grows dim above.Therefore, now that the shadows close,
                        And the mists weird and white,
   While Time is scented with musk and rose;
                        Magic with silver light.I long for love; will you grant me some?as lovers have always come,
                        Through the evenings of the Past.Swiftly, as lovers have always come,
   Softly, as lovers have always come
                        Through the long-forgotten Past.Sea Song

   Against the planks of the cabin side,
       (So slight a thing between them and me,)
   The great waves thundered and throbbed and sighed,
       The great green waves of the Indian sea!Your face was white as the foam is white,
       Your hair was curled as the waves are curled,
   I would we had steamed and reached that night
       The sea's last edge, the end of the world.The wind blew in through the open port,
       So freshly joyous and salt and free,
   Your hair it lifted, your lips it sought,
       And then swept back to the open sea.The engines throbbed with their constant beat;
       Your heart was nearer, and all I heard;
   Your lips were salt, but I found them sweet,
       While, acquiescent, you spoke no word.So straight you lay in your narrow berth,
       Rocked by the waves; and you seemed to be
   Essence of all that is sweet on earth,
       Of all that is sad and strange at sea.And you were white as the foam is white,
       Your hair was curled as the waves are curled.had we but sailed and reached that night,
       The sea's last edge, the end of the world!'T is eight miles out and eight miles in,
        Just at the break of morn.'T is ice without and flame within,
        To gain a kiss at dawn!Far, where the Lilac Hills arise
        Soft from the misty plain,
   A lone enchanted hollow lies
        Where I at last drew rein.Midwinter grips this lonely land,
        This stony, treeless waste,
   Where East, due East, across the sand,
        We fly in fevered haste.the East will soon be red,
        The wild duck westward fly,
   And make above my anxious head,
        Triangles in the sky.Like wind we go; we both are still
        So young; all thanks to Fate!(It cuts like knives, this air so chill,)
        Dear God!Behind us, wrapped in mist and sleep
        The Ruined City lies,
   (Although we race, we seem to creep!)Eight miles out only, eight miles in,
        Good going all the way;
   But more and more the clouds begin
        To redden into day.And every snow-tipped peak grows pink
        An iridescent gem!My heart beats quick, with joy, to think
        How I am nearing them!As mile on mile behind us falls,
        Till, Oh, delight!I see
   My Heart's Desire, who softly calls
        Across the gloom to me.The utter joy of that First Love
        No later love has given,
   When, while the skies grew light above,
        We entered into Heaven.Till I Wake

   When I am dying, lean over me tenderly, softly,
     Stoop, as the yellow roses droop in the wind from the South.So I may, when I wake, if there be an Awakening,
     Keep, what lulled me to sleep, the touch of your lips on my mouth.His Rubies: Told by Valgovind

   Along the hot and endless road,
     Calm and erect, with haggard eyes,
   The prisoner bore his fetters' load
     Beneath the scorching, azure skies.Serene and tall, with brows unbent,
     Without a hope, without a friend,
   He, under escort, onward went,
     With death to meet him at the end.The Poppy fields were pink and gay
     On either side, and in the heat
   Their drowsy scent exhaled all day
     A dream-like fragrance almost sweet.And when the cool of evening fell
     And tender colours touched the sky,
   He still felt youth within him dwell
     And half forgot he had to die.Sometimes at night, the Camp-fires lit
     And casting fitful light around,
   His guard would, friend-like, let him sit
     And talk awhile with them, unbound.Thus they, the night before the last,
     Were resting, when a group of girls
   Across the small encampment passed,
     With laughing lips and scented curls.Then in the Prisoner's weary eyes
     A sudden light lit up once more,
   The women saw him with surprise,
     And pity for the chains he bore.For little women reck of Crime
     If young and fair the criminal be
   Here in this tropic, amorous clime
     Where love is still untamed and free.John went to the office.And one there was, she walked less fast,
     Behind the rest, perhaps beguiled
   By his lithe form, who, as she passed,
     Waited a little while, and smiled.The guard, in kindly Eastern fashion,
     Smiled to themselves, and let her stay.So tolerant of human passion,
     "To love he has but one more day."Yet when (the soft and scented gloom
     Scarce lighted by the dying fire)
   His arms caressed her youth and bloom,
     With him it was not all desire."For me," he whispered, as he lay,
     "But little life remains to live.One thing I crave to take away:
     You have the gift; but will you give?"If I could know some child of mine
     Would live his life, and see the sun
   Across these fields of poppies shine,
     What should I care that mine is done?"To die would not be dying quite,
     Leaving a little life behind,
   You, were you kind to me to-night,
     Could grant me this; but--are you kind?"See, I have something here for you
     For you and It, if It there be."Soft in the gloom her glances grew,
     With gentle tears he could not see.He took the chain from off his neck,
     Hid in the silver chain there lay
   Three rubies, without flaw or fleck.He drew her close; the moonless skies
     Shed little light; the fire was dead.Soft pity filled her youthful eyes,
     And many tender things she said.Throughout the hot and silent night
     All that he asked of her she gave.And, left alone ere morning light,
     He went serenely to the grave,

   Happy; for even when the rope
     Confined his neck, his thoughts were free,
   And centered round his Secret Hope
     The little life that was to be.When Poppies bloomed again, she bore
     His child who gaily laughed and crowed,
   While round his tiny neck he wore
     The rubies given on the road.For his small sake she wished to wait,
     But vainly to forget she tried,
   And grieving for the Prisoner's fate,
     She broke her gentle heart and died.Song of Taj Mahomed

   Dear is my inlaid sword; across the Border
   It brought me much reward; dear is my Mistress,
   The jewelled treasure of an amorous hour.Dear beyond measure are my dreams and Fancies.These I adore; for these I live and labour,
   Holding them more than sword or jewelled Mistress,
   For this indeed may rust, and that prove faithless,
   But, till my limbs are dust, I have my Fancies.The Garden of Kama:

   Kama the Indian Eros

   The daylight is dying,
   The Flying fox flying,
         Amber and amethyst burn in the sky.See, the sun throws a late,
   Lingering, roseate
         Kiss to the landscape to bid it good-bye.Oh, come, unresisting,
         Lovely, expectant, on tentative feet.Shadow shall cover us,
   Roses bend over us,
         Making a bride chamber, sacred and sweet.We know not life's reason,
   The length of its season,
         Know not if they know, the great Ones above.We none of us sought it,
   And few could support it,
         Were it not gilt with the glamour of love.But much is forgiven
   To Gods who have given,
         If but for an hour, the Rapture of Youth.You do not yet know it,
   But Kama shall show it,
         Changing your dreams to his Exquisite Truth.The Fireflies shall light you,
   And naught shall afright you,
         Nothing shall trouble the Flight of the Hours.Come, for I wait for you,
   Night is too late for you,
         Come, while the twilight is closing the flowers.Every breeze still is,
   And, scented with lilies,
         Cooled by the twilight, refreshed by the dew,
   The garden lies breathless,
   Where Kama, the Deathless,
         In the hushed starlight, is waiting for you.Camp Follower's Song, Gomal River

   We have left Gul Kach behind us,
      Are marching on Apozai,--
   Where pleasure and rest are waiting
      To welcome us by and by.We're falling back from the Gomal,
      Across the Gir-dao plain,
   The camping ground is deserted,
      We'll never come back again.Along the rocks and the defiles,
      The mules and the camels wind.Good-bye to Rahimut-Ullah,
      The man who is left behind.For some we lost in the skirmish,
      And some were killed in the fight,
   But he was captured by fever,
      In the sentry pit, at night.A rifle shot had been swifter,
      Less trouble a sabre thrust,
   But his Fate decided fever,
      And each man dies as he must.The wavering flames rise high,
   The flames of our burning grass-huts,
      Against the black of the sky.We hear the sound of the river,
      An ever-lessening moan,
   The hearts of us all turn backwards
      To where he is left alone.We sing up a little louder,
      We know that we feel bereft,
   We're leaving the camp together,
      And only one of us left.The only one, out of many,
      And each must come to his end,
   I wish I could stop this singing,
      He happened to be my friend.We're falling back from the Gomal
      We're marching on Apozai,
   And pleasure and rest are waiting
      To welcome us by and by.Perhaps the feast will taste bitter,
      The lips of the girls less kind,--
   Because of Rahimut-Ullah,
      The man who is left behind!Song of the Colours: by Taj Mahomed

   _Rose-colour_
   Rose Pink am I, the colour gleams and glows
     In many a flower; her lips, those tender doors
   By which, in time of love, love's essence flows
     From him to her, are dyed in delicate Rose.Mine is the earliest Ruby light that pours
     Out of the East, when day's white gates unclose.On downy peach, and maiden's downier cheek
     I, in a flush of radiant bloom, alight,
   Clinging, at sunset, to the shimmering peak
     I veil its snow in floods of Roseate light._Azure_
   Mine is the heavenly hue of Azure skies,
     Where the white clouds lie soft as seraphs' wings,
   Mine the sweet, shadowed light in innocent eyes,
     Whose lovely looks light only on lovely things.Mine the Blue Distance, delicate and clear,
     Mine the Blue Glory of the morning sea,
   All that the soul so longs for, finds not here,
     Fond eyes deceive themselves, and find in me.to the Royal Red of living Blood,
     Let loose by steel in spirit-freeing flood,
   Forced from faint forms, by toil or torture torn
     Staining the patient gates of life new born.Colour of War and Rage, of Pomp and Show,
     Banners that flash, red flags that flaunt and glow,
   Colour of Carnage, Glory, also Shame,
     Raiment of women women may not name.I hide in mines, where unborn Rubies dwell,
     Flicker and flare in fitful fire in Hell,
   The outpressed life-blood of the grape is mine,
     Hail!Strong am I, over strong, to eyes that tire,
     In the hot hue of Rapine, Riot, Flame.Death and Despair are black, War and Desire,
     The two red cards in Life's unequal game._Green_
   I am the Life of Forests, and Wandering Streams,
     Green as the feathery reeds the Florican love,
   Young as a maiden, who of her marriage dreams,
     Still sweetly inexperienced in ways of Love.Colour of Youth and Hope, some waves are mine,
     Some emerald reaches of the evening sky.See, in the Spring, my sweet green Promise shine,
     Never to be fulfilled, of by and by.Never to be fulfilled; leaves bud, and ever
     Something is wanting, something falls behind;
   The flowered Solstice comes indeed, but never
     That light and lovely summer men divined._Violet_
   I were the colour of Things, (if hue they had)
         That are hard to name.Of curious, twisted thoughts that men call "mad"
         Or oftener "shame."Of that delicate vice, that is hardly vice,
         So reticent, rare,
   Ethereal, as the scent of buds and spice,
         In this Eastern air.On palm-fringed shores I colour the Cowrie shell,
         With its edges curled;
   And, deep in Datura poison buds, I dwell
         In a perfumed world.My lilac tinges the edge of the evening sky
         Where the sunset clings.My purple lends an Imperial Majesty
         To the robes of kings._Yellow_
   Gold am I, and for me, ever men curse and pray,
     Selling their souls and each other, by night and day.A sordid colour, and yet, I make some things fair,
     Dying sunsets, fields of corn, and a maiden's hair.Thus they discoursed in the daytime,--Violet, Yellow, and Blue,
     Emerald, Scarlet, and Rose-colour, the pink and perfect hue.Thus they spoke in the sunshine, when their beauty was manifest,
     Till the Night came, and the Silence, and gave them an equal rest.Lalila, to the Ferengi Lover

   Why above others was I so blessed
      And honoured?to be chosen one
   To hold you, sleeping, against my breast,
      As now I may hold your only son.You gave your life to me in a kiss;
   Have I done well, for that past delight,
      In return, to have given you this?Look down at his face, your face, beloved,
      His eyes are azure as yours are blue.In every line of his form is proved
      How well I loved you, and only you.I felt the secret hope at my heart
      Turned suddenly to the living joy,
   And knew that your life and mine had part
      As golden grains in a brass alloy.And learning thus, that your child was mine,
      Thrilled by the sense of its stirring life,
   I held myself as a sacred shrine
      Afar from pleasure, and pain, and strife,

   That all unworthy I might not be
      Of that you had deigned to cause to dwell
   Hidden away in the heart of me,
      As white pearls hide in a dusky shell.Do you remember, when first you laid
      Your lips on mine, that enchanted night?My eyes were timid, my lips afraid,
      You seemed so slender and strangely white.I always tremble; the moments flew
      Swiftly to dawn that took you away,
   But this is a small and lovely you
      Content to rest in my arms all day.Oh, since you have sought me, Lord, for this,
      And given your only child to me,
   My life devoted to yours and his,
      Whilst I am living, will always be.And after death, through the long To Be,
      (Which, I think, must surely keep love's laws,)
   I, should you chance to have need of me,
      Am ever and always, only yours.On the City Wall

   Upon the City Ramparts, lit up by sunset gleam,
   The Blue eyes that conquer, meet the Darker eyes that dream.The Dark eyes, so Eastern, and the Blue eyes from the West,
   The last alight with action, the first so full of rest.Brown, that seem to hold the Past; its magic mystery,
   Blue, that catch the early light, of ages yet to be.Meet and fall and meet again, then linger, look, and smile,
   Time and distance all forgotten, for a little while.Happy on the city wall, in the warm spring weather,
   All the force of Nature's laws, drawing them together.East and West so gaily blending, for a little space,
   All the sunshine seems to centre, round th' Enchanted place!One rides down the dusty road, one watches from the wall,
   Azure eyes would fain return, and Amber eyes recall;

   Would fain be on the ramparts, and resting heart to heart,
   But time o' love is overpast, East and West must part.Those are dim, and ride away, these cry themselves to sleep._"Oh, since Love is all so short, the sob so near the smile,_
   _Blue eyes that always conquer us, is it worth your while?"_





"Love Lightly"

   There were Roses in the hedges, and Sunshine in the sky,
   Red Lilies in the sedges, where the water rippled by,
   A thousand Bulbuls singing, oh, how jubilant they were,
   And a thousand flowers flinging their sweetness on the air.But you, who sat beside me, had a shadow in your eyes,
   Their sadness seemed to chide me, when I gave you scant replies;
   You asked "Did I remember?"In vain you fanned the ember, for the love flame was not there."And so, since you are tired of me, you ask me to forget,
     What is the use of caring, now that you no longer care?When Love is dead his Memory can only bring regret,
     But how can I forget you with the flowers in your hair?"What use the scented Roses, or the azure of the sky?They are sweet when Love reposes, but then he had to die.What could I do in leaving you, but ask you to forget,--
   I suffered, too, in grieving you; I all but loved you yet.But half love is a treason, that no lover can forgive,
   I had loved you for a season, I had no more to give.You saw my passion faltered, for I could but let you see,
   And it was not I that altered, but Fate that altered me.And so, since I am tired of love, I ask you to forget,
     What is the use you caring, now that I no longer care?When Love is dead, his Memory can only bring regret;
     Forget me, oh, forget me, and my flower-scented hair!No Rival Like the Past

   As those who eat a Luscious Fruit, sunbaked,
     Full of sweet juice, with zest, until they find
   It finished, and their appetite unslaked,
     And so return and eat the pared-off rind;--

   We, who in Youth, set white and careless teeth
     In the Ripe Fruits of Pleasure while they last,
   Later, creep back to gnaw the cast-off sheath,
     And find there is no Rival like the Past.Verse by Taj Mahomed

   When first I loved, I gave my very soul
   Utterly unreserved to Love's control,
   But Love deceived me, wrenched my youth away
   And made the gold of life for ever grey.Long I lived lonely, yet I tried in vain
   With any other Joy to stifle pain;
   There _is_ no other joy, I learned to know,
   And so returned to Love, as long ago.Yet I, this little while ere I go hence,
   Love very lightly now, in self-defence.Lines by Taj Mahomed

   This passion is but an ember
     Of a Sun, of a Fire, long set;
   I could not live and remember,
     And so I love and forget.You say, and the tone is fretful,
     That my mourning days were few,
   You call me over forgetful--
     My God, if you only knew!There is no Breeze to Cool the Heat of Love

   The listless Palm-trees catch the breeze above
     The pile-built huts that edge the salt Lagoon,
   There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love,
     No wind from land or sea, at night or noon.Perfumed and robed I wait, my Lord, for you,
     And my heart waits alert, with strained delight,
   My flowers are loath to close, as though they knew
     That you will come to me before the night.In the Verandah all the lights are lit,
     And softly veiled in rose to please your eyes,
   Between the pillars flying foxes flit,
     Their wings transparent on the lilac skies.Come soon, my Lord, come soon, I almost fear
     My heart may fail me in this keen suspense,
   Break with delight, at last, to know you near.Pleasure is one with Pain, if too intense.I envy these: the steps that you will tread,
     The jasmin that will touch you by its leaves,
   When, in your slender height, you stoop your head
     At the low door beneath the palm-thatched eaves.For though you utterly belong to me,
     And love has done his utmost 'twixt us twain,
   Your slightest, careless touch yet seems to be
     That keen delight so much akin to pain.The night breeze blows across the still Lagoon,
     And stirs the Palm-trees till they wave above
   Our pile-built huts; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon,
     There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love.Every time you give yourself to me,
     The gift seems greater, and yourself more fair,
   This slight-built, palm-thatched hut has come to be
     A temple, since, my Lord, you visit there.And as the water, gurgling softly, goes
     Among the piles beneath the slender floor;
   I hear it murmur, as it seaward flows,
     Of the great Wonder seen upon the shore.The Miracle, that you should come to me,
     Whom the whole world, seeing, can but desire,
   It is as though some White Star stooped to be
     The messmate of our little cooking fire.Leaving the Glory of his Purple Skies,
     And the White Friendship of the Crescent Moon,
   And yet;--I look into your brilliant eyes,
     And find content; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon.Perfumed and robed I wait for you, I wait,
     The flowers that please you wreathed about my hair,
   And this poor face set forth in jewelled state,
     So more than proud since you have found it fair.My lute is ready, and the fragrant drink
     Your lips may honour, how it will rejoice
   Losing its life in yours!the lute I think
     But wastes the time when I might hear your voice.Your slightest, as your utmost, wish or will,
   Whether it please you to caress or slay,
     It would please me to give obedience still.I would delight to die beneath your kiss;
     I envy that young maiden who was slain,
   So her warm blood, flowing beneath the kiss,
     Might ease the wounded Sultan of his pain--

   If she loved him as I love you, my Lord.There is no pleasure on the earth so sweet
   As is the pain endured for one adored;
     If I lay crushed beneath your slender feet

   I should be happy!Ah, come soon, come soon,
     See how the stars grow large and white above,
   The land breeze blows across the salt Lagoon,
     There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love.Malay Song

   The Stars await, serene and white,
     The unarisen moon;
   Oh, come and stay with me to-night,
     Beside the salt Lagoon!My hut is small, but as you lie,
     You see the lighted shore,
   And hear the rippling water sigh
     Beneath the pile-raised floor.No gift have I of jewels or flowers,
     My room is poor and bare:
   But all the silver sea is ours,
     And all the scented air

   Blown from the mainland, where there grows
     Th' "Intriguer of the Night,"
   The flower that you have named Tube rose,
     Sweet scented, slim, and white.The flower that, when the air is still
     And no land breezes blow,
   From its pale petals can distil
     A phosphorescent glow.I see your ship at anchor ride;
     Her "captive lightning" shine.Before she takes to-morrow's tide,
     Let this one night be mine!Though in the language of your land
     My words are poor and few,
   Oh, read my eyes, and understand,
     I give my youth to you!The Temple Dancing Girl

   You will be mine; those lightly dancing feet,
     Falling as softly on the careless street
   As the wind-loosened petals of a flower,
     Will bring you here, at the Appointed Hour.And all the Temple's little links and laws
     Will not for long protect your loveliness.I have a stronger force to aid my cause,
     Nature's great Law, to love and to possess!Throughout those sleepless watches, when I lay
     Wakeful, desiring what I might not see,
   I knew (it helped those hours, from dusk to day),
     In this one thing, Fate would be kind to me.You will consent, through all my veins like wine
     This prescience flows; your lips meet mine above,
   Your clear soft eyes look upward into mine
     Dim in a silent ecstasy of love.The clustered softness of your waving hair,
     That curious paleness which enchants me so,
   And all your delicate strength and youthful air,
     Destiny will compel you to bestow!Refuse, withdraw, and hesitate awhile,
     Your young reluctance does but fan the flame;
   My partner, Love, waits, with a tender smile,
     Who play against him play a losing game.I, strong in nothing else, have strength in this,
     The subtlest, most resistless, force we know
   Is aiding me; and you must stoop and kiss:
     The genius of the race will have it so!Yet, make it not too long, nor too intense
     My thirst; lest I should break beneath the strain,
   And the worn nerves, and over-wearied sense,
     Enjoy not what they spent themselves to gain.Lest, in the hour when you consent to share
     That human passion Beauty makes divine,
   I, over worn, should find you over fair,
     Lest I should die before I make you mine.You will consent, those slim, reluctant feet,
     Falling as lightly on the careless street
   As the white petals of a wind-worn flower,
     Will bring you here, at the Appointed Hour.Hira-Singh's Farewell to Burmah

   On the wooden deck of the wooden Junk, silent, alone, we lie,
   With silver foam about the bow, and a silver moon in the sky:
   A glimmer of dimmer silver here, from the anklets round your feet,
   Our lips may close on each other's lips, but never our souls may meet.For though in my arms you lie at rest, your name I have never heard,
   To carry a thought between us two, we have not a single word.And yet what matter we do not speak, when the ardent eyes have spoken,
   The way of love is a sweeter way, when the silence is unbroken.As a wayward Fancy, tired at times, of the cultured Damask Rose,
   Drifts away to the tangled copse, where the wild Anemone grows;
   So the ordered and licit love ashore, is hardly fresh and free
   As this light love in the open wind and salt of the outer sea.So sweet you are, with your tinted cheeks and your small caressive hands,
   What if I carried you home with me, where our Golden Temple stands?Yet, this were folly indeed; to bind, in fetters of permanence,
   A passing dream whose enchantment charms because of its trancience.Life is ever a slave to Time; we have but an hour to rest,
   Her steam is up and her lighters leave, the vessel that takes me west;
   And never again we two shall meet, as we chance to meet to-night,
   On the Junk, whose painted eyes gaze forth, in desolate want of sight.And what is love at its best, but this?Conceived by a passing glance,
   Nursed and reared in a transient mood, on a drifting Sea of Chance.For rudderless craft are all our loves, among the rocks and the shoals,
   Well we may know one another's speech, but never each other's souls.Give here your lips and kiss me again, we have but a moment more,
   Before we set the sail to the mast, before we loosen the oar.Good-bye to you, and my thanks to you, for the rest you let me share,
   While this night drifted away to the Past, to join the Nights that Were.Starlight

   O beautiful Stars, when you see me go
     Hither and thither, in search of love,
   Do you think me faithless, who gleam and glow
     Serene and fixed in the blue above?O Stars, so golden, it is not so.But there is a garden I dare not see,
     There is a place where I fear to go,
   Since the charm and glory of life to me
     The brown earth covered there, long ago.O Stars, you saw it, you know, you know.Hither and thither I wandering go,
     With aimless haste and wearying fret;
   In a search for pleasure and love?Not so,
     Seeking desperately to forget.You see so many, O Stars, you know.Sampan Song

   A little breeze blew over the sea,
       And it came from far away,
   Across the fields of millet and rice,
   All warm with sunshine and sweet with spice,
   It lifted his curls and kissed him thrice,
       As upon the deck he lay.It said, "Oh, idle upon the sea,
       Awake and with sleep have done,
   Haul up the widest sail of the prow,
   And come with me to the rice fields now,
   She longs, oh, how can I tell you how,
       To show you your first-born son!"Song of the Devoted Slave

   There is one God: Mahomed his Prophet.Had I his power
   I would take the topmost peaks of the snow-clad Himalayas,
   And would range them around your dwelling, during the heats of summer,
   To cool the airs that fan your serene and delicate presence,
                   Had I the power.Your courtyard should ever be filled with the fleetest of camels
   Laden with inlaid armour, jewels and trappings for horses,
   Ripe dates from Egypt, and spices and musk from Arabia.And the sacred waters of Zem-Zem well, transported thither,
   Should bubble and flow in your chamber, to bathe the delicate
   Slender and wayworn feet of my Lord, returning from travel,
                   Had I the power.Fine woven silk, from the further East, should conceal your beauty,
   Clinging around you in amorous folds; caressive, silken,
   Beautiful long-lashed, sweet-voiced Persian boys should, kneeling, serve you,
   And the floor beneath your sandalled feet should be smooth and golden,
                   Had I the power.And if ever your clear and stately thoughts should turn to women,
   Kings' daughters, maidens, should be appointed to your caresses,
   That the youth and the strength of my Lord might never be wasted
   In light or sterile love; but enrich the world with his children.Whilst I should sit in the outer court of the Water Palace
   To await the time when you went forth, for Pleasure or Warfare,
   Descending the stairs rose crowned, or armed and arrayed in purple,--
   To mark the place where your steps have fallen, and kiss the footprints,
                   Had I the power.The Singer

   The singer only sang the Joy of Life,
     For all too well, alas!the singer knew
   How hard the daily toil, how keen the strife,
     How salt the falling tear; the joys how few.He who thinks hard soon finds it hard to live,
     Learning the Secret Bitterness of Things:
   So, leaving thought, the singer strove to give
     A level lightness to his lyric strings.He only sang of Love; its joy and pain,
     But each man in his early season loves;
   Each finds the old, lost Paradise again,
     Unfolding leaves, and roses, nesting doves.And though that sunlit time flies all too fleetly,
     Delightful Days that dance away too soon!Its early morning freshness lingers sweetly
     Throughout life's grey and tedious afternoon.And he, whose dreams enshrine her tender eyes,
     And she, whose senses wait his waking hand,
   Impatient youth, that tired but sleepless lies,
     Will read perhaps, and reading, understand.Oh, roseate lips he would have loved to kiss,
     Oh, eager lovers that he never knew!What should you know of him, or words of his?--
     But all the songs he sang were sung for you!Malaria

   He lurks among the reeds, beside the marsh,
     Red oleanders twisted in His hair,
   His eyes are haggard and His lips are harsh,
     Upon His breast the bones show gaunt and bare.The green and stagnant waters lick His feet,
     And from their filmy, iridescent scum
   Clouds of mosquitoes, gauzy in the heat,
     Rise with His gifts: Death and Delirium.His messengers: They bear the deadly taint
     On spangled wings aloft and far away,
   Making thin music, strident and yet faint,
     From golden eve to silver break of day.The baffled sleeper hears th' incessant whine
     Through his tormented dreams, and finds no rest
   The thirsty insects use his blood for wine,
     Probe his blue veins and pasture on his breast.While far away He in the marshes lies,
     Staining the stagnant water with His breath,
   An endless hunger burning in His eyes,
     A famine unassuaged, whose food is Death.He hides among the ghostly mists that float
     Over the water, weird and white and chill,
   And peasants, passing in their laden boat,
     Shiver and feel a sense of coming ill.A thousand burn and die; He takes no heed,
     Their bones, unburied, strewn upon the plain,
   Only increase the frenzy of His greed
     To add more victims to th' already slain.He loves the haggard frame, the shattered mind,
     Gloats with delight upon the glazing eye,
   Yet, in one thing, His cruelty is kind,
     He sends them lovely dreams before they die;

   Dreams that bestow on them their heart's desire,
     Visions that find them mad, and leave them blest,
   To sink, forgetful of the fever's fire,
     Softly, as in a lover's arms, to rest.Fancy

   Far in the Further East the skilful craftsman
       Fashioned this fancy for the West's delight.This rose and azure Dragon, crouching softly
       Upon the satin skin, close-grained and white.And you lay silent, while his slender needles
       Pricked the intricate pattern on your arm,
   Combining deftly Cruelty and Beauty,
       That subtle union, whose child is charm.Charm irresistible: the lovely something
       We follow in our dreams, but may not reach.The unattainable Divine Enchantment,
       Hinted in music, never heard in speech.This from the blue design exhales towards me,
       As incense rises from the Homes of Prayer,
   While the unfettered eyes, allured and rested,
       Urge the forbidden lips to stoop and share;

   Share in the sweetness of the rose and azure
       Traced in the Dragon's form upon the white
   Curve of the arm.Ah, curb thyself, my fancy,
       Where would'st thou drift in this enchanted flight?Feroza

   The evening sky was as green as Jade,
      As Emerald turf by Lotus lake,
   Behind the Kafila far she strayed,
      (The Pearls are lost if the Necklace break!)A lingering freshness touched the air
      From palm-trees, clustered around a Spring,
   The great, grim Desert lay vast and bare,
      But Youth is ever a careless thing.The Raiders threw her upon the sand,
      Men of the Wilderness know no laws,
   They tore the Amethysts off her hand,
      And rent the folds of her veiling gauze.They struck the lips that they might have kissed,
      Pitiless they to her pain and fear,
   And wrenched the gold from her broken wrist,
      No use to cry; there were none to hear.Her scarlet mouth and her onyx eyes,
      Her braided hair in its silken sheen,
   Were surely meet for a Lover's prize,
      But Fate dissented, and stepped between.Across the Zenith the vultures fly,
      Cruel of beak and heavy of wing.This Month the Almonds Bloom at Kandahar

   I hate this City, seated on the Plain,
     The clang and clamour of the hot Bazar,
   Knowing, amid the pauses of my pain,
     This month the Almonds bloom in Kandahar.The Almond-trees, that sheltered my Delight,
     Screening my happiness as evening fell.It was well worth--that most Enchanted Night--
     This life in torment, and the next in Hell!People are kind to me; one More than Kind,
     Her lashes lie like fans upon her cheek,
   But kindness is a burden on my mind,
     And it is weariness to hear her speak.For though that Kaffir's bullet holds me here,
     My thoughts are ever free, and wander far,
   To where the Lilac Hills rise, soft and clear,
     Beyond the Almond Groves of Kandahar.He followed me to Sibi, to the Fair,
     The Horse-fair, where he shot me weeks ago,
   But since they fettered him I have no care
     That my returning steps to health are slow.They will not loose him till they know my fate,
     And I rest here till I am strong to slay,
   Meantime, my Heart's Delight may safely wait
     Among the Almond blossoms, sweet as they.Well, he won by day,
     But I won, what I so desired, by night,
   _My_ arms held what his lack till Judgment Day!Also, the game is not yet over--quite!Wait, Amir Ali, wait till I come forth
     To kill, before the Almond-trees are green,
   To raze thy very Memory from the North,
     _So that thou art not, and thou hast not been!_

   Aha!it is Duty
     To rid the World from Shiah dogs like thee,
   They are but ill-placed moles on Islam's beauty,
     Such as the Faithful cannot calmly see!Also thy bullet hurts me not a little,
     Thy Shiah blood might serve to salve the ill.Maybe some Afghan Promises are brittle;
     Never a Promise to oneself, to kill!Now I grow stronger, I have days of leisure
     To shape my coming Vengeance as I lie,
   And, undisturbed by call of War or Pleasure,
     Can dream of many ways a man may die.I shall not torture thee, thy friends might rally,
     Some Fate assist thee and prove false to me;
   Oh!shouldst thou now escape me, Amir Ali,
     This would torment me through Eternity!Aye, Shuffa-Jan, I will be quiet indeed,
     Give here the Hakim's powder if thou wilt,
   And thou mayst sit, for I perceive thy need,
     And rest thy soft-haired head upon my quilt.Thy gentle love will not disturb a mind
     That loves and hates beneath a fiercer Star.Also, thou know'st, my Heart is left behind,
     Among the Almond-trees of Kandahar!End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of India's Love Lyrics, by 
Adela Florence Cory Nicolson (AKA Laurence Hope), et al.It is too broad and gives too much
scope to the physicians who would do more than "pull bones.""Osteopathy is practical anatomy and physiology skillfully and
scientifically applied as _manual_ treatment of disease."That definition
suits better, because of the "manual treatment."If you are a true
Osteopath you must do it _all_ with your hands.It will not do to use any
mechanical appliances, for if you do you cannot keep up the impression
that you are "handling the body with the skilled touch of a master who
knows every part of his machine.""The human body is a machine run by the unseen force called life, and that
it may run harmoniously it is necessary that there be liberty of blood,
nerves, and arteries from the generating point to destination."This
definition may be impressive to the popular mind, but, upon analysis, we
wonder if any other string of big words might not have had the same
effect."Liberty of blood" is a proposition even a stupid medical man must
admit.Of course, there must be free circulation of blood, and massage, or
hot and cold applications, or exercise, or anything that will stimulate
circulation, is rational.But when "liberty of blood" is mentioned, what
is meant by "liberty of arteries"?"Osteopathy seeks to obtain perfect skeletal alignment and tonic
ligamentous, muscular and facial relaxation."Some Osteopaths and other
therapeutic reformers (?)have contended that medical men purposely used
"big words" and Latin names to confound the laity.What must we think of
the one just given as a popular definition?A good many Osteopaths are becoming disgusted with the big words,
technical terms and "high-sounding nothings" used by so many Osteopathic
writers.The limit of this was never reached, however, until an A.B.,
Ph.D., D.O.wrote an article to elucidate Osteopathy for the general
public in an American encyclopedia.It takes scholarly wisdom to simplify
great truths and bring them to the comprehension of ordinary minds.If
writers for the medical profession want a lesson in the art of simplifying
and popularizing therapeutic science, they should study this article on
Osteopathy in the encyclopedia.A brief history of Osteopathy is perhaps in place.The following summary
is taken from leading Osteopathic journals.As to the personality and
motives of its founders I know but little; of the motives of its leading
promoters a candid public must be the judge.But judgment should be
withheld until all the truth is known.The principles of Osteopathy were discovered by Dr.He was at that time a physician of the old school practicing in
Kansas.His father, brothers and uncles were all medical practitioners.He
was at one time scout surgeon under General Fremont.During the Civil War
he was surgeon in the Union army in a volunteer corps.It was during the
war that he began to lose faith in drugs, and to search for something
natural in combating disease.Then began a long struggle with poverty and abuse.He was obstructed by
his profession and ridiculed by his friends.Fifteen years after the
discovery of Osteopathy found Dr.Still located in the little town of
Kirksville, Mo., where he had gradually attracted a following who had
implicit faith in his power to heal by what to them seemed mysterious
movements.His fame spread beyond the town, and chronic sufferers began to turn
toward Kirksville as a Mecca of healing.Others began to desire Still's
healing powers.In 1892 the American School of Osteopathy was founded,
which from a small beginning has grown until the present buildings and
equipment cost more than $100,000.Hundreds of students are graduated
yearly from this school, and large, well-equipped schools have been
founded in Des Moines, Philadelphia, Boston and California, with a number
of schools of greater or less magnitude scattered in other parts of the
country.More than four thousand Osteopaths were in the field in 1907, and
this number is being augmented every year by a larger number of physicians
than are graduated from Homeopathic colleges, according to Osteopathic
reports.About thirty-five States have given Osteopathy more or less favorable
legal recognition.The discussion of the subject of Osteopathy is of very grave importance.Important to practitioners of the old schools of medicine for reasons I
shall give further on, and of vital importance to the thousands of men and
women who have chosen Osteopathy as their life work.It is even of greater
importance in another sense to the people who are called upon to decide
which system is right, and which school they ought to rely upon when their
lives are at stake.I shall try to speak advisedly and conservatively, as I wish to do no one
injustice.I should be sorry indeed to speak a word that might hinder the
cause of truth and progress.I started out to tell of all that prevents
the sway of truth and honesty in therapeutics.I should come far short of
telling all if I omitted the inconsistencies of this "new science" of
healing that dares to assume the responsibility for human life, and makes
bold to charge that time-tried systems, with their tens of thousands of
practitioners, are wrong, and that the right remedy, or the best remedy
for disease has been unknown through all these years until the coming of
Osteopathy.And further dares to make the still more serious charge that
since the truth has been brought to light, the majority of medical men are
so blinded by prejudice or ignorance that they _will_ not see.This is not the first time I have spoken about inconsistencies in the
practice of Osteopathy.I saw so much of it in a leading Osteopathic
college that when I had finished I could not conscientiously proclaim
myself as an exponent of a "complete and well-rounded system of healing,
adequate for every emergency," as Osteopathy is heralded to be by the
journals published for "Osteopathic physicians" to scatter broadcast among
the people.I practiced Osteopathy for three years, but only as an
Osteopathic specialist.I never during that time accepted responsibility
for human life when I did not feel sure that I could do as much for the
case as any other might do with other means or some other system.Because I practiced as a specialist and would not claim that Osteopathy
would cure everything that any other means might cure, I have never been
called a good disciple of the new science by my brethren.I would not
practice as a grafter, find bones dislocated and "subluxated," and tell
people that they must take two or three months' treatment at twenty-five
dollars per month, to have one or two "subluxations" corrected.In
consequence I was never overwhelmed by the golden stream of prosperity the
literature that made me a convert had assured me would be forthcoming to
all "Osteopathic physicians" of even ordinary ability.As I said, this is not the first time I have spoken of the inconsistencies
of Osteopathy.While yet in active practice I became so disgusted with
some of the shams and pretences that I wrote a long letter to the editor
of an Osteopathic journal published for the good of the profession.This
editor, a bright and capable man, wrote me a nice letter in reply, in
which he agreed with me about quackery and incompetency in our profession.He did not publish the letter I wrote, or express his honest sentiments,
as I had hoped he might.If what I wrote to that editor was the truth, as
he acknowledged in private, it is time the public knew something of it.I
believe, also, that many of the large number of Osteopaths who have been
discouraged or disgusted, and quit the practice, will approve what I am
writing.There is another class of Osteopathic practitioners who, I
believe, will welcome the truth I have to tell.This consists of the large
number of men and women who are practicing Osteopathy as standing for all
that makes up rational physio-therapy.Speaking of those who have quit the practice of Osteopathy, I will say
that they are known by the Osteopathic faculties to be a large and growing
number.Yet Osteopathic literature sent to prospective students tells of
the small per cent.It may not be
known how many fail, but it is known that many have quit.A journey half across one of our Western States disclosed one Osteopath in
the meat business, one in the real estate business, one clerking in a
store, and two, a blind man and his wife, fairly prosperous Osteopathic
physicians.This was along one short line of railroad, and there is no
reason why it may not be taken as a sample of the percentage of those who
have quit in the entire country.I heard three years ago from a bright young man who graduated with honors,
started out with luxurious office rooms in a flourishing city, and was
pointed to as an example of the prosperity that comes to the Osteopath
from the very start.When I heard from him last he was advance
bill-poster for a cheap show.Another bright classmate was carrying a
chain for surveyors in California.I received an Osteopathic journal recently containing a list of names,
about eight hundred of them, of "mossbacks," as we were politely called.I
say "we," for my name was on the list.The journal said these were the
names of Osteopaths whose addresses were lost and no communication could
be had with them.Just for what, aside
from the annual fee to the American Osteopathic Association, was not
clear.I do know what the silence of a good many of them meant.They have quit,
and do not care to read the abuse that some of the Osteopathic journals
are continually heaping upon those who do not keep their names on the
"Who's Who in Osteopathy" list.There is a large percentage of failures in other professions, and it is
not strange that there should be some in Osteopathy.But when Osteopathic
journals dwell upon the large chances of success and prosperity for those
who choose Osteopathy as a profession, those who might become students
should know the other side.THE OSTEOPATHIC PROPAGANDA.Wonderful Growth Claimed to Prove Merit--Osteopathy is Rational
    Physio-Therapy--Growth is in Exact Proportion to Advertising
    Received--Booklets and Journals for Gratuitous
    Distribution--Osteopathy Languishes or Flourishes by Patent Medicine
    Devices--Circular Letter from Secretary of American Osteopathic
    Association--Boosts by Governors and Senators--The Especial Protege of
    Authors--Mark Twain--Opie Reed--Emerson Hough--Sam Jones--The
    Orificial Surgeon--The M.D.Seeking Job as "Professor"--The Lure of
    "Honored Doctor" with "Big Income"--No Competition.Why has it had such a wonderful growth in
popularity?Why have nearly four thousand men and women, most of them
intelligent and some of them educated, espoused it as a profession to
follow as a life work?These are questions I shall now try to answer.Osteopathic promoters and enthusiasts claim that the wonderful growth and
popularity of Osteopathy prove beyond question its merits as a healing
system.I have already dealt at length with reasons why intelligent people
are so ready to fall victims to new systems of healing.The "perfect
adjustment," "perfect functioning" theory of Osteopathy is especially
attractive to people made ripe for some "drugless healing" system by
causes already mentioned.When Osteopathy is practiced as a combination of
all manipulations and other natural aids to the inherent recuperative
powers of the body, it will appeal to reason in such a way and bring such
good results as to make and keep friends.I am fully persuaded, and I believe the facts when presented will
establish it, that it is the physio-therapy in Osteopathy that wins and
holds the favor of intelligent people.But Osteopathy in its own name,
taught as "a well-rounded system of healing adequate for every emergency,"
has grown and spread largely as a "patent medicine" flourishes, _i.e._,
in exact proportion to the advertising it has received.I would not
presume to make this statement as merely my opinion.The question at issue
is too important to be treated as a matter of opinion.I will present
facts, and let my readers settle the point in their own minds.Every week I get booklets or "sample copies" of journals heralding the
wonderful curative powers of Osteopathy.These are published not as
journals for professional reading, but to be sold to the practitioners by
the hundreds or thousands, to be given to their patients for distribution
by these patients to their friends.The publishers of these "boosters"
say, and present testimonials to prove it, that Osteopaths find their
practice languishes or flourishes just in proportion to the numbers of
these journals and booklets they keep circulating in their communities.Here is a sample testimonial I received some time since on a postal card:

    "Gentlemen: Since using your journals more patients have come to me
    than I could treat, many of them coming from neighboring towns.Quite
    a number have had to go home without being treated, leaving their
    names so that they could be notified later, as I can get to them.Your
    booklets bring them O.The boast is often made that Osteopathy is growing in spite of bitter
opposition and persecution, and is doing it on its merits--doing it
because "Truth is mighty and will prevail."At one time I honestly
believed this to be true, but I have been convinced by highest Osteopathic
authority that it is not true.As some of that proof here is an extract
from a circular letter from the secretary of the American Osteopathic
Association:

    "Now, Doctor, we feel that you have the success of Osteopathy at
    heart, and if you realize the activity and complete organization of
    the American Medical Association and their efforts to curb our
    limitations, and do not become a member of this Association, which
    stands opposed to the efforts of the big monopoly, we must believe
    that you are not familiar with the earnestness of the A. O. A. and its
    efforts.We must work in harmonious accord and with an organized
    purpose._When we rest on our oars the death knell begins to sound._
    Can you not see that unless you co-operate with your
    fellow-practitioners in this national effort you are _sounding your
    own limitations_?"This from the _secretary_ of the American Osteopathic Association, when we
have boasted of superior equipment for intelligent physicians.Incidentally we pause to make excuse for the expressions: "Curbing our
limitations" and "sounding your own limitations."But does the idea that when we quit working as an organized body "_our
death knell begins to sound_," indicate that Osteopathic leaders are
content to trust the future of Osteopathy to its merits?If Osteopathic promoters do not feel that the life of their science
depends on boosting, what did the secretary of the A.O.A.mean when he
said, "Upon the success of these efforts depends the weal or woe of
Osteopathy as an independent system"?If truth always grows under
persecution, how can the American Medical Association kill Osteopathy when
it is so well known by the people?Nearly four thousand Osteopaths are scattered in thirty-six States where
they have some legal recognition, and they are treating thousands of
invalids every day.If they are performing the wonderful cures Osteopathic
journals tell of, why are we told that the welfare of the system depends
upon the noise that is made and the boosting that is done?Has it required advertising to keep people using anesthetics since it was
demonstrated that they would prevent pain?Has it required boosting to keep the people resorting to surgery since the
benefits of modern operations have been proved?Does it look as if Osteopathy has been standing or advancing on its
merits?Does it not seem that Osteopathy, as a complete system, is mostly
a _name_, and "lives, moves, and has its being" in boosting?It seems to
have been about the best boosted fad ever fancied by a foolish people.Osteopathic journals have
published again and again the nice things a number of governors said when
they signed the bills investing Osteopathy with the dignity of State
authority.A certain United States senator from Ohio has won more notoriety as a
champion of Osteopathy than he has lasting fame as a statesman.Osteopathy has been the especial protege of authors.Mark Twain once went
up to Albany and routed an army of medical lobbyists who were there to
resist the passage of a bill favorable to Osteopathy.For this heroic deed
Mark is better known to Osteopaths to-day than even for his renowned
history of Huckleberry Finn.He is in danger of losing his reputation as a
champion of the "under dog in the fight."Lately he has gone on the
warpath again.This time to annihilate poor Mother Eddy and her fond
delusion.Opie Reed is a delightful writer while he sticks to the portrayal of droll
Southern character.Ella Wheeler Wilcox is admirable for the beauty and
boldness with which she portrays the passions and emotions of humanity.But they are both better known to Osteopaths for the bouquets they have
tossed at Osteopathy than for their profound human philosophy that used to
be promulgated by the _Chicago American_.Emerson Hough gave a little free advertising in his "Heart's Desire."There may have been "method in his madness," for that Osteopathic horse
doctoring scene no doubt sold many a book for the author.Sam Jones also helped along with some of his striking originality.Sam
said, "There is as much difference between Osteopathy and massage as
between playing a piano and currying a horse."The idea of comparing the
Osteopath's manipulations of the human body to the skilled touch of the
pianist upon his instrument was especially pleasing to Osteopaths.However, Sam displayed about the same comprehension of his subject that
preachers usually exhibit who try to say nice things about the doctors
when they get their doctoring gratis or at reduced rates.These champions of Osteopathy no doubt mean well.They can be excused on
the ground that they got out of place to aid in the cause of "struggling
truth."But what shall we say of medical men, some of them of reputation
and great influence, who uphold and champion new systems under such
conditions that it is questionable whether they do it from principle or
policy?Osteopathic journals have made much of an article written by a famous
"orificial surgeon."The article appears on the first page of a leading
Osteopath journal, and is headed, "An Expert Opinion on Osteopathy."Among
the many good things he says of the "new science" is this: "The full
benefit of a single sitting can be secured in from three to ten minutes
instead of an hour or more, as required by massage."I shall discuss the
time of an average Osteopathic treatment further on, but I should like to
see how long this brother would hold his practice if he were an Osteopath
and treated from three to ten minutes.He also says that "Osteopathy is so beneficial to cases of insanity that
it seems quite probable that this large class of terrible sufferers may be
almost emancipated from their hell."I shall also say more further on of
what I know of Osteopathy's record as an insanity cure.There is this
significant thing in connection with this noted specialist's boost for
Osteopathy.The journal printing this article comments on it in another
number; tells what a great man the specialist is, and incidentally lets
Osteopaths know that if any of them want to add a knowledge of "orificial
surgery" to their "complete science," this doctor is the man from whom to
get it, as he is the "great and only" in his specialty, and is big and
broad enough to appreciate Osteopathy.The most despicable booster of any new system of therapeutics is the
physician who becomes its champion to get a job as "professor" in one of
its colleges.Of course it is a strong temptation to a medical man who has
never made much of a reputation in his own profession.You may ask, "Have there been many such medical men?"Consult the faculty
rolls of the colleges of these new sciences, and you will be surprised, no
doubt, to find how many put M.D.Some of these were honest converts to the system, perhaps.Some wanted
the honor of being "Professor Doctor," maybe, and some may have been lured
by the same bait that attracts so many students into Osteopathic colleges.That is, the positive assurance of "plenty of easy money" in it.One who has studied the real situation in an effort to learn why
Osteopathy has grown so fast as a profession, can hardly miss the
conclusion that advertising keeps the grist of students pouring into
Osteopathic mills.There is scarcely a corner of the United States that
their seductive literature does not reach.Practitioners in the field are
continually reminded by the schools from which they graduated that their
alma mater looks largely to their solicitations to keep up the supply of
recruits.Their advertising, the tales of wonderful cures and big money made, appeal
to all classes.It seems that none are too scholarly and none too ignorant
to become infatuated with the idea of becoming an "honored doctor" with a
"big income."College professors and preachers have been lured from
comfortable positions to become Osteopaths.Shrewd traveling men, seduced
by the picture of a permanent home, have left the road to become
Osteopathic physicians and be "rich and honored."To me, when a student of Osteopathy, it was
pathetic and almost tragic to observe the crowds of men and women who had
been seduced from spheres of drudging usefulness, such as clerking,
teaching, barbering, etc., to become money-making doctors.In their old
callings they had lost all hope of gratifying ambition for fame and
fortune, but were making an honest living.The rosy pictures of honor,
fame and twenty dollars per day, that the numerous Osteopathic circulars
and journals painted, were not to be withstood.These circulars told them that the fields into which they might go and
reap that $20 per day were unlimited.They said: "There are dozens of
ministers ready to occupy each vacant pulpit, and as many applicants for
each vacancy in the schools.Each hamlet has four or five doctors, where
it can support but one.The legal profession is filled to the starving
point.Young licentiates in the older professions all have to pass through
a starving time.The
picture was a rosy dream of triumphant success!When they had mastered the
great science and become "Doctors of Osteopathy," the world was waiting
with open arms and pocketbooks to receive them.THEORY AND PRACTICE OF OSTEOPATHY.Infallible, Touch-the-Button System that Always Cured--Indefinite
    Movements and Manipulations--Wealth of Undeveloped Scientific
    Facts--Osteopaths Taking M.D.Course--The Standpatter and the
    Drifter--The "Lesionist"--"Bone Setting"--"Inhibiting a
    Center"--Chiropractics--"Finest Anatomists in the World"--How to Cure
    Torticollis, Goitre and Enteric Troubles--A Successful
    Osteopath--Timid Old Maids--Osteopathic Philanthropy.Many of them were men and women
with gray heads, who had found themselves stranded at a time of life when
they should have been able to retire on a competency.They had staked
their little all on this last venture, and what was before them if they
should fail heaven only knew.How eagerly they looked forward to the time
when they should have struggled through the lessons in anatomy, chemistry,
physiology, symptomatology and all the rest, and should be ready to
receive the wonderful principles of Osteopathy they were to apply in
performing the miraculous cures that were to make them wealthy and famous.Need I tell the physician who was a conscientious student of anatomy in
his school days, that there was disappointment when the time came to enter
the class in "theory and practice" of Osteopathy?There had been vague ideas of a systematized, infallible, touch-the-button
system that _always_ cured.Instead, we were instructed in a lot of
indefinite movements and manipulations that somehow left us speculating as
to just how much of it all was done for effect.We had heard so often that Osteopathy was a complete satisfying science
_that did things specifically_!Now it began to dawn upon us that there
was indeed a "wealth of undeveloped scientific facts" in Osteopathy, as
those glittering circulars had said when they thought to attract young men
ambitious for original research.They had said, "Much yet remains to be
discovered."Some of us wondered if the "undeveloped" and "undiscovered"
scientific facts were not the main constituents of the "science."The students expected something exact and tangible, and how eagerly they
grasped at anything in the way of bringing quick results in curing the
sick.If Osteopathy is so complete, why did so many students, after they had
received everything the learned (?)professors had to impart, procure
Juettner's "Modern Physio-Therapy" and Ling's "Manual Therapy" and Rosse's
"Cures Without Drugs" and Kellogg's work on "Hydrotherapy"?They felt that
they needed all they could get.It was customary for the students to begin "treating" after they had been
in school a few months, and medical men will hardly be surprised to know
that they worked with more faith in their healing powers and performed
more wonderful (?)cures in their freshman year than they ever did
afterward.I have in mind a student, one of the brightest I ever met, who read a
cheap book on Osteopathic practice, went into a community where he was
unknown, and practiced as an Osteopathic physician.In a few months he had
made enough money to pay his way through an Osteopathic college, which he
entered professing to believe that Osteopathy would cure all the ills
flesh is heir to, but which he left two years later to take a medical
course.degree, but I notice that it is his M.D.Can students be blamed for getting a little weak in faith when men who
told them that the great principles of Osteopathy were sufficient to cure
_everything_, have been known to backslide so far as to go and take
medical courses themselves?How do you suppose it affects students of an Osteopathic college to read
in a representative journal that the secretary of their school, and the
greatest of all its boosters, calls medical men into his own family when
there is sickness in it?There are many men and women practicing to-day who try to be honest and
conscientious, and by using all the good in Osteopathy, massage, Swedish
movements, hydrotherapy, and all the rest of the adjuncts of
physio-therapy, do a great deal of good.The practitioner who does use
these agencies, however, is denounced by the stand-patters as a "drifter."They say he is not a true Osteopath, but a mongrel who is belittling the
great science.That circular letter from the secretary of the American
Osteopathic Association said that one of the greatest needs of
organization was to preserve Osteopathy in its primal purity as it came
from its founder, A. T. Still.If our medical brethren and the laity could read some of the acrimonious
discussions on the question of using adjuncts, they would certainly be
impressed with the exactness (?)There is one idea of Osteopathy that even the popular mind has grasped,
and that is that it is essentially finding "lesions" and correcting them.Yet the question has been very prominent and pertinent among Osteopaths:
"Are you a lesion Osteopath?"Think of it, gentlemen, asking an Osteopath
if he is a "lesionist"!Yet there are plenty of Osteopaths who are stupid
enough (or honest enough) not to be able to find bones "subluxed" every
time they look at a patient.Practitioners who really want to do their
patrons good will use adjuncts even if they are denounced by the
stand-patters.I believe every conscientious Osteopath must sometimes feel that it is
safer to use rational remedies than to rely on "bone setting," or
"inhibiting a center," but for the grafter it is not so spectacular and
involves more hard work.The stand-patters of the American Osteopathic Association have not
eliminated all trouble when they get Osteopaths to stick to the "bone
setting, inhibiting" idea.The chiropractic man threatens to steal their
thunder here.The Chiropractor has found that when it comes to using
mysterious maneuvers and manipulations as bases for mind cure, one thing
is about as good as another, except that the more mysterious a thing
looks the better it works.So the Chiropractor simply gives his healing
"thrusts" or his wonderful "adjustments," touches the buttons along the
spine as it were, when--presto!disease has flown before his healing touch
and blessed health has come to reign instead!The Osteopath denounces the Chiropractor as a brazen fraud who has stolen
all that is good in Chiropractics (if there _is_ anything good) from
Osteopathy.But Chiropractics follows so closely what the "old liner"
calls the true theory of Osteopathy that, between him and the drifter who
gives an hour of crude massage, or uses the forbidden accessories, the
true Osteopath has a hard time maintaining the dignity (?)of Osteopathy
and keeping its practitioners from drifting.Some of the most ardent supporters of true Osteopathy I have ever known
have drifted entirely away from it.After practicing two or three years,
abusing medicine and medical men all the time, and proclaiming to the
people continually that they had in Osteopathy all that a sick world could
ever need, it is suddenly learned that the "Osteopath is gone."He has
"silently folded his tent and stolen away," and where has he gone?He has
gone to a medical college to study that same medicine he has so
industriously abused while he was gathering in the shekels as an
Osteopath.Going to learn and practice the science he has so persistently
denounced as a fraud and a curse to humanity.The intelligent, conscientious Osteopath who dares to brave the scorn of
the stand-patter and use all the legitimate adjuncts of Osteopathy found
in physio-therapy, may do a great deal of good as a physician.I have
found many physicians willing to acknowledge this, and even recommend the
services of such an Osteopath when physio-therapy was indicated.When a physician, however, meets a fellow who claims to have in his
Osteopathy a wonderful system, complete and all-sufficient to cope with
any and all diseases, and that his system is founded on a knowledge of the
relation and function of the various parts and organs of the body such as
no other school of therapeutics has ever been able to discover, then he
knows that he has met a man of the same mental and moral calibre as the
shyster in his own school.He knows he has met a fellow who is exploiting
a thing, that may be good in its way and place, as a graft.And he knows
that this grafter gets his wonderful cures largely as any other quack gets
his; the primary effects of his "scientific manipulations" are on the
minds of those treated.The intelligent physician knows that the Osteopath got his boastedly
superior knowledge of anatomy mostly from the same text-books and same
class of cadavers that other physicians had to master if they graduated
from a reputable school.All that talk we have heard so much about the
Osteopaths being the "finest anatomists in the world" sounds plausible,
and is believed by the laity generally.The quotation I gave above has been much used in Osteopathic literature
as coming from an eminent medical man.What foundation is there for such a
belief?The Osteopath _may_ be a good anatomist.He has about the same
opportunities to learn anatomy the medical student has.If he is a good
and conscientious student he may consider his anatomy of more importance
than does the medical student who is not expecting to do much surgery.If
he is a natural shyster and shirk he can get through a course in
Osteopathy and get his diploma, and this diploma may be about the only
proof he could ever give that he is a "superior anatomist."Great stress has always been laid by Osteopaths upon the amount of study
and research done by their students on the cadaver.I want to give you
some specimens of the learning of the man (an M.D.)who presided over the
dissecting-room when I pursued my "profound research" on the "lateral
half."This great man, whose superior knowledge of anatomy, I presume,
induced by the wise management of the college to employ him as a
demonstrator, in an article written for the organ of the school expresses
himself thus:

    "It is needless to say that the first impression of an M. D. would not
    be favorable to Osteopathy, because he has spent years fixing in his
    mind that if you had a bad case of torticollis not to touch it, but
    give a man morphine or something of the same character with an
    external blister or hot application and in a week or ten days he would
    be all right.In the meanwhile watch the patient's general health,
    relieve the induced constipation by suitable means and rearrange what
    he has disarranged in his treatment.On the other hand, let the
    Osteopath get hold of this patient, and with his _vast_ and we might
    say _perfect_ knowledge of anatomy, he at once, with no other tools
    than his hands, inhibits the nerves supplying the affected parts, and
    in five minutes the patient can freely move his head and shoulders,
    entirely relieved from pain.Would
    he not feel like wiping off the earth with all the Osteopaths?Doctor,
    with your medical education a course in Osteopathy would teach you
    that it is not necessary to subject your patients to myxedema by
    removing the thyroid gland to cure goitre.You would not have to lie
    awake nights studying means to stop one of those troublesome bowel
    complaints in children, nor to insist upon the enforced diet in
    chronic diarrhea, and a thousand other things which are purely
    physiological and are not done by any magical presto change, but by
    methods which are perfectly rational if you will only listen long
    enough to have them explained to you.I will agree that at first
    impression all methods look alike to the medical man, but when
    explained by an intelligent teacher they will bring their just
    reward."Gentlemen of the medical profession, study the above
carefully--punctuation, composition, profound wisdom and all.Surely you
did not read it when it was given to the world a few years ago, or you
would all have been converted to Osteopathy then, and the medical
profession left desolate.We have heard many bad things of medical men,
but never (until we learned it from one who was big-brained enough to
accept Osteopathy when its great truths dawned upon him) did we know that
you are so dull of intellect that it takes you "years to fix in your minds
that if you had a bad case of torticollis not to touch it but to give a
man morphine."And how pleased Osteopaths are to learn from this scholar that the
Osteopath can "take hold" of a case of torticollis, "and with his vast and
we might say perfect knowledge of anatomy" inhibit the nerves and have the
man cured in five minutes.We were glad to learn this great truth from
this learned ex-M.D., as we never should have known, otherwise, that
Osteopathy is so potent.I have had cases of torticollis in my practice, and thought I had done
well if after a half hour of hard work massaging contracted muscles I had
benefited the case.And note the relevancy of these questions, "Would not the medical man be
angry?Would he not feel like wiping off the earth all the Osteopaths?"Gentlemen, can you explain your ex-brother's meaning here?Surely you are
not all so hard-hearted that you would be angry because a poor wry-necked
fellow had been cured in five minutes.To be serious, I ask you to think of "the finest anatomists in the world"
doing their "original research" work in the dissecting-room under the
direction of a man of the scholarly attainments indicated by the
composition and thought of the above article.Do you see now how
Osteopaths get a "vast and perfect knowledge of anatomy"?Do you suppose that the law of "the survival of the fittest" determines
who continues in the practice of Osteopathy and succeeds?Is it true worth
and scholarly ability that get a big reputation of success among medical
men?I know, and many medical men know from competition with him (if they
would admit that such a fellow may be a competitor), that the ignoramus
who as a physician is the product of a diploma mill often has a bigger
reputation and performs more wonderful cures (?)than the educated
Osteopath who really mastered the prescribed course but is too
conscientious to assume responsibility for human life when he is not sure
that he can do all that might be done to save life.I once met an Osteopath whose literary attainments had never reached the
rudiments of an education.He had never really comprehended a single
lesson of his entire course.He told me that he was then on a vacation to
get much-needed rest.He had such a large practice that the physical labor
of it was wearing him out.I knew of this fellow's qualifications, but I
thought he might be one of those happy mortals who have the faculty of
"doing things," even if they cannot learn the theory.To learn the secret
of this fellow's success, if I could, I let him treat me.I had some
contracted muscles that were irritating nerves and holding joints in tense
condition, a typical case, if there are any, for an Osteopathic treatment.I expected him to do some of that
"expert Osteopathic diagnosing" that you have heard of, but he began in an
aimless desultory way, worked almost an hour, found nothing specific, did
nothing but give me a poor unsystematic massage.He was giving me a
"popular treatment."In many towns people have come to estimate the value of an Osteopathic
treatment by its duration.People used to say to me, "You don't treat as
long as Dr.----, who was here before you," and say it in a way indicating
that they were hardly satisfied they had gotten their money's worth.Some
of them would say: "He treated me an hour for seventy-five cents."Does it
seem funny to talk of adjusting lesions on one person for an hour at a
time, three times a week?My picture of incompetency and apparent success of incompetents, is not
overdrawn.The other day I had a marked copy of a local paper from a town
in California.It was a flattering write-up of an old classmate.The
doctor's automobile was mentioned, and he had marked with a cross a fine
auto shown in a picture of the city garage.This fellow had been
considered by all the Simple Simon of the class, inferior in almost every
attribute of true manliness, yet now he flourishes as one of those of our
class to whose success the school can "point with pride."It is interesting to read the long list of "changes of location" among
Osteopaths, yet between the lines there is a sad story that may be read.First, "Doctor Blank has located
in Philadelphia, with twenty-five patients for the first month and rapidly
growing practice."A year or so after another item tells that "Doctor
Blank has located in San Francisco with bright prospects."Then "Doctor
Blank has returned to Missouri on account of his wife's health, and
located in ----, where he has our best wishes for success."Their career
reminds us of Goldsmith's lines:

  "As the hare whom horn and hounds pursue
  Pants to the place from whence at first he flew."There has been many a tragic scene enacted upon the Osteopathic stage, but
the curtain has not been raised for the public to behold them.How many
timid old maids, after saving a few hundred dollars from wages received
for teaching school, have been persuaded that they could learn Osteopathy
while their shattered nerves were repaired and they were made young and
beautiful once more by a course of treatment in the clinics of the school.Then they would be ready to go out to occupy a place of dignity and honor,
and treat ten to thirty patients per month at twenty-five dollars per
patient.Gentlemen of the medical profession, from what you know of the aggressive
spirit that it takes to succeed in professional life to-day (to say
nothing of the physical strength required in the practice of Osteopathy),
what per cent.of these timid old maids do you suppose have "panted to the
place from whence at first they flew," after leaving their pitiful little
savings with the benefactors of humanity who were devoting their splendid
talents to the cause of Osteopathy?If any one doubts that some Osteopathic schools are conducted from other
than philanthropic motives, let him read what the _Osteopathic Physician_
said of a new school founded in California.Of all the fraud, bare-faced
shystering, and flagrant rascality ever exposed in any profession, the
circumstances of the founding of this school, as depicted by the editor of
the _Osteopathic Physician_, furnishes the most disgusting instance.Men
to whom we had clung when the anchor of our faith in Osteopathy seemed
about to drag were held up before us as sneaking, cringing, incompetent
rascals, whose motives in founding the school were commercial in the worst
sense.And how do you suppose Osteopaths out in the field of practice feel
when they receive catalogues from the leading colleges that teach their
system, and these catalogues tell of the superior education the colleges
are equipped to give, and among the pictures of learned members of the
faculty they recognize the faces of old schoolmates, with glasses, pointed
beards and white ties, silk hats maybe, but the same old classmate
of--sometimes not ordinary ability.I spoke a moment ago of old maids being induced to believe that they would
be made over in the clinics of an Osteopathic college.An Osteopathic journal before me says: "If it were generally
known that Osteopathy has a wonderfully rejuvenating effect upon fading
beauty, Osteopathic physicians would be overworked as beauty doctors."Another journal says: "If the aged could know how many years might be
added to their lives by Osteopathy, they would not hesitate to avail
themselves of treatment."A leading D. O. discusses consumption as treated Osteopathically, and
closes his discussion with the statement in big letters: "CONSUMPTION CAN
BE CURED."Another Osteopathic doctor says the curse that was placed upon Mother Eve
in connection with the propagation of the race has been removed by
Osteopathy, and childbirth "positively painless" is a consummated fact.The insane emancipated from
their hell!Asthma
cured by moving a bone!What more in therapeutics is left to be desired?CHAPTER X.

OSTEOPATHY AS RELATED TO SOME OTHER FAKES.Sure Shot Rheumatism Cure--Regular Practitioner's
    Discomfiture--Medicines Alone Failed to Cure Rheumatism--Osteopathy
    Relieves Rheumatic and Neuralgic Pains--"Move Things"--"Pop" Stray
    Cervical Vertebrae--Find Something Wrong and Put it Right--Terrible
    Neck-Wrenching, Bone-Twisting Ordeal.A discussion of graft in connection with doctoring would not be complete
if nothing were said about the traveling medicine faker.Every summer our
towns are visited by smooth-tongued frauds who give free shows on the
streets.They harangue the people by the hour with borrowed spiels, full
of big medical terms, and usually full of abuse of regular practitioners,
which local physicians must note with humiliation is too often received by
people without resentment and often with applause.Only last summer I was standing by while one of these grafters was making
his spiel, and gathering dollars by the pocketful for a "sure shot"
rheumatism cure.His was a _sure_ cure, doubly guaranteed; no cure, money
all refunded (if you could get it).A physician standing near laughed
rather a mirthless laugh, and remarked that Barnum was right when he said,
"The American people like to be humbugged."When the medical man left, a
man who had just become the happy possessor of enough of the wonderful
herb to make a quart of the rheumatism router, remarked: "He couldn't be a
worse humbug than that old duffer.He doctored me for six weeks, and told
me all the time that his medicine would cure me in a few days.I got worse
all the time until I went to Dr.----, who told me to use a sack of hot
bran mash on my back, and I was able to get around in two days."In this man's remarks there is an explanation of the reason the crowd
laughed when they heard the quack abusing the regular practitioner, and of
the reason the people handed their hard-earned dollars to the grafter at
the rate of forty in ten minutes, by actual count.If all doctors were
honest and told the people what all authorities have agreed upon about
rheumatism, _i.e._, that internal medication does it little good, and the
main reliance must be on external application, traveling and patent
medicine fakers who make a specialty of rheumatism cure would be "put out
of business," and there would be eliminated one source of much loss of
faith in medicine.I learned by experience as an Osteopath that many people lose faith in
medicine and in the honesty of physicians because of the failure of
medicine to cure rheumatism where the physician had promised a cure.Patients afflicted with other diseases get well anyway, or the sexton puts
them where they cannot tell people of the physician's failure to cure
them.The rheumatic patient lives on, and talks on of "Doc's" failure to
stop his rheumatic pains.All doctors know that rheumatism is the
universal disease of our fickle climate.If it were not for rheumatic
pains, and neuralgic pains that often come from nerves irritated by
contracted muscles, the Osteopath in the average country town would get
more lonesome than he does.People who are otherwise skeptical concerning
the merits of Osteopathy will admit that it seems rational treatment for
rheumatism.Yet this is a disease that Osteopathy of the specific-adjustment,
bone-setting, nerve-inhibiting brand has little beneficial effect upon.All the Osteopathic treatments I ever gave or saw given in cases of
rheumatism that really did any good, were long, laborious massages.The
medical man who as "professor" in an Osteopathic college said, "When the
Osteopath with his _vast_ knowledge of anatomy gets hold of a case of
torticollis he inhibits the nerves and cures it in five minutes," was
talking driveling rot.I have seen some of the best Osteopaths treat wry-neck, and the work they
did was to knead and stretch and pull, which by starting circulation and
working out soreness, gradually relieved the patient.A hot application,
by expanding tissues and stimulating circulation, would have had the same
effect, perhaps more slowly manifested.To call any Osteopathic treatment massage is always resented as an insult
by the guardians of the science.What is the Osteopath doing, who rolls
and twists and pulls and kneads for a full hour, if he isn't giving a
massage treatment?Of course, it sounds more dignified, and perhaps helps
to "preserve the purity of Osteopathy as a separate system," to call it
"reducing subluxations," "correcting lesions," "inhibiting and
stimulating" nerves.The treatment also acts better as a placebo to call
it by these names.As students we were taught that all Osteopathic movements were primarily
to adjust something.Some of us worried for fear we wouldn't know when the
adjusting was complete.We were told that all the movements we were taught
to make were potent to "move things," so we worried again for fear we
might move something in the wrong direction.We were assured, however,
that since the tendency was always toward the normal, all we had to do was
to agitate, stir things up a bit, and the thing out of place would find
its place.We were told that when in the midst of our "agitation" we heard something
"pop," we could be sure the thing out of place had gone back.When a
student had so mastered the great bone-setting science as to be able to
"pop" stray cervical vertebrae he was looked upon with envy by the fellows
who had not joined the association for protection against suits for
malpractice, and did not know just how much of an owl they could make of a
man and not break his neck.The fellow who lacked clairvoyant powers to locate straying things, and
could not always find the "missing link" of the spine, could go through
the prescribed motions just the same.If he could do it with sufficient
facial contortions to indicate supreme physical exertion, and at the same
time preserve the look of serious gravity and professional importance of a
quack medical doctor giving _particular_ directions for the dosing of the
placebo he is leaving, he might manage to make a sound vertebra "pop."This, with his big show of doing something, has its effect on the
patient's mind anyway.We were taught that Osteopathy was applied common sense, that it was all
reasonable and rational, and simply meant "finding something wrong and
putting it right."Some of us thought it only fair to tell our patients
what we were trying to do, and what we did it for.There is where we made
our big mistake.To say we were relaxing muscles, or trying to lift and
tone up a rickety chest wall, or straighten a warped spine, was altogether
too simple.It was like telling a man that you were going to give him a
dose of oil for the bellyache when he wanted an operation for
appendicitis.It was too common, and some would go to an Osteopath who
could find vertebra and ribs and hips displaced, something that would make
the community "sit up and take notice."If one has to be sick, why not
have something worth while?Where Osteopathy has always been so administered that people have the idea
that it means to find things out of place and put them back, it is a
gentleman's job, professional, scientific and genteel.Men have been known
to give twenty to forty treatments a day at two dollars per treatment.In
many communities, however, the adjustment idea has so degenerated that to
give an Osteopathic treatment is no job for a high collar on a hot day.To
strip a hard-muscled, two-hundred-pound laborer down to a
perspiration-soaked and scented undershirt, and manipulate him for an hour
while he has every one of his five hundred work-hardened muscles rigidly
set to protect himself from the terrible neck-wrenching, bone-twisting
ordeal he has been told an Osteopathic treatment would subject him to--I
say when you have tried that sort of a thing for an hour you will conclude
that an Osteopathic treatment is no job for a kid-gloved dandy nor for a
lily-fingered lady, as it has been so glowingly pictured.I know the brethren will say that true Osteopathy does not give an hour's
shotgun treatment, but finds the lesion, corrects it, collects its two
dollars, and quits until "day after to-morrow," when it "corrects" and
_collects_ again as long as there is anything to co--llect!I practiced for three years in a town where people made their first
acquaintance with Osteopathy through the treatments of a man who
afterwards held the position of demonstrator of Osteopathic "movements"
and "manipulations" in one of the largest and boastedly superior schools
of Osteopathy.The people certainly should have received correct ideas of
Osteopathy from him.He was followed in the town by a bright young fellow
from "Pap's" school, where the genuine "lesion," blown-in-the-bottle brand
of Osteopathy has always been taught.This fellow was such an excellent
Osteopath that he made enough money in two years to enable him to quit
Osteopathy forever.This he did, using the money he had gathered as an
Osteopath to take him through a medical college.I followed these two shining lights who I supposed had established
Osteopathy on a correct basis.I started in to give specific treatments as
I had been taught to do; that is, to hunt for the lesion, correct it if I
found it, and quit, even if I had not been more than fifteen or twenty
minutes at it.I found that in many cases my patients were not satisfied.I did not know just what was the matter at first, and lost some desirable
patients (lost their patronage, I mean--they were not in much danger of
dying when they came to me).I was soon enlightened, however, by some more
outspoken than the rest.They said I did not "treat as long as that other
doctor," and when I had done what I thought was indicated at times a
patient would say, "You didn't give me that neck-twisting movement," or
that "leg-pulling treatment."No matter what I thought was indicated, I
had to give all the movements each time that had ever been given before.A physician who has had to dose out something he knew would do no good,
just to satisfy the patient and keep him from sending for another doctor
who he feared might give something worse, can appreciate the violence done
a fellow's conscience as he administers those wonderfully curative
movements.He cannot, however, appreciate the emotions that come from the
strenuous exertion over a sweaty body in a close room on a July day.Incidentally, this difference in the physical exertion necessary to get
the same results has determined a good many to quit Osteopathy and take up
medicine.A young man who had almost completed a course in Osteopathy told
me he was going to study medicine when he had finished Osteopathy, as he
had found that giving "treatments was too d----d hard work."TAPEWORMS AND GALLSTONES.Plug-hatted Faker--Frequency of Tapeworms--Some Tricks Exposed--How

    Cure--Relation to Osteopathy--Perfect, Self-Oiling, "Autotherapeutic"
    Machine--Touch the Button--The Truth About the Consumption and
    Insanity Cures.There is another trump card the traveling medical grafter plays, which
wins about as well as the guaranteed rheumatism cure, namely, the tapeworm
fraud.Last summer I heard a plug-hatted faker delivering a lecture to a
street crowd, in which he said that every mother's son or daughter of them
who didn't have the rosy cheek, the sparkling eye and buoyancy of youth
might be sure that a tapeworm of monstrous size was, "like a worm in the
bud," feeding on their "damask cheeks."To prove his assertion and lend
terror to his tale, he held aloft a glass jar containing one of the
monsters that had been driven from its feast on the vitals of its victim
by his never-failing remedy.The person, "saved from a living death,"
stood at the "doctor's" side to corroborate the story, while his
voluptuous wife was kept busy handing out the magical remedy and "pursing
the ducats" given in return.How this one was secured I do not know; but
intelligent people ought to know that cases of tapeworm are not so common
that eight people out of every ten have one, as this grafter positively
asserted.An acquaintance once traveled with one of these tapeworm specialists to
furnish the song and dance performances that are so attractive to the
class of people who furnish the ready victims for grafters.The "specialist" would pick out an emaciated,
credulous individual from his crowd, and tell him that he bore the
unmistakable marks of being the prey of a terrible tapeworm.If he
couldn't sell him a bottle of his worm eradicator, he would give him a
bottle, telling him to take it according to directions and report to him
at his hotel or tent the next day.The man would report that no dead or
dying worm had been sighted.The man was told that if he had taken the medicine as directed the
worm was dead beyond a doubt, but sometimes the "fangs" were fastened so
firmly to the walls of the intestines, in their death agony, that they
would not come away until he had injected a certain preparation that
_always_ "produced the goods."The man was taken into a darkened room for privacy (?), the injection
given, and the defunct worm always came away.At least a worm was always
found in the evacuated material, and how was the deluded one to know that
it was in the vessel or matter injected?Of course, the patient felt
wondrous relief, and was glad to stand up that night and testify that Dr.Grafter was an angel of mercy sent to deliver him from the awful fate of
living where "the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched."I was told recently of a new tapeworm graft that makes the old one look
crude and unscientific.This one actually brings a tapeworm from the
intestines in _every_ case, whether the person had one before the magic
remedy was given or not.The graft is to have a near-worm manufactured of
delicate rubber and compressed into a capsule.The patient swallows the
capsule supposed to contain the worm destroyer.The rubber worm is not
digested, and a strong physic soon produces it, to the great relief of the
"patient" and the greater glory and profit of the shyster.What a
wonderful age of invention and scientific discoveries!Another journal tells of a new gallstone cure that never fails to cause
the stones to be passed even if they are big as walnuts.The graft in this
is that the medicine consists of paraffine dissolved in  oil.The
paraffine does not digest, but collects in  balls, which are passed
by handfuls and are excellent imitations of the real things.How about tapeworms, gallstones and Osteopathy, do you ask?We heard about tapeworms and gallstones when we were in Osteopathic
college.The one thing that was ground into us early and thoroughly was that
Osteopathy was a complete system.No matter what any other system had
done, we were to remember that Osteopathy could do that thing more surely
and more scientifically.Students soon learned that they were never to ask, "_Can_ we treat this?"That indicated skepticism, which was intolerable in the atmosphere of
optimistic faith that surrounded the freshman and sophomore classes
especially.The question was to be put, "_How_ do we treat this?"In the
treatment of worms the question was, "How do we treat worms?"Had not nature made a machine, perfect in all its parts,
self-oiling, "autotherapeutic," and all that?And would nature allow it to
choke up or slip a cog just because a little thing like a worm got tangled
in its gearing?Nature knew that worms would intrude, and had
provided her own vermifuge.The cause of worms is insufficient bile, and
behold, all the Osteopath had to do when he wished to serve notice on the
aforesaid worms to vacate the premises was to touch the button controlling
the stop-cock to the bile-duct, and they left.It was so simple and easy
we wondered how the world could have been so long finding it out.That was the proposition on which we were to
stand.If anything had to be removed, or brought back, or put in place,
all that was necessary was to open the floodgates, release the pent-up
forces of nature, and the thing was done!What a happy condition, to have _perfect_ faith!I remember a report came
to our school of an Osteopathic physician who read a paper before a
convention of his brethren, in which he recorded marvelous cures performed
in cases of tuberculosis.The paper was startling, even revolutionary, yet
it was not too much for our faith.We were almost indignant at some who
ventured to suggest that curing consumption by manipulation might be
claiming too much.These wonderful cures were performed in a town which I
afterward visited.I could find no one who knew of a single case that had
been cured.There were those who knew of cases of tuberculosis he had
treated, that had gone as most other bad cases of that disease go.It is one of the main cases, from
all that I can learn, upon which all the bold claims of Osteopathy as an
insanity cure are based.I remember an article under scare headlines big
enough for a bloody murder, flared out in the local paper.It was yet more
wonderfully heralded in the papers at the county seat.The metropolitan
dailies caught up the echo, which reverberated through Canada and was
finally heard across the seas!Osteopathic journals took it up and made
much of it.Those in school read it with eager satisfaction, and plunged
into their studies with fiercer enthusiasm.Many who had been "almost
persuaded" were induced by it to "cross the Rubicon," and take up the
study of this wonderful new science that could take a raving maniac,
condemned to a mad house by medical men, and with a few scientific twists
of the neck cause raging insanity to give place to gentle sleep that
should wake in sanity and health.Was it any wonder that students flocked to schools that professed to teach
how common plodding mortals could work such miracles?Was it strange that
anxious friends brought dear ones, over whom the black cloud of insanity
cast its shadows, hundreds of miles to be treated by this man?Or to the
Osteopathic colleges, from which, in all cases of which I ever knew, they
returned sadly disappointed?The report of that wonderful cure caused many intelligent laymen (and even
Dr.Pratt) to indulge a hope that insanity might be only a disturbance of
the blood supply to the brain caused by pressure from distorted "neck
bones," or other lesions, and that Osteopaths were to empty our
overcrowded madhouses.I
was told by an intimate friend of this great Osteopath that all these
startling reports we had supposed were published as news the papers were
glad to get because of their important truths, were but shrewd
advertising.I afterward talked with the man, and his friends who were at
the bedside when the miracle was performed, and while they believed that
there had been good done by the treatment, it was all so tame and
commonplace at home compared with its fame abroad that I have wondered
ever since if anything much was really done after all.Honesty--Plain Dealing--Education.I could multiply incidents, but it would grow
monotonous.I believe I have told enough that is disgusting to the
intelligent laity and medical men, and enough that is humiliating to the
capable, honest Osteopath, who practices his "new science" as standing for
all that is good in physio-therapy.I hope I have told, or recalled, something that will help physicians to
see that the way to clear up the turbidity existing in therapeutics to-day
is by open, honest dealing with the laity, and by a campaign of education
that shall impart to them enough of the scientific principles of medicine
so that they may know when they are being imposed upon by quacks and
grafters.I am encouraged to believe I am on the right track.After I had
written this booklet I read, in a report of the convention of the American
Medical Association held in Chicago, that one of the leaders of the
Association told his brethren that the most important work before them as
physicians was to conduct a campaign of education for the masses.It must
be done not only to protect the people, but as well to protect the honest
physician.There is another fact that faces the medical profession, and I believe I
have called attention to conditions that prove it.That is, that the hope
of the profession of "doctoring" being placed on an honest rational basis
lies in a broader and more thorough education of the physician.A broad,
liberal general education to begin with, then all that can be known about
medicine and surgery.Then all that there is in
physio-therapy, under whatsoever name, that promises to aid in curing or
preventing disease.If this humble production aids but a little in any of this great work,
then my object in writing will have been achieved.So, without change but from
pause to outbreak, outbreak to pause, nights and days went by in
the siege.One morning, indeed, the fragments of another blunt
arrow came to light, broken underfoot and trampled into the dust.The
paper scroll, in tatters, held only a few marks legible through dirt and
heel-prints: "Listen--work fast--many bags--watch closely."And still
nothing happened to explain the warning.That night Heywood even made a sortie, and stealing from the main gate
with four coolies, removed to the river certain relics that lay close
under the wall, and would soon become intolerable.He had returned
safely, with an ancient musket, a bag of bullets, a petroleum squirt,
and a small bundle of pole-axes, and was making his tour of the
defenses, when he stumbled over Rudolph, who knelt on the ground under
what in old days had been the chapel, and near what now was
Kempner's grave.He was not kneeling in devotion, for he took Heywood by the arm, and
made him stoop."I was coming," he said, "to find you.The first night, I saw coolies
working in the clay-pit."They're keeping such a racket outside," he muttered; and then, half to
himself: "It certainly is.Rudie, it's--it's as if poor Kempner
were--waking up."The two friends sat up, and eyed each other in the starlight.CHAPTER XIX


BROTHER MOLES

This new danger, working below in the solid earth, had thrown Rudolph
into a state of sullen resignation.What was the use now, he thought
indignantly, of all their watching and fighting?The ground, at any
moment, might heave, break, and spring up underfoot.He waited for his
friend to speak out, and put the same thought roundly into words.Instead, to his surprise, he heard something quite contrary."Now we know what
the beasts have up their sleeve.He sat thinking, a white figure in the starlight, cross-legged like a
Buddha."That's why they've all been lying doggo," he continued."And then their
bad marksmanship, with all this sniping--they don't care, you see,
whether they pot us or not.They'd rather make one clean sweep, and
'blow us at the moon.'Cheer up, Rudie: so long as they're digging,
they're not blowing.While he spoke, the din outside the walls wavered and sank, at last
giving place to a shrill, tiny interlude of insect voices.In this
diluted silence came now and then a tinkle of glass from the dark
hospital room where Miss Drake was groping among her vials."If it weren't for that," he said quietly, "I shouldn't much care.Except for the women, this would really be great larks."Then, as a
shadow flitted past the orange grove, he roused himself to hail: "Ah
Pat!Go catchee four piecee coolie-man!"The shadow passed, and after a time returned with four other
shadows.They stood waiting, till Heywood raised his head from the dust."Those noises have stopped, down there," he said to Rudolph; and rising,
gave his orders briefly.The coolies were to dig, strike into the
sappers' tunnel, and report at once: "Chop-chop.--Meantime, Rudie, let's
take a holiday.A solitary candle burned in the far corner of the inclosure, and cast
faint streamers of reflection along the wet flags, which, sluiced with
water from the well, exhaled a slight but grateful coolness.Heywood
stooped above the quivering flame, lighted a cigar, and sinking loosely
into a chair, blew the smoke upward in slow content."Nothing to do, nothing to fret about, till the
compradore reports.For a long time, lying side by side, they might have been asleep.Through the dim light on the white walls dipped and swerved the drunken
shadow of a bat, who now whirled as a flake of blackness across the
stars, now swooped and set the humbler flame reeling.The flutter of his
leathern wings, and the plash of water in the dark, where a coolie still
drenched the flags, marked the sleepy, soothing measures in a nocturne,
broken at strangely regular intervals by a shot, and the crack of a
bullet somewhere above in the deserted chambers."Queer," mused Heywood, drowsily studying his watch."The beggar puts
one shot every five minutes through the same window.--I wonder what he's
thinking about?Lying out there, firing at the Red-Bristled Ghosts.Wonder what they're all"--He put back his cigar, mumbling."Handful of
poor blackguards, all upset in their minds, and sweating round.And all
the rest tranquil as ever, eh?--the whole country jogging on the same
old way, or asleep and dreaming dreams, perhaps, same kind of dreams
they had in Marco Polo's day."The end of his cigar burned red again; and again, except for that, he
might have been asleep.Rudolph made no answer, but lay thinking.This
brief moment of rest in the cool, dim courtyard--merely to lie there
and wait--seemed precious above all other gain or knowledge.Some quiet
influence, a subtle and profound conviction, slowly was at work in him.It was patience, wonder, steady confidence,--all three, and more.He had
felt it but this once, obscurely; might die without knowing it in
clearer fashion; and yet could never lose it, or forget, or come to any
later harm.With it the stars, above the dim vagaries of the bat, were
brightly interwoven.For the present he had only to lie ready, and wait,
a single comrade in a happy army.Through a dark little door came Miss Drake, all in white, and moving
quietly, like a symbolic figure of evening, or the genius of the place.Her hair shone duskily as she bent beside the candle, and with steady
fingers tilted a vial, from which amber drops fell slowly into a glass.With dark eyes watching closely, she had the air of a young, beneficent
Medea, intent on some white magic."Aren't you coming," called Heywood, "to sit with us awhile?""Can't, thanks," she replied, without looking up.She moved away, carrying her medicines, but paused in the door, smiled
back at him as from a crypt, and said:--

"Have _you_ been hurt?""I've no time," she laughed, "for lazy able-bodied persons."And she was
gone in the darkness, to sit by her wounded men.With her went the interval of peace; for past the well-curb came another
figure, scuffing slowly toward the light.The compradore, his robes lost
in their background, appeared as an oily face and a hand beckoning with
downward sweep.The two friends rose, and followed him down the
courtyard.In passing out, they discovered the padre's wife lying
exhausted in a low chair, of which she filled half the length and all
the width.Heywood paused beside her with some friendly question, to
which Rudolph caught the answer.Her voice sounded fretful, her fan stirred weakly.I feel quite ready to suffer for the faith."Earle," said the young man, gently, "there ought to be no
need.Under the orange trees, he laid an unsteady hand on Rudolph's arm, and
halting, shook with quiet merriment.Loose earth underfoot warned them not to stumble over the new-raised
mound beside the pit, which yawned slightly blacker than the night.Kempner's grave had not been quieter.The compradore stood whispering:
they had found the tunnel empty, because, he thought, the sappers were
gone out to eat their chow."We'll see, anyway," said Heywood, stripping off his coat.He climbed
over the mound, grasped the edges, and promptly disappeared.In the long
moment which followed, the earth might have closed on him.Once, as
Rudolph bent listening over the shaft, there seemed to come a faint
momentary gleam; but no sound, and no further sign, until the head and
shoulders burrowed up again."Big enough hole down there," he reported, swinging clear, and sitting
with his feet in the shaft.Three sacks of powder stowed
already, so we're none too soon.--One sack was leaky.I struck a match,
and nearly blew myself to Casabianca.""It
gives us a plan, though.Rudie: are you game for something rather
foolhardy?Be frank, now; for if you wouldn't really enjoy it, I'll give
old Gilly Forrester his chance."said Rudolph, stung as by some perfidy.This is all ours, this part, so!"Give me half a
moment start, so that you won't jump on my head."And he went wriggling
down into the pit.An unwholesome smell of wet earth, a damp, subterranean coolness,
enveloped Rudolph as he slid down a flue of greasy clay, and stooping,
crawled into the horizontal bore of the tunnel.Large enough, perhaps,
for two or three men to pass on all fours, it ran level, roughly cut,
through earth wet with seepage from the river, but packed into a smooth
floor by many hands and bare knees.In
the small chamber of the mine, choked with the smell of stale betel, he
bumped Heywood's elbow."Some Fragrant Ones have been working here, I should say."The speaker
patted the ground with quick palms, groping.This explains old Wutz, and his broken arrow.I say, Rudie, feel
about.I saw a coil of fuse lying somewhere.--At least, I thought it
was."How's the old forearm I gave you?Equal to hauling a
sack out?Sweeping his hand in the darkness, he captured Rudolph's, and guided it
to where a powder-bag lay."Now, then, carry on," he commanded; and crawling into the tunnel,
flung back fragments of explanation as he tugged at his own load."Carry
these out--far as we dare--touch 'em off, you see, and block the
passage.We can use this hole afterward,
for listening in, if they try--"

He cut the sentence short.Their tunnel had begun to <DW72> gently
downward, with niches gouged here and there for the passing of
burden-bearers.Rudolph, toiling after, suddenly found his head
entangled between his leader's boots.An odd little squeak of
surprise followed, a strange gurgling, and a succession of rapid shocks,
as though some one were pummeling the earthen walls."Got the beggar," panted Heywood.Roll clear, Rudie,
and let us pass.Collar his legs, if you can, and shove."Squeezing past Rudolph in his niche, there struggled a convulsive bulk,
like some monstrous worm, too large for the bore, yet writhing.Bare
feet kicked him in violent rebellion, and a muscular knee jarred
squarely under his chin.He caught a pair of naked legs, and hugged
them dearly."Not too hard," called Heywood, with a breathless laugh."Poor
devil--must think he ran foul of a genie."Indeed, their prisoner had already given up the conflict, and lay under
them with limbs dissolved and quaking."Pass him along," chuckled his captor.Prodded into action, the man stirred limply, and crawled past them
toward the mine, while Heywood, at his heels, growled orders in the
vernacular with a voice of dismal ferocity.In this order they gained
the shaft, and wriggled up like ferrets into the night air.Rudolph,
standing as in a well, heard a volley of questions and a few timid
answers, before the returning legs of his comrade warned him to dodge
back into the tunnel.Again the two men crept forward on their expedition; and this time the
leader talked without lowering his voice."That chap," he declared, "was fairly chattering with fright.Coolie, it
seems, who came back to find his betel-box.The rest are all outside
eating their rice.They stumbled on their powder-sacks, caught hold, and dragged them, at
first easily down the incline, then over a short level, then arduously
up a rising grade, till the work grew heavy and hot, and breath came
hard in the stifled burrow."Far enough," said Heywood, puffing.Rudolph, however, was not only drenched with sweat, but fired by a new
spirit, a spirit of daring.He would try, down here in the bowels of the
earth, to emulate his friend."But let us reconnoitre," he objected."It will bring us to the clay-pit
where I saw them digging.Let us go out to the end, and look."By his tone, he was proud of the amendment.I say, I didn't really--I didn't _want_ poor old
Gilly down here, you know."They crawled on, with more speed but no less caution, up the strait
little gallery, which now rose between smooth, soft walls of clay.Suddenly, as the incline once more became a level, they saw a glimmering
square of dusky red, like the fluttering of a weak flame through scarlet
cloth.This, while they shuffled toward it, grew higher and broader,
until they lay prone in the very door of the hill,--a large, square-cut
portal, deeply overhung by the edge of the clay-pit, and flanked with
what seemed a bulkhead of sand-bags piled in orderly tiers.Between
shadowy mounds of loose earth flickered the light of a fire, small and
distant, round which wavered the inky silhouettes of men, and beyond
which dimly shone a yellow face or two, a yellow fist clutched full of
boiled rice like a snowball.Beyond these, in turn, gleamed other little
fires, where other coolies were squatting at their supper.Heywood's voice trembled with joyful excitement."Look,
these bags; not sand-bags at all!Wait a bit--oh, by Jove, wait a bit!"He scurried back into the hill like a great rat, returned as quickly and
swiftly, and with eager hands began to uncoil something on the clay
threshold."Do you know enough to time a fuse?""Neither do I.
Powder's bad, anyhow.Here, quick, lend me a
knife."He slashed open one of the lower sacks in the bulkhead by the
door, stuffed in some kind of twisted cord, and, edging away, sat for an
instant with his knife-blade gleaming in the ruddy twilight."How long,
Rudie, how long?""Too long, or too short, spoils
everything."Now lie across," he ordered, "and shield the tandstickor."With a
sudden fuff, the match blazed up to show his gray eyes bright and
dancing, his face glossy with sweat; below, on the golden clay, the
twisted, lumpy tail of the fuse, like the end of a dusty vine.Darkness
followed, quick and blinding.A rosy, fitful coal sputtered, darting out
short capillary lines and needles of fire.If it blows up, and caves the earth on
us--" Heywood ran on hands and knees, as if that were his natural way of
going.Rudolph scrambled after, now urged by an ecstasy of apprehension,
now clogged as by the weight of all the hill above them.If it should
fall now, he thought, or now; and thus measuring as he crawled, found
the tunnel endless.When at last, however, they gained the bottom of the shaft, and were
hoisted out among their coolies on the shelving mound, the evening
stillness lay above and about them, undisturbed.The fuse could never
have lasted all these minutes."Gone out," said Heywood, gloomily.He climbed the bamboo scaffold, and stood looking over the wall.Rudolph
perched beside him,--by the same anxious, futile instinct of curiosity,
for they could see nothing but the night and the burning stars.Underground again, Rudie, and try our first plan.""The Sword-Pen looks to set off his mine
to-morrow morning."He clutched the wall in time to save himself, as the bamboo frame leapt
underfoot.Outside, the crest of the <DW72> ran black against a single
burst of flame.The detonation came like the blow of a mallet on
the ribs.Heywood jumped to the ground, and in a
pelting shower of clods, exulted:--


"He looked again, and saw it was
The middle of next week!"He ran off, laughing, in the wide hush of astonishment.CHAPTER XX


THE HAKKA BOAT

"Pretty fair," Captain Kneebone said.This grudging praise--in which, moreover, Heywood tamely acquiesced--was
his only comment.On Rudolph it had singular effects: at first filling
him with resentment, and almost making him suspect the little captain of
jealousy; then amusing him, as chance words of no weight; but in the
unreal days that followed, recurring to convince him with all the force
of prompt and subtle fore-knowledge.It helped him to learn the cold,
salutary lesson, that one exploit does not make a victory.The springing of their countermine, he found, was no deliverance.It had
two plain results, and no more: the crest of the high field, without,
had changed its contour next morning as though a monster had bitten it;
and when the day had burnt itself out in sullen darkness, there burst on
all sides an attack of prolonged and furious exasperation.The fusillade
now came not only from the landward sides, but from a long flotilla of
boats in the river; and although these vanished at dawn, the fire never
slackened, either from above the field, or from a distant wall, newly
spotted with loopholes, beyond the ashes of the go-down.On the night
following, the boats crept closer, and suddenly both gates resounded
with the blows of battering-rams.By daylight, the nunnery walls were pitted as with small-pox; yet
the little company remained untouched, except for Teppich, whose shaven
head was trimmed still closer and redder by a bullet, and for Gilbert
Forrester, who showed--with the grave smile of a man when fates are
playful--two shots through his loose jacket.He was the only man to smile; for the others, parched by days and
sweltered by nights of battle, questioned each other with hollow eyes
and sleepy voices.One at a time, in patches of hot shade, they lay
tumbled for a moment of oblivion, their backs studded thickly with
obstinate flies like the driven heads of nails.As thickly, in the dust,
empty Mauser cartridges lay glistening."And I bought food," mourned the captain, chafing the untidy stubble on
his cheeks, and staring gloomily down at the worthless brass."I bought
chow, when all Saigong was full o' cartridges!"The sight of the spent ammunition at their feet gave them more trouble
than the swarming flies, or the heat, or the noises tearing and
splitting the heat.Even Heywood went about with a hang-dog air,
speaking few words, and those more and more surly.Once he laughed, when
at broad noonday a line of queer heads popped up from the earthwork on
the knoll, and stuck there, tilted at odd angles, as though peering
quizzically.Both his laugh, however, and his one stare of scrutiny were
filled with a savage contempt,--contempt not only for the stratagem, but
for himself, the situation, all things."Dummies--lay figures, to draw our fire.he added, wearily "we couldn't waste a shot at 'em now even if they
were real."They knew, without being told,
that they should fire no more until at close quarters in some
final rush."Only a few more rounds apiece," he continued."Our friends outside must
have run nearly as short, according to the coolie we took prisoner in
the tunnel.But they'll get more supplies, he says, in a day or two.What's worse, his Generalissimo Fang expects big reinforcement, any day,
from up country."Perhaps he's lying," said Captain Kneebone, drowsily."Wish he were," snapped Heywood."That case," grumbled the captain, "we'd better signal your Hakka boat,
and clear out."Again their hollow eyes questioned each other in discouragement.It was
plain that he had spoken their general thought; but they were all too
hot and sleepy to debate even a point of safety.Thus, in stupor or
doubt, they watched another afternoon burn low by invisible degrees,
like a great fire dying.Another breathless evening settled over all--at
first with a dusty, copper light, widespread, as though sky and land
were seen through smoked glass; another dusk, of deep, sad blue; and
when this had given place to night, another mysterious lull.Midnight drew on, and no further change had come.Prowlers, made bold by
the long silence in the nunnery, came and went under the very walls of
the compound.In the court, beside a candle, Ah Pat the compradore sat
with a bundle of halberds and a whetstone, sharpening edge after edge,
placidly, against the time when there should be no more cartridges.Heywood and Rudolph stood near the water gate, and argued with Gilbert
Forrester, who would not quit his post for either of them."But I'm not sleepy," he repeated, with perverse, irritating serenity.And that river full of their boats?--Go away."While they reasoned and wrangled, something scraped the edge of the
wall.They could barely detect a small, stealthy movement above them, as
if a man, climbing, had lifted his head over the top.Suddenly, beside
it, flared a surprising torch, rags burning greasily at the end of a
long bamboo.The smoky, dripping flame showed no man there, but only
another long bamboo, impaling what might be another ball of rags.The
two poles swayed, inclined toward each other; for one incredible instant
the ball, beside its glowing fellow, shone pale and took on human
features.Black shadows filled the eye-sockets, and gave to the face an
uncertain, cavernous look, as though it saw and pondered.How long the apparition stayed, the three men could not tell; for even
after it vanished, and the torch fell hissing in the river, they stood
below the wall, dumb and sick, knowing only that they had seen the head
of Wutzler.Heywood was the first to make a sound--a broken, hypnotic sound, without
emphasis or inflection, as though his lips were frozen, or the words
torn from him by ventriloquy."We must get the women--out of here."Afterward, when he was no longer with them, his two friends recalled
that he never spoke again that night, but came and went in a kind of
silent rage, ordering coolies by dumb-show, and carrying armful after
armful of supplies to the water gate.The word passed, or a listless, tacit understanding, that every one must
hold himself ready to go aboard so soon after daylight as the hostile
boats should leave the river."If," said Gilly to Rudolph, while they
stood thinking under the stars, "if his boat is still there, now that
he--after what we saw."At dawn they could see the ragged flotilla of sampans stealing up-river
on the early flood; but of the masts that huddled in vapors by the
farther bank, they had no certainty until sunrise, when the green rag
and the rice-measure appeared still dangling above the Hakka boat.Even then it was not certain--as Captain Kneebone sourly pointed
out--that her sailors would keep their agreement.And when he had piled,
on the river-steps, the dry wood for their signal fire, a new difficulty
rose.One of the wounded converts was up, and hobbling with a stick; but
the other would never be ferried down any stream known to man.He lay
dying, and the padre could not leave him.All the others waited, ready and anxious; but no one grumbled because
death, never punctual, now kept them waiting.The flutter of birds,
among the orange trees, gradually ceased; the sun came slanting over
the eastern wall; the gray floor of the compound turned white and
blurred through the dancing heat.A torrid westerly breeze came
fitfully, rose, died away, rose again, and made Captain Kneebone curse."Next we'll lose the ebb, too, be
'anged."Noon passed, and mid-afternoon, before the padre came out from the
courtyard, covering his white head with his ungainly helmet."We may go now," he said gravely, "in a few minutes."No more were needed, for the loose clods in the old shaft of their
counter-mine were quickly handled, and the necessary words soon uttered.Captain Kneebone had slipped out through the water gate, beforehand, and
lighted the fire on the steps.But not one of the burial party turned
his head, to watch the success or failure of their signal, so long as
the padre's resonant bass continued.When it ceased, however, they returned quickly through the little grove.The captain opened the great gate, and looked out eagerly, craning to
see through the smoke that poured into his face.The Hakka boat had, indeed, vanished from her moorings.On the bronze
current, nothing moved but three fishing-boats drifting down, with the
smoke, toward the marsh and the bend of the river, and a small junk that
toiled up against wind and tide, a cluster of naked sailors tugging and
shoving at her heavy sweep, which chafed its rigging of dry rope, and
gave out a high, complaining note like the cry of a sea-gull."She's gone," repeated Captain Kneebone.But the compradore, dragging his bundle of sharp halberds, poked an
inquisitive head out past the captain's, and peered on all sides through
the smoke, with comical thoroughness.He dodged back, grinning and
ducking amiably."Moh bettah look-see," he chuckled; "dat coolie come-back, he too muchee
waitee, b'long one piecee foolo-man."Whoever handled the Hakka boat was no fool, but by working
upstream on the opposite shore, crossing above, and dropping down with
the ebb, had craftily brought her along the shallow, so close beneath
the river-wall, that not till now did even the little captain spy her.The high prow, the mast, now bare, and her round midships roof, bright
golden-thatched with leaves of the edible bamboo, came moving quiet as
some enchanted boat in a calm.The fugitives by the gate still thought
themselves abandoned, when her beak, six feet in air, stole past them,
and her lean boatmen, prodding the river-bed with their poles, stopped
her as easily as a gondola.The yellow steersman grinned, straining at
the pivot of his gigantic paddle."Remember _you_ in my will, too!"And the grinning lowdah nodded, as though he understood.They had now only to pitch their supplies through the smoke, down on the
loose boards of her deck.Then--Rudolph and the captain kicking the
bonfire off the stairs--the whole company hurried down and safely over
her gunwale: first the two women, then the few huddling converts, the
white men next, the compradore still hugging his pole-axes, and last of
all, Heywood, still in strange apathy, with haggard face and downcast
eyes.He stumbled aboard as though drunk, his rifle askew under one arm,
and in the crook of the other, Flounce, the fox-terrier, dangling,
nervous and wide awake.He looked to neither right nor left, met nobody's eye.The rest of the
company crowded into the house amidships, and flung themselves down
wearily in the grateful dusk, where vivid paintings and mysteries of
rude carving writhed on the fir bulkheads.But Heywood, with his dog and
the captain and Rudolph, sat in the hot sun, staring down at the
ramshackle deck, through the gaps in which rose all the stinks of the
sweating hold.The boatmen climbed the high slant of the bow, planted their stout
bamboos against their shoulders, and came slowly down, head first, like
straining acrobats.As slowly, the boat began to glide past the stairs.Thus far, though the fire lay scattered in the mud, the smoke drifted
still before them and obscured their silent, headlong transaction.Now,
thinning as they dropped below the corner of the wall, it left them
naked to their enemies on the knoll.At the same instant, from the marsh
ahead, the sentinel in the round hat sprang up again, like an
instantaneous mushroom.He shouted, and waved to his fellows inland.They had no time, however, to leave the high ground; for the whole
chance of the adventure took a sudden and amazing turn.Heywood sprang out of his stupor, and stood pointing.The face of his friend, by torchlight above the
wall, had struck him dumb.Now that he spoke, his companions saw,
exposed in the field to the view of the nunnery, a white body lying on a
framework as on a bier.Near the foot stood a rough sort of windlass.Above, on the crest of the field, where a band of men had begun to
scramble at the sentinel's halloo, there sat on a white pony the
bright-robed figure of the tall fanatic, Fang the Sword-Pen.Heywood's hands opened and shut rapidly, like things out of
control."Oh, Wutz, how did they--Saint Somebody--the martyrdom--
Poussin's picture in the Vatican.--I can't stand this, you chaps!"He snatched blindly at his gun, caught instead one of the compradore's
halberds, and without pause or warning, jumped out into the shallow
water.He ran splashing toward the bank, turned, and seemed to waver,
staring with wild eyes at the strange Tudor weapon in his hand.Then
shaking it savagely,--

"This will do!"He wheeled again, staggered to his feet on dry ground, and ran swiftly
along the eastern wall, up the rising field, straight toward his mark.Of the men on the knoll, a few fired and missed, the others, neutrals to
their will, stood fixed in wonder.Four or five, as the runner neared,
sprang out to intercept, but flew apart like ninepins.The watchers in
the boat saw the halberd flash high in the late afternoon sun, the
frightened pony swerve, and his rider go down with the one sweep of that
Homeric blow.The last they saw of Heywood, he went leaping from sight over the
crest, that swarmed with figures racing and stumbling after.The unheeded sentinel in the marsh fled, losing his great hat, as the
boat drifted round the point into midstream.CHAPTER XXI


THE DRAGON'S SHADOW

The lowdah would have set his dirty sails without delay, for the fair
wind was already drooping; but at the first motion he found himself
deposed, and a usurper in command, at the big steering-paddle.Captain
Kneebone, his cheeks white and suddenly old beneath the untidy stubble
of his beard, had taken charge.In momentary danger of being cut off
downstream, or overtaken from above, he kept the boat waiting along the
oozy shore.Puckering his eyes, he watched now the land, and now the
river, silent, furtive, and keenly perplexed, his head on a swivel, as
though he steered by some nightmare chart, or expected some instant and
transforming sight.Not until the sun touched the western hills, and long shadows from the
bank stole out and turned the stream from bright copper to vague
iron-gray, did he give over his watch.He left the tiller, with a
hopeless fling of the arm."Do as ye please," he growled, and cast himself down on deck by the
thatched house."Go on.--I'll never see _him_ again.--The heat, and
all--By the head, he was--Go on.He sat looking straight before him, with dull eyes that never moved;
nor did he stir at the dry rustle and scrape of the matting sail, slowly
hoisted above him.The quaggy banks, now darkening, slid more rapidly
astern; while the steersman and his mates in the high bow invoked the
wind with alternate chant, plaintive, mysterious, and half musical:--


"Ay-ly-chy-ly
Ah-ha-aah!"To the listeners, huddled in silence, the familiar cry became a long,
monotonous accompaniment to sad thoughts.Through the rhythm, presently,
broke a sound of small-arms,--a few shots, quick but softened by
distance, from far inland.The captain stirred, listened, dropped his head, and sat like stone.To
Rudolph, near him, the brief disturbance called up another evening--his
first on this same river, when from the grassy brink, above, he had
first heard of his friend.Now, at the same place, and by the same
light, they had heard the last.It was intolerable: he turned his back
on the captain.Inside, in the gloom of the painted cabin, the padre's
wife began suddenly to cry.After a time, the deep voice of her husband,
speaking very low, and to her alone, became dimly audible:--

"'All this is come upon us; yet have we not--Our heart is not turned
back, neither have our steps declined--Though thou hast sore broken us
in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.'"The little captain groaned, and rolled aside from the doorway."All very fine," he muttered, his head wrapped in his arms."But that's
no good to me.Whether she heard him, or by chance, Miss Drake came quietly from
within, and found a place between him and the gunwale.He did not rouse;
she neither glanced nor spoke, but leaned against the ribs of
smooth-worn fir, as though calmly waiting.When at last he looked up, to see her face and posture, he gave an angry
start."And I thought," he blurted, "be 'anged if sometimes I didn't think you
liked him!"Her dark eyes met the captain's with a great and steadfast clearness."No," she whispered; "it was more than that."The captain sat bolt upright, but no longer in condemnation.For a long
time he watched her, marveling; and when finally he spoke, his sharp,
domineering voice was lowered, almost gentle.I never
meant--Don't ye mind a rough old beggar, that don't know that hasn't one
thing more between him and the grave.And that,
now--I wish't was at the bottom o' this bloomin' river!"They said no more, but rested side by side, like old friends joined
closer by new grief.Flounce, the terrier, snuffing disconsolately about
the deck, and scratching the boards in her zeal to explore the shallow
hold, at last grew weary, and came to snuggle down between the two
silent companions.Not till then did the girl turn aside her face, as
though studying the shore, which now melted in a soft, half-liquid band
as black as coal-tar, above the luminous indigo of the river.Suddenly Rudolph got upon his feet, and craning outboard from gunwale
and thatched eaves, looked steadily forward into the dusk.A chatter of
angry voices came stealing up, in the pauses of the wind.He watched and
listened, then quickly drew in his head.Two or three of the voices hailed together, raucously.The steersman,
leaning on the loom of his paddle, made neither stir nor answer.They
hailed again, this time close aboard, and as it seemed, in rage.Glancing contemptuously to starboard, the lowdah made some negligent
reply, about a cargo of human hair.His indifference appeared so real,
that for a moment Rudolph suspected him: perhaps he had been bought
over, and this meeting arranged.The
voices began to drop astern, and to come in louder confusion with
the breeze.But at this point Flounce, the terrier, spoiled all by whipping up
beside the lowdah, and furiously barking.Hers was no pariah's yelp: she
barked with spirit, in the King's English.For answer, there came a shout, a sharp report, and a bullet that ripped
through the matting sail.The steersman ducked, but clung bravely to his
paddle.Men tumbled out from the cabin, rifles in hand, to join Rudolph
and the captain.Astern, dangerously near, they saw the hostile craft, small, but listed
heavily with crowding ruffians, packed so close that their great wicker
hats hung along the gunwale to save room, and shone dim in the obscurity
like golden shields of vikings.A squat, burly fellow, shouting, jammed
the yulow hard to bring her about."Save your fire," called Captain Kneebone.As he spoke, however, an active form bounced up beside the squat man at
the sweep,--a plump, muscular little barefoot woman in blue.She tore
the fellow's hands away, and took command, keeping the boat's nose
pointed up-river, and squalling ferocious orders to all on board.This small, nimble, capable creature
could be no one but Mrs.Wu, their friend and gossip of that morning,
long ago....

The squat man gave an angry shout, and turned on her to wrest away the
handle.With great violence, yet with a
neat economy of motion, the Pretty Lily took one hand from her tiller,
long enough to topple him overboard with a sounding splash.Her passengers, at so prompt and visual a joke, burst into shrill,
cackling laughter.Yet more shrill, before their mood could alter, the
Pretty Lily scourged them with the tongue of a humorous woman.She held
her course, moreover; the two boats drifted so quickly apart that when
she turned, to fling a comic farewell after the white men, they could no
more than descry her face, alert and comely, and the whiteness of her
teeth.Her laughing cry still rang, the overthrown leader still
floundered in the water, when the picture blurred and vanished.Down the
wind came her words, high, voluble, quelling all further mutiny aboard
that craft of hers.The tall padre eyed Rudolph with sudden interest,
and laid his big hand on the young man's shoulder."No," answered Rudolph, and shook his head, sadly."We owe that to--some
one else."Later, while they drifted down to meet the sea and the night, he told
the story, to which all listened with profound attention, wondering at
the turns of fortune, and at this last service, rendered by a friend
they should see no more.They murmured awhile, by twos and threes huddled in corners; then lay
silent, exhausted in body and spirit.The river melted with the shore
into a common blackness, faintly hovered over by the hot, brown, sullen
evening.Unchallenged, the Hakka boat flitted past the lights of a
war-junk, so close that the curved lantern-ribs flickered thin and sharp
against a smoky gleam, and tawny faces wavered, thick of lip and stolid
of eye, round the supper fire.A greasy, bitter smell of cooking floated
after.Then no change or break in the darkness, except a dim lantern or
two creeping low in a sampan, with a fragment of talk from unseen
passers; until, as the stars multiplied overhead, the night of the land
rolled heavily astern and away from another, wider night, the stink of
the marshes failed, and by a blind sense of greater buoyancy and
sea-room, the voyagers knew that they had gained the roadstead.Ahead,
far off and lustrous, a new field of stars hung scarce higher than
their gunwale, above the rim of the world.The lowdah showed no light; and presently none was needed, for--as the
shallows gave place to deeps--the ocean boiled with the hoary,
green-gold magic of phosphorus, that heaved alongside in soft explosions
of witch-fire, and sent uncertain smoky tremors playing through the
darkness on deck.Rudolph, watching this tropic miracle, could make out
the white figure of the captain, asleep near by, under the faint
semicircle of the deck-house; and across from him, Miss Drake, still
sitting upright, as though waiting, with Flounce at her side.Landward,
against the last sage-green vapor of daylight, ran the dim range of the
hills, in long undulations broken by sharper crests, like the finny back
of leviathan basking.Over there, thought Rudolph, beyond that black shape as beyond its
guarding dragon, lay the whole mysterious and peaceful empire, with
uncounted lives going on, ending, beginning, as though he, and his sore
loss, and his heart vacant of all but grief, belonged to some
unheard-of, alien process, to Nature's most unworthy trifling.This
boatload of men and women--so huge a part of his own experience--was
like the tiniest barnacle chafed from the side of that dark,
serene monster.Rudolph stared long at the hills, and as they faded, hung his head.From that dragon he had learned much; yet now all learning was but loss.Of a sudden the girl spoke, in a clear yet guarded voice, too low to
reach the sleepers.It will be good for
both of us."Rudolph crossed silently, and stood leaning on the gunwale beside her."I thought only," he answered, "how much the hills looked so--as a
dragon."The trembling phosphorus half-revealed her face, pale and
still."I was thinking of that, in a way.It reminded me of what he
said, once--when we were walking together."To their great relief, they found themselves talking of Heywood, sadly,
but freely, and as it were in a sudden calm.Their friendship seemed,
for the moment, a thing as long established as the dragon hills.Years
afterward, Rudolph recalled her words, plainer than the fiery wonder
that spread and burst round their little vessel, or the long play of
heat-lightning which now, from time to time, wavered instantly along the
eastern sea-line."To go on with life, even when we
are alone--You will go on, I know.And again she said: "Yes,
such men as he are--a sort of Happy Warrior."And later, in her slow and
level voice: "You learned something, you say.Isn't that--what I
call--being invulnerable?When a man's greater than anything that
happens to him--"

So they talked, their speech bare and simple, but the pauses and longer
silences filled with deep understanding, solemnized by the time and the
place, as though their two lonely spirits caught wisdom from the night,
scope from the silent ocean, light from the flickering East.The flashes, meanwhile, came faster and prolonged their glory, running
behind a thin, dead screen of scalloped clouds, piercing the tropic sky
with summer blue, and ripping out the lost horizon like a long black
fibre from pulp.The two friends watched in silence, when Rudolph rose,
and moved cautiously aft.So long as the boiling witch-fire
turned their wake to golden vapor, he could not be sure; but whenever
the heat-lightning ran, and through the sere, phantasmal sail, the
lookout in the bow flashed like a sharp silhouette through wire
gauze,--then it seemed to Rudolph that another small black shape leapt
out astern, and vanished.He stood by the lowdah, watching anxiously.Time and again the ocean flickered into view, like the floor of a
measureless cavern; and still he could not tell.But at last the lowdah
also turned his head, and murmured.Their boat creaked monotonously,
drifting to leeward in a riot of golden mist; yet now another creaking
disturbed the night, in a different cadence.Another boat followed them,
rowing fast and gaining.In a brighter flash, her black sail fluttered,
unmistakable.Rudolph reached for his gun, but waited silently.Some chance fisherman, it might be, or any small craft holding the same
course along the coast.Still, he did not like the hurry of the sweeps,
which presently groaned louder and threw up nebulous fire.The
stranger's bow became an arrowhead of running gold.And here was Flounce, ready to misbehave once more.Before he could
catch her, the small white body of the terrier whipped by him, and past
the steersman.This time, however, as though cowed, she began to
whimper, and then maintained a long, trembling whine.Beside Rudolph, the compradore's head bobbed up.And in his native tongue, Ah Pat grumbled
something about ghosts.A harsh voice hailed, from the boat astern; the lowdah answered; and so
rapidly slid the deceptive glimmer of her bow, that before Rudolph knew
whether to wake his friends, or could recover, next, from the shock and
ecstasy of unbelief, a tall white figure jumped or swarmed over
the side.sounded the voice of Heywood, gravely.With fingers
that dripped gold, he tried to pat the bounding terrier.She flew up at
him, and tumbled back, in the liveliest danger of falling overboard.In a daze, Rudolph gripped the wet and shining hands,
and heard the same quiet voice: "Rest all asleep, I suppose?To-morrow will do.--Have you any money on you?Toss that
fisherman--whatever you think I'm worth.He really rowed like steam,
you know."Rudolph flung his purse into the other boat.When he turned, this man
restored from the sea had disappeared.But he had only stolen forward,
dog in arms, to sit beside Miss Drake.So quietly had all happened, that
none of the sleepers, not even the captain, was aware.Rudolph drew near
the two murmuring voices.

"--Couldn't help it, honestly," said Heywood."Can't describe, or
explain.Just something--went black inside my head, you know.""No: don't recall seeing a thing, really, until I pitched away
the--what happened to be in my hands.Losing your
head, I suppose they call it.The girl's question recalled him from his puzzle."I ran, that's all.--Oh,
yes, but I ran faster.--Not half so many as you'd suppose.Most of 'em
were away, burning your hospital.Hence those stuffed hats, Rudie, in the trench.--Only three
of the lot could run.I merely scuttled into the next bamboo, and kept
on scuttling.Oh, yes, arrow in the
shoulder--scratch.Of course, when it came dark, I stopped running, and
made for the nearest fisherman."But," protested Rudolph, wondering, "we heard shots.""Yes, I had my Webley in my belt.I _told_ you: three of
them could run."The speaker patted the terrier in his lap."My dream,
eh, little dog?You _were_ the only one to know.""No," said the girl: "I knew--all the time, that--"

Whatever she meant, Rudolph could only guess; but it was true, he
thought, that she had never once spoken as though the present meeting
were not possible, here or somewhere.Recalling this, he suddenly but
quietly stepped away aft, to sit beside the steersman, and smile in
the darkness.He did not listen, but watched the phosphorus
welling soft and turbulent in the wake, and far off, in glimpses of the
tropic light, the great Dragon weltering on the face of the waters.The
shape glimmered forth, died away, like a prodigy."Ich lieg' und besitze."And yet," thought the young man, "I have one pearl from his hoard."That girl was right: like Siegfried tempered in the grisly flood, the
raw boy was turning into a man, seasoned and invulnerable.Heywood was calling to him:--

"You must go Home with us.I've made a wonderful plan--with
the captain's fortune!A small white heap across the deck began to rise."How often," complained a voice blurred with sleep, "how often must I
tell ye--wake me, unless the ship--chart's all--Good God!"At the captain's cry, those who lay in darkness under the thatched roof
began to mutter, to rise, and grope out into the trembling light, with
sleepy cries of joy.I now found myself in the midst of a large
and select assortment of clerks, whose tongues were hard at work if
their pens were not, and who did not seem half so much astonished at
seeing me there as I felt at finding myself.The room itself looked
like an hypertrophied law office, of which the principal features were
papers and presses, three-legged stools, calf-bound folios, and cobwebs.I stood for a considerable time, observing but unobserved, wondering
all the while what to say, how to say it, and whom to say it to, and
resisting an inclination to put my finger in my mouth.Moreover, at
that moment a war was going on within me between pride and modesty, for
I was not at all certain whether I ought to take off my hat; so being
"canny" and a Scot, I adopted a middle course, and commenced to wipe
imaginary perspiration from my brow, an operation which, of course,
necessitated the removal of my head-dress.Probably the cambric
handkerchief caught the tail of the eye of a quieter-looking knight of
the quill, who sat a little apart from the other drones of the pen; at
any rate he quickly dismounted, and coming up to me politely asked my
business.I told him, and he civilly motioned me to a seat to await my
turn for examination.By-and-bye other candidates dropped in, each of
whom I rejoiced to observe looked a little paler, decidedly more blue,
and infinitely greener than I did myself!This was some relief, so I
sat by the dusty window which overlooked the Thames, watching the little
skiffs gliding to and fro, the boats hastening hither and thither, and
the big lazy-like barges that floated on the calm unruffled bosom of the
great mysterious river, and thinking and wishing that it could but break
its everlasting silence and tell its tale, and mention even a tithe of
the scenes that had been acted on its breast or by its banks since it
first rolled its infant waters to the sea, through a forest of trees
instead of a forest of masts and spires, or tell of the many beings that
had sought relief from a world of sin and suffering under its dark
current.So ran my thoughts, and as the river so did time glide by, and
two hours passed away, then a third; and when at last my name was
called, it was only to inform me that I must come back on the following
day, there being too many to be examined at once.At the hour appointed I was immediately conducted into the presence of
the august assembly of examiners, and this, is what I saw, or rather,
this was the picture on my retina, for to see, in the usual acceptation
of the term, was, under the circumstances, out of the question:--A table
with a green cover, laid out for a feast--to me a ghastly feast--of
reason and flow of soul.My reason was to form the feast, my soul was
to flow; the five pleasant-looking and gentlemanly men who sat around
were to partake of the banquet.I did not walk into the room, I seemed
to glide as if in a dream, or as if I had been my own ghost.Every
person and every thing in the room appeared strangely contorted; and the
whole formed a wonderful mirage, miraculously confused.The fire hopped
up on the table, the table consigned itself to the flames at one moment,
and made an insane attempt to get up the chimney the next.The roof
bending down in one corner affectionately kissed the carpet, the carpet
bobbing up at another returned the chaste salute.Then the gentlemen
smiled on me pleasantly, while I replied by a horrible grin."Sit down, sir," said one, and his voice sounded far away, as if in
another world, as I tottered to the chair, and with palsied arm helped
myself to a glass of water, which had been placed on the table for my
use.The water revived me, and at the first task I was asked to
perform--translate a small portion of Gregory's (not powder) Conspectus
into English--my senses came back.The scales fell from my eyes, the
table and fire resumed their proper places, the roof and carpet ceased
to dally, my scattered brains came all of a heap once more, and I was
myself again as much as ever Richard was, or any other man.I answered
most of the questions, if not all.I was tackled for ten minutes at a
time by each of the examiners.I performed mental operations on the
limbs of beings who never existed, prescribed hypothetically for
innumerable ailments, brought divers mythical children into the world,
dissected muscles and nerves in imagination, talked of green trees,
fruit, flowers, natural families, and far-away lands, as if I had been
Linnaeus, Columbus, and Humboldt all in one, so that, in less than an
hour, the august body leant their backs against their respective chairs,
and looked knowingly in each other's faces for a period of several very
long seconds.They then nodded to one another, did this august body,
looked at their tablets, and nodded again.After this pantomime had
come to a conclusion I was furnished with a sheet of foolscap and sent
back to the room above the Thames to write a dissertation on fractures
of the cranium, and shortly after sending it in I was recalled and
informed that I had sustained the dread ordeal to their entire
satisfaction, etc, and that I had better, before I left the house, pay
an official visit to the Director-General.I bowed, retired, heaved a
monster sigh, made the visit of ceremony, and afterwards my exit.I met on coming out was a short, middle-aged
Shylock, hook-nosed and raven-haired, and arrayed in a surtout of seedy
black.He approached me with much bowing and smiling, and holding below
my nose a little green tract which he begged I would accept."Exceedingly kind," thought I, and was about to comply with his request,
when, greatly to my surprise and the discomposure of my toilet, an arm
was hooked into mine, I was wheeled round as if on a pivot, and found
myself face to face with another Israelite armed with a _red_ tract."He is a Jew and a dog," said this latter, shaking a forefinger close to
my face.said I.  The words had hardly escaped my lips when the other
Jew whipped his arm through mine and quickly re-wheeled me towards him."He is a liar and a cheat," hissed he, with the same motion of the
forefinger as his rival had used.said I, beginning to wonder what it all meant.I had not,
however, long time to wonder, being once more set spinning by the
Israelite of the red tract.he whispered, pointing to the other; and the
conversation was continued in the following strain.Although in the
common sense of the word it really was no conversation, as each of them
addressed himself to me only, and I could find no reply, still, taking
the word in its literal meaning (from con, together, and _verto_, I
turn), it was indeed a conversation, for they turned me together, each
one, as he addressed me, hooking his arm in mine and whirling me round
like the handle of an air-pump or a badly constructed teetotum, and
shaking a forefinger in my face, as if I were a parrot and he wanted me
to swear._Shylock of the green tract_.--"He is a swine and a scoundrel."_Israelite of the red_.--"He's a liar and a thief."_Shylock of the green_.--"And he'll get round you some way."_Israelite of red_.--"Ahab and brothers cheat everybody they can."_Shylock of green_.--"He'll be lending you money."_Red_.--"Whole town know them--"

_Green_.--"Charge you thirty per cent."Red--"They are swindlers and dogs."_Green_.--"Look at our estimate."_Red_.--"Look at _our_ estimate."_Green_.--"Peep at our charges."_Red_.--"Five years' credit."_Green_.--"Come with us, sir," tugging me to the right._Red_.--"This way, master," pulling me to the left._Green_.--"Be advised; he'll rob you."_Red_.--"If you go he'll murder you."I roared; and letting fly both fists at the same time,
I turned them both together on their backs and thus put an end to the
conversation.Only just in time, though, for the remaining ten tribes,
or their representatives, were hurrying towards me, each one swaying
aloft a gaudy- tract; and I saw no way of escaping but by fairly
making a run for it, which I accordingly did, pursued by the ten tribes;
and even had I been a centipede, I would have assuredly been torn limb
from limb, had I not just then rushed into the arms of my feline friend
from Bond Street.He purred, gave me a paw and many congratulations; was so glad I had
passed,--but, to be sure, knew I would,--and so happy I had escaped the
Jews; would I take a glass of beer?I said, "I didn't mind;" so we adjourned (the right word in the right
place--adjourned) to a quiet adjoining hotel."Now," said he, as he tendered the waiter a five-pound Bank of England
note, "you must not take it amiss, Doctor, but--"

"No smaller change, sir?""I'm afraid," said my friend (?), opening and turning over the contents
of a well-lined pocket-book, "I've only got five--oh, here are sovs, he!Then turning to me: "I was going to observe," he continued, "that
if you want a pound or two, he!he!--you know young fellows will be
young fellows--only don't say a word to my father, he!Well, we will go and see
father!""But," said I, "I really must go home first.""Oh dear no; don't think of such a thing.""I'm deuced hungry," continued I."My dear sir, excuse me, but it is just our dinner hour; nice roast
turkey, and boiled leg of mutton with--"

"Any pickled pork?"now you young _officers_ will have your jokes; but, he!though we don't just eat pork, you'll find us just as good as most
Christians.Some capital wine--very old brand; father got it from the
Cape only the other day; in fact, though I should not mention these
things, it was sent us by a grateful customer.But come, you're hungry,
we'll get a cab."FIND OUT WHAT A "GIG"
MEANS.The fortnight immediately subsequent to my passing into the Royal Navy
was spent by me in the great metropolis, in a perfect maze of pleasure
and excitement.For the first time for years I knew what it was to be
free from care and trouble, independent, and quietly happy.I went the
round of the sights and the round of the theatres, and lingered
entranced in the opera; but I went all alone, and unaccompanied, save by
a small pocket guide-book, and I believe I enjoyed it all the more on
that account.No one cared for nor looked at the lonely stranger, and
he at no one.I roamed through the spacious streets, strolled
delightedly in the handsome parks, lounged in picture galleries, or
buried myself for hour's in the solemn halls and classical courts of
that prince of public buildings the British Museum; and, when tired of
rambling, I dined by myself in a quiet hotel.Every sight was strange
to me, every sound was new; it was as if some good fairy, by a touch of
her magic wand, had transported me to an enchanted city; and when I
closed my eyes at night, or even shut them by day, behold, there was the
same moving panorama that I might gaze on till tired or asleep.But all this was too good to last long.One morning, on coming down to
breakfast, bright-hearted and beaming as ever, I found on my plate,
instead of fried soles, a long blue official letter, "On her Majesty's
Service."It was my appointment to the `Victory,'--"additional for
service at Haslar Hospital."As soon as I read it the enchantment was
dissolved, the spell was broken; and when I tried that day to find new
pleasures, new sources of amusement, I utterly failed, and found with
disgust that it was but a common work-a-day world after all, and that
London was very like other places in that respect.I lingered but a few
more days in town, and then hastened by train to Portsmouth to take up
my appointment--to join the service in reality.It was a cold raw morning, with a grey and cheerless sky, and a biting
south-wester blowing up channel, and ruffling the water in the Solent.Alongside of the pier the boats and wherries were all in motion,
scratching and otherwise damaging their gunwales against the stones, as
they were lifted up and down at the pleasure of the wavelets.The
boatmen themselves were either drinking beer at adjacent bars, or
stamping up and down the quay with the hopes of enticing a little warmth
to their half-frozen toes, and rubbing the ends of their noses for a
like purpose.Suddenly there arose a great commotion among them, and
they all rushed off to surround a gentleman in brand-new naval uniform,
who was looking, with his mouth open, for a boat, in every place where a
boat was most unlikely to be.Knowing at a glance that he was a
stranger, they very generously, each and all of them, offered their
services, and wanted to row him somewhere--anywhere.After a great deal
of fighting and scrambling among themselves, during which the officer
got tugged here and tugged there a good many times, he was at last
bundled into a very dirty cobble, into which a rough-looking boatman
bounded after him and at once shoved off.The naval officer was myself--the reader's obsequious slave.As for the
boatman, one thing must be said in his favour, he seemed to be a person
of religious character--in one thing at least, for, on the Day of
Judgment, I, for one, will not be able to turn round and say to him "I
was a stranger and ye took me not in," for he did take me in.In fact,
Portsmouth, as a town, is rather particular on this point of
Christianity: they do take strangers in.asked the jolly waterman, leaning a moment on his oars."Be going for to join, I dessay, sir?""You are right," said I; "but have the goodness to pull so that I may
not be wet through on both sides.""I'll pay here," said I, "before we go alongside.""That's all, sir--distance is short you know.""Do you mean to say," said I, "that you really mean to charge--"

"Just three bob," interrupting me; "flag's up--can see for yourself,
sir.""The flag, you see--I mean my good man--don't tell me about a flag, I'm
too far north for you;" and I tried to look as northish as possible."Why, sir," said the man of oars, with a pitying expression of
countenance and voice, "flag means double fare--anybody'll tell you
that, sir."said I; "don't tell me that any one takes the trouble of
hoisting a flag in order to fill your confounded pockets; there is half
a crown, and not a penny more do you get from me.""Well, sir, o' condition you has me again, sir, you know, sir,--and my
name's McDonald;" and he pocketed the money, which I afterwards
discovered was a _leetle_ too much."McDonald," thought I--"my
grandmother's name; the rascal thinks to come round me by calling
himself a Scotchman--the idea of a McDonald being a waterman!""Sir," said I, aloud, "it is my unbiassed opinion and firm conviction
that you are--" I was going to add "a most unmitigated blackguard," but
I noticed that he was a man of six feet two, with breadth in proportion,
so I left the sentence unfinished.We were now within sight of the bristling sides of the old `Victory,' on
the quarter-deck of which fell the great and gallant Nelson in the hour
of battle and triumph; and I was a young officer about to join that
service which can boast of so many brave and noble men, and brave and
noble deeds; and one would naturally expect that I would indulge in a
few dreams of chivalry and romance, picture to myself a bright and
glorious future, pounds' weight of medals and crosses, including the
Victoria, kiss the hilt of my sword, and all that sort of thing.I was too wretchedly cold for one reason, and the only feeling I
had was one of shyness; as for duty, I knew I could and would do that,
as most of my countrymen had done before me; so I left castle-building
to the younger sons of noblemen or gentry, whose parents can afford to
allow them two or three hundred pounds a year to eke out their pay and
smooth the difficulties of the service.Not having been fortunate
enough to be born with even a horn spoon in my mouth, I had to be
content with my education as my fortune, and my navy pay as my only
income."Stabird side, I dessay, sir?""Certainly," said I, having a glimmering idea that it must be the proper
side.A few minutes after--"The Admiral's gig is going there, sir,--better
wait a bit."I looked on shore and _did_ see a gig, and two horses
attached to it."No," said I, "decidedly not, he can't see us here, man.I suppose you
want to go sticking your dirty wet oars in the air, do you?"--(I had
seen pictures of this performance)."Drive on, I mean pull ahead, my
hearty"--a phrase I had heard at the theatre, and considered highly
nautical.The waterman obeyed, and here is what came of it.We were just
approaching the ladder, when I suddenly became sensible of a rushing
noise.I have a dim recollection of seeing a long, many-oared boat,
carrying a large red flag, and with an old grey-haired officer sitting
astern; of hearing a voice--it might have belonged to the old man of the
sea, for anything I could have told to the contrary--float down the
wind,--

"Clear the way with that (something) bumboat!"Then came a crash, my
heels flew up--I had been sitting on the gunwale--and overboard I went
with a splash, just as some one else in the long boat sang out.there was a little too much way for me.When I came
to the surface of the water, I found myself several yards from the
ladder, and at once struck out for it.There was a great deal of noise
and shouting, and a sailor held towards me the sharp end of a boathook;
but I had no intention of being lugged out as if I were a pair of canvas
trowsers, and, calling to the sailor to keep his pole to himself--did he
want to knock my eye out?--I swam to the ladder and ascended.Thus then
I joined the service, and, having entered at the foot of the ladder, I
trust some day to find myself at the top of it.And, talking of joining the service, I here beg to repudiate, as an
utter fabrication, the anecdote--generally received as authentic in the
service--of the Scotch doctor, who, going to report himself for the
first time on board of the `Victory,' knocked at the door, and inquired
(at a marine, I think), "Is this the Royal Nauvy?--'cause I'm come till
jine."The story bears "fib" on the face of it, for there is not a
Scottish schoolboy but knows that one ship does not make a navy, any
more than one swallow does a summer.But, dear intending candidate, if you wish to do the right thing, array
yourself quietly in frock-coat, cap--not cocked hat, remember--and
sword, and go on board your ship in any boat you please, only keep out
of the way of gigs.When you arrive on board, don't be expecting to see
the admiral, because you'll be disappointed; but ask a sailor or marine
to point you out the midshipman of the watch, and request the latter to
show you the commander.Make this request civilly, mind you; do not
pull his ear, because, if big and hirsute, he might beat you, which
would be a bad beginning.When you meet the commander, don't rush up
and shake him by the hand, and begin talking about the weather; walk
respectfully up to him, and lift your cap as you would to a lady; upon
which he will hurriedly point to his nose with his forefinger, by way of
returning the salute, while at the same time you say--

"_Come_ on board, sir--to _join_, sir."It is the custom of the Service to make this remark in a firm, bold,
decided tone, placing the emphasis on the "_come_" to show clearly that
you _did come_, and that no one kicked, or dragged, or otherwise brought
you on board against your will.The proper intonation of the remark may
be learned from any polite waiter at a hotel, when he tells you,
"Dinner's ready, sir, please;" or it may be heard in the "Now then,
gents," of the railway guard of the period.Having reported yourself to the man of three stripes, you must not
expect that he will shake hands, or embrace you, ask you on shore to
tea, and introduce you to his wife.No, if he is good-natured, and has
not had a difference of opinion with the captain lately, he _may_
condescend to show you your cabin and introduce you to your messmates;
but if he is out of temper, he will merely ask your name, and, on your
telling him, remark, "Humph!"then call the most minute midshipman to
conduct you to your cabin, being at the same time almost certain to
mispronounce your name.Say your name is Struthers, he will call you
Stutters."Here, Mr Pigmy, conduct Mr Stutters to his cabin, and show him where
the gunroom--ah!I beg his pardon, the wardroom--lies.""Ay, ay, sir," says the middy, and skips off at a round trot, obliging
you either to adopt the same ungraceful mode of progression, or lose
sight of him altogether, and have to wander about, feeling very much
from home, until some officer passing takes pity on you and leads you to
the wardroom.It is a way they have in the service, or rather it is the custom of the
present Director-General, not to appoint the newly-entered medical
officer at once to a sea-going ship, but instead to one or other of the
naval hospitals for a few weeks or even months, in order that he may be
put up to the ropes, as the saying is, or duly initiated into the
mysteries of service and routine of duty.This is certainly a good
idea, although it is a question whether it would not be better to adopt
the plan they have at Netley, and thus put the navy and army on the same
footing.Haslar Hospital at Portsmouth is a great rambling barrack-looking block
of brick building, with a yard or square surrounded by high walls in
front, and with two wings extending from behind, which, with the chapel
between, form another and smaller square.There are seldom fewer than a thousand patients within, and, independent
of a whole regiment of male and female nurses, sick-bay-men, servants,
cooks, _et id genus omne_, there is a regular staff of officers,
consisting of a captain--of what use I have yet to learn--two medical
inspector-generals, generally three or four surgeons, the same number of
regularly appointed assistant-surgeons, besides from ten to twenty
acting assistant-surgeons [Note 1] waiting for appointments, and doing
duty as supernumeraries.Of this last class I myself was a member.Soon as the clock tolled the hour of eight in the morning, the
staff-surgeon of our side of the hospital stalked into the duty cabin,
where we, the assistants, were waiting to receive him.Immediately
after, we set out on the morning visit, each of us armed with a little
board or palette to be used as a writing-desk, an excise inkstand slung
in a buttonhole, and a quill behind the ear.The large doors were
thrown open, the beds neat and tidy, and the nurses "standing by."Up
each side of the long wards, from bed to bed, we journeyed; notifying
the progress of each case, repeating the treatment here, altering or
suspending it there, and performing small operations in another place;
listening attentively to tales of aches and pains, and hopes and fears,
and just in a sort of general way acting the part of good Samaritans.From one ward to another we went, up and down long staircases, along
lengthy corridors, into wards in the attics, into wards on the basement,
and into wards below ground,--fracture wards, Lazarus wards, erysipelas
wards, men's wards, officers' wards; and thus we spent the time till a
little past nine, by which time the relief of so much suffering had
given us an appetite, and we hurried off to the messroom to breakfast.The medical mess at Haslar is one of the finest in the service.Attached to the room is a nice little apartment, fitted up with a
bagatelle-table, and boxing gloves and foils _ad libitum_.And, sure
enough, you might walk many a weary mile, or sail many a knot, without
meeting twenty such happy faces as every evening surrounded our
dinner-table, without beholding twenty such bumper glasses raised at
once to the toast of Her Majesty the Queen, and without hearing twenty
such good songs, or five times twenty such yarns and original bons-mots,
as you would at Haslar Medical Mess.Yet I must confess we partook in
but a small degree indeed of the solemn quietude of Wordsworth's--

  "--Party in a parlour cramm'd,
  Some sipping punch, some sipping tea,
  But, as you by their faces see,
  All silent--and all damned."I do not deny that we were a little noisy at times, and that on several
occasions, having eaten and drunken till we were filled, we rose up to
dance, and consequently received a _polite_ message from the inspector
whose house was adjoining, requesting us to "stop our _confounded_ row;"
but then the old man was married, and no doubt his wife was at the
bottom of it.Duty was a thing that did not fall to the lot of us supers every day.We took it turn about, and hard enough work it used to be too.As soon
as breakfast was over, the medical officer on duty would hie him away to
the receiving-room, and seat himself at the large desk; and by-and-bye
the cases would begin to pour in.First there would arrive, say three
or four blue-jackets, with their bags under their arms, in charge of an
assistant-surgeon, then a squad of marines, then more blue-jackets, then
more red-coats, and so the game of _rouge-et-noir_ would go on during
the day.The officer on duty has first to judge whether or not the case
is one that can be admitted,--that is, which cannot be conveniently
treated on board; he has then to appoint the patient a bed in a proper
ward, and prescribe for him, almost invariably a bath and a couple of
pills.Besides, he has to enter the previous history of the case,
verbatim, into each patient's case-book, and if the cases are numerous,
and the assistant-surgeon who brings them has written an elaborate
account of each disease, the duty-officer will have had his work cut out
for him till dinner-time at least.Before the hour of the patient's
dinner, this gentleman has also to glance into each ward, to see if
everything is right, and if there are any complaints.Even when ten or
eleven o'clock at night brings sleep and repose to others, his work is
not yet over; he has one other visit to pay any time during the night
through all his wards.Then with dark-lantern and slippers you may meet
him, gliding ghost-like along the corridors or passages, lingering at
ward doors, listening on the staircases, smelling and snuffing, peeping
and keeking, and endeavouring by eye, or ear, or nose, to detect the
slightest irregularity among the patients or nurses, such as burning
lights without orders, gambling by the light of the fire, or smoking.This visit paid, he may return to his virtuous cabin, and sleep as
soundly as he chooses.Very few of the old surgeons interfere with the duties of their
assistants, but there _be_ men who seem to think you have merely come to
the service to learn, not to practise your profession, and therefore
they treat you as mere students, or at the best hobble-de-hoy doctors.Of this class was Dr Gruff, a man whom I would back against the whole
profession for caudle, clyster, castor-oil, or linseed poultice; but
who, I rather suspect, never prescribed a dose of chiretta, santonin, or
lithia-water in his life.He came to me one duty-day, in a great hurry,
and so much excited that I judged he had received some grievous bodily
ailment, or suffered some severe family bereavement."Well, sir," he cried; "I hear, sir, you have put a case of ulcer into
the erysipelas ward."This remark, not partaking of the nature of question, I thought required
no answer."Is it true, sir?--is it true?""It is, sir," was the reply."And what do you mean by it, sir?he
exclaimed, waxing more and more wroth."I thought, sir--" I began."Yes, sir," continued I, my Highland blood getting uppermost, "I _did_
think that, the case being one of ulcer of an _erysipelatous_ nature, I
was--"

"Erysipelatous ulcer!"said he, "that alters the
case.I beg your pardon;" and he
trotted off again."All right," thought I, "old Gruff.But although there are not wanting medical officers in the service who,
on being promoted to staff-surgeon, appear to forget that ever they wore
less than three stripes, and can keep company with no one under the rank
of commander, I am happy to say they are few and far between, and every
year getting more few and farther between.It is a fine thing to be appointed for, say three or four years to a
home hospital; in fact, it is the assistant-surgeon's highest ambition.Next, in point of comfort, would be an appointment at the Naval Hospital
of Malta, Cape of Good Hope, or China.The acting assistant-surgeons are those who have not as yet
served the probationary year, or been confirmed.They are liable to be
dismissed without a court-martial.A STORM IN BISCAY BAY.A WORD ON BASS'S BEER.For the space of six weeks I lived in clover at Haslar, and at the end
of that time my appointment to a sea-going ship came.It was the
pleasure of their Lordships the Commissioners, that I should take my
passage to the Cape of Good Hope in a frigate, which had lately been put
in commission and was soon about to sail.Arrived there, I was to be
handed over to the flag-ship on that station for disposal, like so many
stones of salt pork.On first entering the service every medical
officer is sent for one commission (three to five years) to a foreign
station; and it is certainly very proper too that the youngest and
strongest men, rather than the oldest, should do the rough work of the
service, and go to the most unhealthy stations.The frigate in which I was ordered passage was to sail from Plymouth.To that town I was accordingly sent by train, and found the good ship in
such a state of internal chaos--painters, carpenters, sail-makers, and
sailors; armourers, blacksmiths, gunners, and tailors; every one engaged
at his own trade, with such an utter disregard of order or regularity,
while the decks were in such confusion, littered with tools, nails,
shavings, ropes, and spars, among which I scrambled, and over which I
tumbled, getting into everybody's way, and finding so little rest for
the sole of my foot, that I was fain to beg a week's leave, and glad
when I obtained it.On going on board again at the end of that time, a
very different appearance presented itself; everything was in its proper
place, order and regularity were everywhere.The decks were white and
clean, the binnacles, the brass and mahogany work polished, the gear all
taut, the ropes coiled, and the vessel herself sitting on the water
saucy as the queen of ducks, with her pennant flying and her beautiful
ensign floating gracefully astern.The gallant ship was ready for sea,
had been unmoored, had made her trial trips, and was now anchored in the
Sound.From early morning to busy noon, and from noon till night, boats
glided backwards and forwards between the ship and the shore, filled
with the friends of those on board, or laden with wardroom and gunroom
stores.Among these might have been seen a shore-boat, rowed by two
sturdy watermen, and having on board a large sea-chest, with a naval
officer on top of it, grasping firmly a Cremona in one hand and holding
a hat-box in the other.The boat was filled with any number of smaller
packages, among which were two black portmanteaus, warranted to be the
best of leather, and containing the gentleman's dress and undress
uniforms; these, however, turned out to be mere painted pasteboard, and
in a very few months the cockroaches--careless, merry-hearted
creatures--after eating up every morsel of them, turned their attention
to the contents, on which they dined and supped for many days, till the
officer's dress-coat was like a meal-sieve, and his pantaloons might
have been conveniently need for a landing-net.This, however, was a
matter of small consequence, for, contrary to the reiterated assurance
of his feline friend, no one portion of this officer's uniform held out
for a longer period than six months, the introduction of any part of his
person into the corresponding portion of his raiment having become a
matter of matutinal anxiety and distress, lest a solution of continuity
in the garment might be the unfortunate result.About six o'clock on a beautiful Wednesday evening, early in the month
of May, our gallant and saucy frigate turned her bows seaward and slowly
steamed away from amidst the fleet of little boats that--crowded with
the unhappy wives and sweethearts of the sailors--had hung around us all
the afternoon.Puffing and blowing a great deal, and apparently panting
to be out and away at sea, the good ship nevertheless left her anchorage
but slowly, and withal reluctantly, her tears falling thick and fast on
the quarter-deck as she went.The band was playing a slow and mournful air, by way of keeping up our
spirits._I_ had no friends to say farewell to, there was no tear-bedimmed eye to
gaze after me until I faded in distance; so I stood on the poop, leaning
over the bulwarks, after the fashion of Vanderdecken, captain of the
Flying Dutchman, and equally sad and sorrowful-looking.And what did I
see from my elevated situation?A moving picture, a living panorama; a
bright sky sprinkled with a few fleecy cloudlets, over a blue sea all in
motion before a fresh breeze of wind; a fleet of little boats astern,
filled with picturesquely dressed seamen and women waving handkerchiefs;
the long breakwater lined with a dense crowd of sorrowing friends, each
anxious to gain one last look of the dear face he may never see more.Yonder is the grey-haired father, yonder the widowed mother, the
affectionate brother, the loving sister, the fond wife, the beloved
sweetheart,--all are there; and not a sigh that is sighed, not a tear
that is shed, not a prayer that is breathed, but finds a response in the
bosom of some loved one on board.To the right are green hills,
people-clad likewise, while away in the distance the steeple of many a
church "points the way to happier spheres," and on the flagstaff at the
port-admiral's house is floating the signal "Fare thee well."The band has ceased to play, the sailors have given their last ringing
cheer, even the echoes of which have died away, and faintly down the
wind comes the sound of the evening bells.The men are gathered in
little groups on deck, and there is a tenderness in their landward gaze,
and a pathos in their rough voices, that one would hardly expect to
find."Yonder's my Poll, Jack," says one.the poor lass is
crying; blowed if I think I'll ever see her more.""There," says another, "is _my_ old girl on the breakwater, beside the
old cove in the red nightcap.""That's my father, Bill," answers a third."God bless the dear old
chap?""Good-bye, Jean; good-bye, lass.Blessed if I
don't feel as if I could make a big baby of myself and cry outright."Dick, Dick," exclaims an honest-looking tar; "I see'd my poor wife
tumble down; she had wee Johnnie in her arms, and--and what will I do?""Keep up your heart, to be sure," answers a tall, rough son of a gun."There, she has righted again, only a bit of a swoon ye see.I've got
neither sister, wife, nor mother, so surely it's _me_ that ought to be
making a noodle of myself; but where's the use?"An hour or two later we were steaming across channel, with nothing
visible but the blue sea all before us, and the chalky cliffs of
Cornwall far behind, with the rosy blush of the setting sun lingering on
their summits.Then the light faded from the sky, the gloaming star shone out in the
east, big waves began to tumble in, and the night breeze blew cold and
chill from off the broad Atlantic Ocean.Tired and dull, weary and sad, I went below to the wardroom and seated
myself on a rocking chair.It was now that I began to feel the
discomfort of not having a cabin.Being merely a supernumerary or
passenger, such a luxury was of course out of the question, even had I
been an admiral.I was to have a screen berth, or what a landsman would
call a canvas tent, on the main or fighting deck, but as yet it was not
rigged.Had I never been to sea before, I would have now felt very
wretched indeed; but having roughed it in Greenland and Davis Straits in
small whaling brigs, I had got over the weakness of sea-sickness; yet
notwithstanding I felt all the thorough prostration both of mind and
body, which the first twenty-four hours at sea often produces in the
oldest and best of sailors, so that I was only too happy when I at last
found myself within canvas.By next morning the wind had freshened, and when I turned out I found
that the steam had been turned off, and that we were bowling along
before a ten-knot breeze.All that day the wind blew strongly from the
N.N.E., and increased as night came on to a regular gale of wind.I had
seen some wild weather in the Greenland Ocean, but never anything
before, nor since, to equal the violence of the storm on that dreadful
night, in the Bay of Biscay.We were running dead before the wind at
twelve o'clock, when the gale was at its worst, and when the order to
light fires and get up steam had been given.Just then we were making
fourteen knots, with only a foresail, a fore-topsail, and main-topsail,
the latter two close-reefed.I was awakened by a terrific noise on
deck, and I shall not soon forget that awakening.The ship was leaking
badly both at the ports and scupper-holes; so that the maindeck all
around was flooded with water, which lifted my big chest every time the
roll of the vessel allowed it to flow towards it.To say the ship was
rolling would express but poorly the indescribably disagreeable
wallowing motion of the frigate, while men were staggering with anxious
faces from gun to gun, seeing that the lashings were all secure; so
great was the strain on the cable-like ropes that kept them in their
places.The shot had got loose from the racks, and were having a small
cannonade on their own account, to the no small consternation of the men
whose duty it was to re-secure them.It was literally sea without and
sea within, for the green waves were pouring down the main hatchway,
adding to the amount of water already _below_, where the chairs and
other articles of domestic utility were all afloat and making voyages of
discovery from one officer's cabin to another.On the upper deck all was darkness, confusion, and danger, for both the
fore and main-topsails had been carried away at the same time, reducing
us to one sail--the foresail.The noise and crackling of the riven
canvas, mingling with the continuous roar of the storm, were at times
increased by the rattle of thunder and the rush of rain-drops, while the
lightning played continually around the slippery masts and cordage.About one o'clock, a large ship, apparently unmanageable, was dimly seen
for one moment close aboard of us--had we come into collision the
consequences must have been dreadful;--and thus for two long hours,
_till steam was got up_, did we fly before the gale, after which the
danger was comparatively small.Having spent its fury, having in fact blown itself out of breath, the
wind next day retired to its cave, and the waves got smaller and
beautifully less, till peace and quietness once more reigned around us.Going on deck one morning I found we were anchored under the very shadow
of a steep rock, and not far from a pretty little town at the foot of a
high mountain, which was itself covered to the top with trees and
verdure, with the white walls of many a quaint-looking edifice peeping
through the green--boats, laden with fruit and fish and turtle,
surrounded the ship.The island of Madeira and town, of Funchal.As
there was no pier, we had to land among the stones.The principal
amusement of English residents here seems to be lounging about, cheroot
in mouth, beneath the rows of trees that droop over the pavements,
getting carried about in portable hammocks, and walking or riding (I
rode, and, not being able to get my horse to move at a suitable pace, I
looked behind, and found the boy from whom I had hired him sticking like
a leech to my animal's tail, nor would he be shaken off--nor could the
horse be induced to kick him off; this is the custom of the Funchalites,
and a funny one it is) to the top of the mountain, for the pleasure of
coming down in a sleigh, a distance of two miles, in twice as many
minutes, while the least deviation from the path would result in a
terrible smash against the wall of either side, but I never heard of any
such accident occurring.Three days at Madeira, and up anchor again; our next place of call being
Saint Helena.Every one has heard of the gentleman who wanted to
conquer the world but couldn't, who tried to beat the British but
didn't, who staked his last crown at a game of _loo_, and losing fled,
and fleeing was chased, and being chased was caught and chained by the
leg, like an obstreperous game-cock, to a rock somewhere in the middle
of the sea, on which he stood night and day for years, with his arms
folded across his chest, and his cocked hat wrong on, a warning to the
unco-ambitious.The rock was Saint Helena, and a very beautiful rock it
is too, hill and dell and thriving town, its mountain-sides tilled and
its straths and glens containing many a fertile little farm.It is the
duty of every one who touches the shores of this far-famed island to
make a pilgrimage to Longwood, the burial-place of the "great man."I
have no intention of describing this pilgrimage, for this has been done
by dozens before my time, or, if not, it ought to have been: I shall
merely add a very noticeable fact, which others may not perchance have
observed--_both sides_ of the road all the way to the tomb are strewn
with _Bass's beer-bottles_, empty of course, and at the grave itself
there are hogsheads of them; and the same is the case at every place
which John Bull has visited, or where English foot has ever trodden.The rule holds good all over the world; and in the Indian Ocean,
whenever I found an uninhabited island, or even reef which at some
future day would be an island, if I did not likewise find an empty
beer-bottle, I at once took possession in the name of Queen Victoria,
giving three hips!thrice, and singing "For he's a jolly
good fellow," without any very distinct notion as to who _was_ the jolly
fellow; also adding more decidedly "which nobody can deny"--there being
no one on the island to deny it.England has in this way acquired much additional territory at my hands,
without my having as yet received any very substantial recompense for my
services.THE MODERN RODERICK RANDOM.The duties of the assistant-surgeon--the modern Roderick Random--on
board a line-of-battle ship are seldom very onerous in time of peace,
and often not worth mentioning.Suppose, for example, the reader is
that officer.At five bells--half-past six--in the morning, if you
happen to be a light sleeper, you will be sensible of some one gliding
silently into your cabin, rifling your pockets, and extracting your
watch, your money, and other your trinkets; but do not jump out of bed,
pray, with the intention of collaring him; it is no thief--only your
servant.Formerly this official used to be a marine, with whom on
joining your ship you bargained in the following manner.The marine walked up to you and touched his front hair, saying at the
same time,--

"_I_ don't mind looking arter you, sir," or "I'll do for you, sir."On
which you would reply,--

"All right!and he would answer "Cheeks," or whatever
his name might be.(Cheeks, that is the real Cheeks, being a sort of
visionary soldier--a phantom marine--and very useful at times, answering
in fact to the Nobody of higher quarters, who is to blame for so many
things,--"Nobody is to blame," and "Cheeks is to blame," being
synonymous sentences.)Now-a-days Government kindly allows each commissioned officer one half
of a servant, or one whole one between two officers, which, at times, is
found to be rather an awkward arrangement; as, for instance, you and,
say, the lieutenant of marines, have each the half of the same servant,
and you wish your half to go on shore with a message, and the lieutenant
requires his half to remain on board: the question then comes to be one
which only the wisdom of Solomon could solve, in the same way that
Alexander the Great loosed the Gordian knot.Your servant, then, on entering your cabin in the morning, carefully and
quietly deposits the contents of your pockets on your table, and, taking
all your clothes and your boots in his arms, silently flits from view,
and shortly after re-enters, having in the interval neatly folded and
brushed them.You are just turning round to go to sleep again, when--

"Six bells, sir, please," remarks your man, laying his hand on your
elbow, and giving you a gentle shake to insure your resuscitation, and
which will generally have the effect of causing you to spring at once
from your cot, perhaps in your hurry nearly upsetting the cup of
delicious ship's cocoa which he has kindly saved to you from his own
breakfast--a no small sacrifice either, if you bear in mind that his own
allowance is by no means very large, and that his breakfast consists of
cocoa and biscuits alone--these last too often containing more weevils
than flour.As you hurry into your bath, your servant coolly informs
you--

"Plenty of time, sir."Then," you inquire, "it isn't six bells?""Not a bit on it, sir," he replies; "wants the quarter."At seven o'clock exactly you make your way forward to the sick-bay, on
the lower deck at the ship's bows.Now, this making your way forward
isn't by any means such an easy task as one might imagine; for at that
hour the deck is swarming with the men at their toilet, stripped to the
waist, every man at his tub, lathering, splashing, scrubbing and
rubbing, talking, laughing, joking, singing, sweating, and swearing.Finding your way obstructed, you venture to touch one mildly on the bare
back, as a hint to move aside and let you pass; the man immediately
damns your eyes, then begs pardon, and says he thought it was Bill "at
his lark again."Another who is bending down over his tub you touch
more firmly on the _os innominatum_, and ask him in a free and easy sort
of tone to "slue round there."He "slues round," very quickly too, but
unfortunately in the wrong direction, and ten to one capsizes you in a
tub of dirty soapsuds.Having picked yourself up, you pursue your
journey, and sing out as a general sort of warning--

For the benefit of those happy individuals who never saw, or had to eat,
weevils, I may here state that they are small beetles of the exact size
and shape of the common woodlouse, and that the taste is rather insipid,
with a slight flavour of boiled beans.Never have tasted the woodlouse,
but should think the flavour would be quite similar."Gangway there, lads," which causes at least a dozen of these worthies
to pass such ironical remarks to their companions as--

"Out of the doctor's way there, Tom.""Let the gentleman pass, can't you, Jack?""Port your helm, Mat; the doctor wants you to.""Round with your stern, Bill; the surgeon's _mate_ is a passing.""Kick that donkey Jones out of the doctor's road,"--while at the same
time it is always the speaker himself who is in the way.At last, however, you reach the sick-bay in safety, and retire within
the screen.Here, if a strict service man, you will find the surgeon
already seated; and presently the other assistant enters, and the work
is begun.There is a sick-bay man, or dispenser, and a sick-bay cook,
attached to the medical department.The surgeon generally does the
brain-work, and the assistants the finger-work; and, to their shame be
it spoken, there are some surgeons too proud to consult their younger
brethren, whom they treat as assistant-drudges, not assistant-surgeons.At eight o'clock--before or after,--the work is over, and you are off to
breakfast.At nine o'clock the drum beats, when every one, not otherwise engaged,
is required to muster on the quarter-deck, every officer as he comes up
lifting his cap, not to the captain, but to the Queen.After inspection
the parson reads prayers; you are then free to write, or read, or
anything else in reason you choose; and, if in harbour, you may go on
shore--boats leaving the ship at regular hours for the convenience of
the officers--always premising that one medical man be left on board, in
case of accident.In most foreign ports where a ship may be lying,
there is no want of both pleasure and excitement on shore.Take for
example the little town of Simon's, about twenty miles from Cape Town,
with a population of not less than four thousand of Englishmen, Dutch,
Malays, Caffres, and Hottentots.The bay is large, and almost
landlocked.The little white town is built along the foot of a lofty
mountain.Beautiful walks can be had in every direction, along the hard
sandy sea-beach, over the mountains and on to extensive table-lands, or
away up into dark rocky dingles and heath-clad glens.Nothing can
surpass the beauty of the scenery, or the gorgeous loveliness of the
wild heaths and geraniums everywhere abounding.There is a good hotel
and billiard-room; and you can shoot where, when, and what you please--
monkeys, pigeons, rock rabbits, wild ducks, or cobra-di-capellas.If
you long for more society, or want to see life, get a day or two days'
leave.Rise at five o'clock; the morning will be lovely and clear, with
the mist rising from its flowery bed on the mountain's brow, and the
sun, large and red, entering on a sky to which nor pen nor pencil could
do justice.The cart is waiting for you at the hotel, with an awning
spread above.Jump in: crack goes the long Caffre whip; away with a
plunge and a jerk go the three pairs of Caffre horses, and along the
sea-shore you dash, with the cool sea-breeze in your face, and the
water, green and clear, rippling up over the horses' feet; then, amid
such scenery, with such exhilarating weather, in such a life-giving
climate, if you don't feel a glow of pleasure that will send the blood
tingling through your veins, from the points of your ten toes to the
extreme end of your eyelashes, there must be something radically and
constitutionally wrong with you, and the sooner you go on board and dose
yourself with calomel and jalap the better.Arrived at Cape Town, a few introductions will simply throw the whole
city at your command, and all it contains.I do not intend this as a complete sketch of your trip, or I would have
mentioned some of the many beautiful spots and places of interest you
pass on the road--Rathfeldas for example, a hotel halfway, a house
buried in sweetness; and the country round about, with its dark waving
forests, its fruitful fields and wide-spreading vineyards, where the
grape seems to grow almost without cultivation; its comfortable
farm-houses; and above all its people, kind, generous, and hospitable as
the country is prolific.So you see, dear reader, a navy surgeon's life hath its pleasures.and sorry I am to add, its sufferings too; for a few
pages farther on the picture must change: if we get the lights we must
needs take the shadows also.ENEMY ON THE PORT BOW.We will suppose that the reader still occupies the position of
assistant-surgeon in a crack frigate or saucy line-of-battle ship.If
you go on shore for a walk in the forenoon you may return to lunch at
twelve; or if you have extended your ramble far into the country, or
gone to visit a friend or lady-love--though for the latter the gloaming
hour is to be preferred--you will in all probability have succeeded in
establishing an appetite by half-past five, when the officers'
dinner-boat leaves the pier.Now, I believe there are few people in the world to whom a good dinner
does not prove an attraction, and this is what in a large ship one is
always pretty sure of, more especially on guest-nights, which are
evenings set apart--one every week--for the entertainment of the
officers' friends, one or more of whom any officer may invite, by
previously letting the mess-caterer know of his intention.The
mess-caterer is the officer who has been elected to superintend the
victualling, as the wine-caterer does the liquor department, and a
by-no-means-enviable position it is, and consequently it is for ever
changing hands.Sailors are proverbial growlers, and, indeed, a certain
amount of growling is, and ought to be, permitted in every mess; but it
is scarcely fair for an officer, because his breakfast does not please
him, or if he can't get butter to his cheese after dinner, to launch
forth his indignation at the poor mess-caterer, who most likely is doing
all he can to please.These growlers too never speak right out or
directly to the point.It is all under-the-table stabbing."Such and such a ship that I was in," says growler first, "and such and
such a mess--"

"Oh, by George!"says growler second, "_I_ knew that ship; that was a
mess, and no mistake?""Why, yes," replies number one, "the lunch we got there was better than
the dinner we have in this old clothes-basket."On guest-nights your friend sits beside yourself, of course, and you
attend to his corporeal wants.One of the nicest things about the
service, in my opinion, is the having the band every day at dinner; then
too everything is so orderly; with our president and vice-president, it
is quite like a pleasure party every evening; so that altogether the
dinner, while in harbour, comes to be the great event of the day.And
after the cloth has been removed, and the president, with a preliminary
rap on the table to draw attention, has given the only toast of the
evening, the Queen, and due honour has been paid thereto, and the
bandmaster, who has been keeking in at the door every minute for the
last ten, that he might not make a mistake in the time, has played "God
save the Queen," and returned again to waltzes, quadrilles, or
selections from operas,--then it is very pleasant and delightful to loll
over our walnuts and wine, and half-dream away the half-hour till coffee
is served.Then, to be sure, that little cigar in our canvas
smoking-room outside the wardroom door, though the last, is by no means
the least pleasant part of the _dejeuner_.For my own part, I enjoy the
succeeding hour or so as much as any: when, reclining in an easy chair,
in a quiet corner, I can sip my tea, and enjoy my favourite author to my
heart's content.You must spare half an hour, however, to pay your last
visit to the sick; but this will only tend to make you appreciate your
ease all the more when you have done.So the evening wears away, and by
ten o'clock you will probably just be sufficiently tired to enjoy
thoroughly your little swing-cot and your cool white sheets.At sea, luncheon, or tiffin, is dispensed with, and you dine at
half-past two.Not much difference in the quality of viands after all,
for now-a-days everything worth eating can be procured, in hermetically
sealed tins, capable of remaining fresh for any length of time.There is one little bit of the routine of the service, which at first
one may consider a hardship.You are probably enjoying your deepest, sweetest sleep, rocked in the
cradle of the deep, and gently swaying to and fro in your little cot;
you had turned in with the delicious consciousness of safety, for well
you knew that the ship was far away at sea, far from rock or reef or
deadly shoal, and that the night was clear and collision very
improbable, so you are slumbering like a babe on its mother's breast--as
you are for that matter--for the second night-watch is half spent; when,
mingling confusedly with your dreams, comes the roll of the drum; you
start and listen.There is a moment's pause, when birr-r-r-r it goes
again, and as you spring from your couch you hear it the third time.And now you can distinguish the shouts of officers and petty officers,
high over the din of the trampling of many feet, of the battening down
of hatches, of the unmooring of great guns, and of heavy ropes and bars
falling on the deck: then succeeds a dead silence, soon broken by the
voice of the commander thundering, "Enemy on the port bow;" and then,
and not till then, do you know it is no real engagement, but the monthly
night-quarters.And you can't help feeling sorry there isn't a real
enemy on the port bow, or either bow, as you hurry away to the cockpit,
with the guns rattling all the while overhead, as if a real live
thunderstorm were being taken on board, and was objecting to be stowed
away.So you lay out your instruments, your sponges, your bottles of
wine, and your buckets of water, and, seating yourself in the midst,
begin to read `Midsummer Night's Dream,' ready at a moment's notice to
amputate the leg of any man on board, whether captain, cook, or
cabin-boy.Another nice little amusement the officer of the watch may give himself
on fine clear nights is to set fire to and let go the lifebuoy, at the
same time singing out at the top of his voice, "Man overboard."A boatswain's mate at once repeats the call, and vociferates down the
main hatchway, "Life-boat's crew a-ho-oy!"In our navy a few short but expressive moments of silence ever precede
the battle, that both officers and men may hold communion with their
God.The men belonging to this boat, who have been lying here and there
asleep but dressed, quickly tumble up the ladder pell-mell; there is a
rattling of oars heard, and the creaking of pulleys, then a splash in
the water alongside, the boat darts away from the ship like an arrow
from a bow, and the crew, rowing towards the blazing buoy, save the life
of the unhappy man, Cheeks the marine.And thus do British sailors rule the waves and keep old Neptune in his
own place.CONTAINING--IF NOT THE WHOLE--NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.If the disposing, in the service, of even a ship-load of
assistant-surgeons, is considered a matter of small moment, my disposal,
after reaching the Cape of Good Hope, needs but small comment.I was
very soon appointed to take charge of a gunboat, in lieu of a gentleman
who was sent to the Naval Hospital of Simon's Town, to fill a death
vacancy--for the navy as well as nature abhors a vacuum.I had seen the
bright side of the service, I was now to have my turn of the dark; I had
enjoyed life on board a crack frigate, I was now to rough it in a
gunboat.The east coast of Africa was to be our cruising ground, and our ship a
pigmy steamer, with plenty fore-and-aft about her, but nothing else; in
fact, she was Euclid's definition of a line to a t, length without
breadth, and small enough to have done "excellently well" as a Gravesend
tug-boat.Her teeth were five: namely, one gigantic cannon, a
65-pounder, as front tooth; on each side a brass howitzer; and flanking
these, two canine tusks in shape of a couple of 12-pounder Armstrongs.With this armament we were to lord it with a high hand over the Indian
Ocean; carry fire and sword, or, failing sword, the cutlass, into the
very heart of slavery's dominions; the Arabs should tremble at the roar
of our guns and the thunder of our bursting shells, while the slaves
should clank their chains in joyful anticipation of our coming; and best
of all, we--the officers--should fill our pockets with prize-money to
spend when we again reached the shores of merry England.Unfortunately,
this last premeditation was the only one which sustained disappointment,
for, our little craft being tender to the flag-ship of the station, all
our hard-earned prize-money had to be equally shared with her officers
and crew, which reduced the shares to fewer pence each than they
otherwise would have been pounds, and which was a burning shame.It was the Cape winter when I joined the gunboat.The hills were
covered with purple and green, the air was deliciously cool, and the
far-away mountain-tops were clad in virgin snow.It was twelve o'clock
noon when I took my traps on board, and found my new messmates seated
around the table at tiffin.The gunroom, called the wardroom by
courtesy--for the after cabin was occupied by the lieutenant
commanding--was a little morsel of an apartment, which the table and
five cane-bottomed chairs entirely filled.The officers were five--
namely, a little round-faced, dimple-cheeked, good-natured fellow, who
was our second-master; a tall and rather awkward-looking young
gentleman, our midshipman; a lean, pert, and withal diminutive youth,
brimful of his own importance, our assistant-paymaster; a fair-haired,
bright-eyed, laughing boy from Cornwall, our sub-lieutenant; and a "wee
wee man," dapper, clean, and tidy, our engineer, admitted to this mess
because he was so thorough an exception to his class, which is
celebrated more for the unctuosity of its outer than for the smoothness
of its inner man."Come along, old fellow," said our navigator, addressing me as I entered
the messroom, bobbing and bowing to evade fracture of the cranium by
coming into collision with the transverse beams of the deck above--"come
along and join us, we don't dine till four.""And precious little to dine upon," said the officer on his right."Steward, let us have the rum," [Note 1] cried the first speaker.And thus addressed, the steward shuffled in, bearing in his hand a black
bottle, and apparently in imminent danger of choking himself on a large
mouthful of bread and butter.This functionary's dress was remarkable
rather for its simplicity than its purity, consisting merely of a pair
of dirty canvas pants, a pair of purser's shoes--innocent as yet of
blacking--and a greasy flannel shirt.But, indeed, uniform seemed to be
the exception, and not the rule, of the mess, for, while one wore a blue
serge jacket, another was arrayed in white linen, and the rest had
neither jacket nor vest.The table was guiltless of a cloth, and littered with beer-bottles,
biscuits, onions, sardines, and pats of butter.exclaimed the sub-lieutenant; "that beggar
Dawson is having his own whack o' grog and everybody else's."I'll have _my_ tot to-day, I know," said the
assistant-paymaster, snatching the bottle from Dawson, and helping
himself to a very liberal allowance of the ruby fluid.cried the midshipman, snatching the
glass from the table and bolting the contents at a gulp, adding, with a
gasp of satisfaction as he put down the empty tumbler, "The chap thinks
nobody's got a soul to be saved but himself.""Soul or no soul," replied the youthful man of money as he gazed
disconsolately at the empty glass, "my _spirit's_ gone.""Blessed," said the engineer, shaking the black bottle, "if you devils
have left me a drain!see if I don't look out for A1 to-morrow."And they all said "Where is the doctor's?""See if that beggarly bumboat-man is alongside, and get me another pat
of butter and some soft tack; get the grub first, then tell him I'll pay
to-morrow."These and such like scraps of conversation began to give me a little
insight into the kind of mess I had joined and the character of my
future messmates."Steward," said I, "show me my cabin."He did so;
indeed, he hadn't far to go.It was the aftermost, and consequently the
smallest, although I _ought_ to have had my choice.It was the most
miserable little box I ever reposed in.Had I owned such a place on
shore, I _might_ have been induced to keep rabbits in it, or
guinea-pigs, but certainly not pigeons.Its length was barely six feet,
its width four above my cot and two below, and it was minus sufficient
standing-room for any ordinary-sized sailor; it was, indeed, a cabin for
a commodore--I mean Commodore Nutt--and was ventilated by a scuttle
seven inches in diameter, which could only be removed in harbour, and
below which, when we first went to sea, I was fain to hang a leather
hat-box to catch the water; unfortunately the bottom rotted out, and I
was then at the mercy of the waves.My cabin, or rather--to stick to the plain unvarnished truth--my burrow,
was alive with scorpions, cockroaches, ants, and other "crawlin'
ferlies.""That e'en to name would be unlawfu'."My dispensary was off the steerage, and sister-cabin to the pantry.To
it I gained access by a species of crab-walking, squeezing myself past a
large brass pump, and edging my body in sideways.The sick came one by
one to the dispensary door, and there I saw and treated each case as it
arrived, dressed the wounds and bruises and putrefying sores, and
bandaged the bad legs.There was no sick-berth attendant; to be sure
the lieutenant-in-command, at my request, told off "a little cabin-boy"
for my especial use.I had no cause for delectation on such an
acquisition, by no means; he was not a model cabin-boy like what you see
in theatres, and I believe will never become an admiral.He managed at
times to wash out the dispensary, or gather cockroaches, and make the
poultices--only in doing the first he broke the bottles, and in
performing the last duty he either let the poultice burn or put salt in
it; and, finally, he smashed my pot, and I kicked him forward, and
demanded another._He_ was slightly better, only he was seldom visible;
and when I set him to do anything, he at once went off into a sweet
slumber; so I kicked him forward too, and had in despair to become my
own menial.In both dispensary and burrow it was quite a difficult
business to prevent everything going to speedy destruction.The best
portions of my uniform got eaten by cockroaches or moulded by damp,
while my instruments required cleaning every morning, and even that did
not keep rust at bay.Imagine yourself dear reader, in any of the following interesting
positions:--

Very thirsty, and nothing but boiling hot newly distilled water to
drink; or wishing a cool bath of a morning, and finding the water in
your can only a little short of 212 degrees Fahrenheit.To find, when you awake, a couple of cockroaches, two inches in length,
busy picking your teeth.To find one in a state of decay in the mustard-pot.To have to arrange all the droppings and eggs of these interesting
creatures on the edge of your plate, previous to eating your soup.To have to beat out the dust and weevils from every square inch of
biscuit before putting it in your mouth.To be looking for a book and put your hand on a full-grown scaly
scorpion.Nice sensation--the animal twining round your finger, or
running up your sleeve._Denouement_--cracking him under foot--
full-flavoured bouquet--joy at escaping a sting.You are enjoying your dinner, but have been for some time sensible of a
strange titillating feeling about the region of your ankle; you look down
at last to find a centipede on your sock, with his fifty hind-legs--you
thank God not his fore fifty--abutting on to your shin._Tableau_--
green and red light from the eyes of the many-legged; horror of yourself
as you wait till he thinks proper to "move on."To awake in the morning, and find a large and healthy-looking tarantula
squatting on your pillow within ten inches of your nose, with his
basilisk eyes fixed on yours, and apparently saying, "You're only just
awake, are you?I've been sitting here all the morning watching you."You know if you move he'll bite you, somewhere; and if he _does_ bite
you, you'll go mad and dance _ad libitum_; so you twist your mouth in
the opposite direction and ejaculate--

"Steward!"but the steward does not come--in fact he is forward, seeing
after the breakfast.Meanwhile the gentleman on the pillow is moving
his horizontal mandibles in a most threatening manner, and just as he
makes a rush for your nose you tumble out of bed with a shriek; and, if
a very nervous person, probably run on deck in your shirt.Or, to fall asleep under the following circumstances: The bulkheads, all
around, black with cock-and-hen-roaches, a few of which are engaged
cropping your toe-nails, or running off with little bits of the skin of
your calves; bugs in the crevices of your cot, a flea tickling the sole
of your foot, a troop of ants carrying a dead cockroach over your
pillow, lively mosquitoes attacking you everywhere, hammer-legged flies
occasionally settling on your nose, rats running in and rats running
out, your lamp just going out, and the delicious certainty that an
indefinite number of earwigs and scorpions, besides two centipedes and a
tarantula, are hiding themselves somewhere in your cabin.Officers, as well as men, are allowed one half-gill of rum
daily, with this difference,--the former pay for theirs, while the
latter do not.ROUND THE CAPE AND UP THE 'BIQUE.It was a dark-grey cloudy forenoon when we "up anchor" and sailed from
Simon's Bay.Frequent squalls whitened the water, and there was every
indication of our being about to have dirty weather; and the tokens told
no lies.To our little craft, however, the foul weather that followed
seemed to be a matter of very little moment; for, when the wind or waves
were in any way high, she kept snugly below water, evidently thinking
more of her own convenience than our comfort, for such a procedure on
her part necessitated our leading a sort of amphibious existence, better
suited to the tastes of frogs than human beings.Our beds too, or
matresses, became converted into gigantic poultices, in which we nightly
steamed, like as many porkers newly shaven.Judging from the amount of
salt which got encrusted on our skins, there was little need to fear
danger, we were well preserved--so much so indeed, that, but for the
constant use of the matutinal freshwater bath, we would doubtless have
shared the fate of Lot's wife and been turned into pillars of salt.After being a few days at sea the wind began to moderate, and finally
died away; and instead thereof we had thunderstorms and waves, which, if
not so big as mountains, would certainly have made pretty large hills.Many a night did we linger on deck till well nigh morning, entranced by
the sublime beauty and terrible grandeur of those thunderstorms.The
roar and rattle of heaven's artillery; the incessant _floods_ of
lightning--crimson, blue, or white; our little craft hanging by the bows
to the crest of each huge inky billow, or next moment buried in the
valley of the waves, with a wall of black waters on every side; the wet
deck, the slippery shrouds, and the faces of the men holding on to the
ropes and appearing so strangely pale in the electric light; I see the
whole picture even now as I write--a picture, indeed, that can never,
never fade from my memory.Our cruising "ground" lay between the island and town of Mozambique in
the south, to about Magadoxa, some seven or eight degrees north of the
Equator.Nearly the whole of the slave-trade is carried on by the Arabs, one or
two Spaniards sometimes engaging in it likewise.The slaves are brought
from the far interior of South Africa, where they can be purchased for a
small bag of rice each.They are taken down in chained gangs to the
coast, and there in some secluded bay the dhows lie, waiting to take
them on board and convey them to the slave-mart at Zanzibar, to which
place Arab merchants come from the most distant parts of Arabia and
Persia to buy them.Dhows are vessels with one or two masts, and a
corresponding number of large sails, and of a very peculiar
construction, being shaped somewhat like a short or Blucher boot, the
high part of the boot representing the poop.They have a thatched roof
over the deck, the projecting eaves of which render boarding exceedingly
difficult to an enemy.Sometimes, on rounding the corner of a lagoon island, we would quietly
and unexpectedly steam into the midst of a fleet of thirty to forty of
these queer-looking vessels, very much to our own satisfaction, and
their intense consternation.Imagine a cat popping down among as many
mice, and you will be able to form some idea of the scramble that
followed.However, by dint of steaming here and there, and expending a
great deal of shot and shell, we generally managed to keep them together
as a dog would a flock of sheep, until we examined all their papers with
the aid of our interpreter, and probably picked out a prize.I wish I could say the prizes were anything like numerous; for perhaps
one-half of all the vessels we board are illicit slaveholders, and yet
we cannot lay a finger on them.It has been
said, and it is generally believed in England, that our cruisers are
sweeping the Indian Ocean of slavers, and stamping out the curse.But
the truth is very different, and all that we are doing, or able at
present to do, is but to pull an occasional hair from the hoary locks of
the fiend Slavery.This can be proved from the return-sheets, which
every cruiser sends home, of the number of vessels boarded, generally
averaging one thousand yearly to each man-o'-war, of which the half at
least have slaves or slave-irons on board; but only two, or at most
three, of these will become prizes.The reason of this will easily be
understood, when the reader is informed, that the Sultan of Zanzibar has
liberty to take any number of slaves from any one portion of his
dominions to another: these are called household slaves; and, as his
dominions stretch nearly all along the eastern shores of Africa, it is
only necessary for the slave-dealer to get his sanction and seal to his
papers in order to steer clear of British law.This, in almost every
case, can be accomplished by means of a bribe.So slavery flourishes,
the Sultan draws a good fat revenue from it, and the Portuguese--no
great friends to us at any time--laugh and wink to see John Bull paying
his thousands yearly for next to nothing.Supposing we liberate even
two thousand slaves a year, which I am not sure we do however, there are
on the lowest estimate six hundred slaves bought and sold daily in
Zanzibar mart; two hundred and nineteen thousand in a twelvemonth; and,
of our two thousand that are set free in Zanzibar, most, if not all,
by-and-bye, become bondsmen again.I am not an advocate for slavery, and would like to see a wholesale raid
made against it, but I do not believe in the retail system; selling
freedom in pennyworths, and spending millions in doing it, is very like
burning a penny candle in seeking for a cent.Yet I sincerely believe,
that there is more good done to the spread of civilisation and religion
in one year, by the slave-traffic, than all our missionaries can do in a
hundred.Don't open your eyes and smile incredulously, intelligent
reader; we live in an age when every question is looked at on both
sides, and why should not this?What becomes of the hundreds of
thousands of slaves that are taken from Africa?They are sold to the
Arabs--that wonderful race, who have been second only to Christians in
the good they have done to civilisation; they are taken from a state of
degradation, bestiality, and wretchedness, worse by far than that of the
wild beasts, and from a part of the country too that is almost unfit to
live in, and carried to more favoured lands, spread over the sunny
shores of fertile Persia and Arabia, fed and clothed and cared for;
after a few years of faithful service they are even called sons and feed
at their master's table--taught all the trades and useful arts, besides
the Mahommedan religion, which is certainly better than none--and, above
all, have a better chance given them of one day hearing and learning the
beautiful tenets of Christianity, the religion of love.I have met with few slaves who after a few years did not say, "Praised
be Allah for the good day I was take from me coontry!"and whose only
wish to return was, that they might bring away some aged parent, or
beloved sister, from the dark cheerless home of their infancy.Means and measures much more energetic must be brought into action if
the stronghold of slavedom is to be stormed, and, if not, it were better
to leave it alone."If the work be of God ye cannot overthrow it; lest
haply ye be found to fight even against God."THE DAYS WHEN WE WENT GIPSYING.QUILP THE
PILOT AND LAMOO.It might have been that our vessel was launched on a Friday, or sailed
on a Friday; or whether it was owing to our carrying the devil on board
of us in shape of a big jet-black cat, and for whom the lifebuoy was
thrice let go, and boats lowered in order to save his infernal majesty
from a watery grave; but whatever was the reason, she was certainly a
most unlucky ship from first to last; for during a cruise of eighteen
months, four times did we run aground on dangerous reefs, twice were we
on fire--once having had to scuttle the decks--once we sprung a bad leak
and were nearly foundering, several times we narrowly escaped the same
speedy termination to our cruise by being taken aback, while, compared
to our smaller dangers or lesser perils, Saint Paul's adventures--as a
Yankee would express it--wern't a circumstance.On the other hand, we were amply repaid by the many beautiful spots we
visited; the lovely wooded creeks where the slave-dhows played at hide
and seek with us, and the natural harbours, at times surrounded by
scenery so sweetly beautiful and so charmingly solitary, that, if
fairies still linger on this earth, one must think they would choose
just such places as these for their moonlight revels.Then there were
so many little towns--Portuguese settlements--to be visited, for the
Portuguese have spread themselves, after the manner of wild
strawberries, all round the coast of Africa, from Sierra Leone on the
west to Zanzibar on the east.There was as much sameness about these
settlements as about our visits to them: a few houses--more like tents--
built on the sand (it does seem funny to see sofas, chairs, and the
piano itself standing among the deep soft sand); a fort, the guns of
which, if fired, would bring down the walls; a few white-jacketed
swarthy-looking soldiers; a very polite governor, brimful of hospitality
and broken English; and a good dinner, winding up with punch of
schnapps.Memorable too are the pleasant boating excursions we had on the calm
bosom of the Indian Ocean.Armed boats used to be detached to cruise
for three or four weeks at a time in quest of prizes, at the end of
which time they were picked up at some place of rendezvous.By day we
sailed about the coast and around the small wooded islets, where dhows
might lurk, only landing in sheltered nooks to cook and eat our food.Our provisions were ship's, but at times we drove great bargains with
the naked natives for fowls and eggs and goats; then would we make
delicious soups, rich ragouts, and curries fit for the king of the
Cannibal Islands.Fruit too we had in plenty, and the best of oysters
for the gathering, with iguana most succulent of lizards, occasionally
fried flying-fish, or delicate morsels of shark, skip-jack, or devilled
dolphin, with a glass of prime rum to wash the whole down, and three
grains of quinine to charm away the fever.There was, too, about these
expeditions, an air of gipsying that was quite pleasant.To be sure our
beds were a little hard, but we did not mind that; while clad in our
blanket-suits, and covered with a boat-sail, we could defy the dew.Sleep, or rather the want of sleep, we seldom had to complain of, for
the blue star-lit sky above us, the gentle rising and falling of the
anchored boat, the lip-lipping of the water, and the sighing sound of
the wind through the great forest near us--all tended to woo us to
sweetest slumber.Sometimes we would make long excursions up the rivers of Africa,
combining business with pleasure, enjoying the trip, and at the same
time gleaning some useful information regarding slave or slave-ship.The following sketch concerning one or two of these may tend to show,
that a man does not take leave of all enjoyment, when his ship leaves
the chalky cliffs of old England.Our anchor was dropped outside the bar of Inambane river; the grating
noise of the chain as it rattled through the hawse-hole awoke me, and I
soon after went on deck.It was just six o'clock and a beautiful clear
morning, with the sun rising red and rosy--like a portly gentleman
getting up from his wine--and smiling over the sea in quite a pleasant
sort of way.So, as both Neptune and Sol seemed propitious, the
commander, our second-master, and myself made up our minds to visit the
little town and fort of Inambane, about forty--we thought fifteen--miles
up the river.But breakfast had to be prepared and eaten, the magazine
and arms got into the boat, besides a day's provisions, with rum and
quinine to be stowed away, so that the sun had got a good way up the
sky, and now looked more like a portly gentleman whose dinner had
disagreed, before we had got fairly under way and left the ship's side.Never was forenoon brighter or fairer, only one or two snowy banks of
cloud interrupting the blue of the sky, while the river, miles broad,
stole silently seaward, unruffled by wave or wavelet, so that the hearts
of both men and officers were light as the air they breathed was pure.The men, bending cheerfully on their oars, sang snatches of Dibdin--
Neptune's poet laureate; and we, tired of talking, reclined astern,
gazing with half-shut eyes on the round undulating hills, that, covered
with low mangrove-trees and large exotics, formed the banks of the
river.We passed numerous small wooded islands and elevated sandbanks,
on the edges of which whole regiments of long-legged birds waded about
in search of food, or, starting at our approach, flew over our heads in
Indian file, their bright scarlet-and-white plumage showing prettily
against the blue of the sky.Shoals of turtle floated past, and
hundreds of rainbow- jelly-fishes, while, farther off, many
large black bodies--the backs of hippopotami--moved on the surface of
the water, or anon disappeared with a sullen plash.Saving these sounds
and the dip of our own oars, all was still, the silence of the desert
reigned around us, the quiet of a newly created world.The forenoon wore away, the river got narrower, but, though we could see
a distance of ten miles before us, neither life nor sign of life could
be perceived.At one o'clock we landed among a few cocoa-nut trees to
eat our meagre dinner, a little salt pork, raw, and a bit of biscuit.No sooner had we "shoved off" again than the sky became overcast; we
were caught in, and had to pull against, a blinding white-squall that
would have laid a line-of-battle on her beam ends.The rain poured down
as if from a water-spout, almost filling the boat and drenching us to
the skin, and, not being able to see a yard ahead, our boat ran aground
and stuck fast.It took us a good hour after the squall was over to
drag her into deep water; nor were our misfortunes then at an end, for
squall succeeded squall, and, having a journey of uncertain length still
before us, we began to feel very miserable indeed.It was long after four o'clock when, tired, wet, and hungry, we hailed
with joy a large white house on a wooded promontory; it was the
Governor's castle, and soon after we came in sight of the town itself.Situated so far in the interior of Africa, in a region so wild, few
would have expected to find such a little paradise as we now beheld,--a
colony of industrious Portuguese, a large fort and a company of
soldiers, a governor and consulate, a town of nice little detached
cottages, with rows of cocoa-nut, mango, and orange trees, and in fact
all the necessaries, and luxuries of civilised life.It was, indeed, an
oasis in the desert, and, to us, the most pleasant of pleasant
surprises.Leaving the men for a short time with the boat, we made our way to the
house of the consul, a dapper little gentleman with a pretty wife and
two beautiful daughters--flowers that had hitherto blushed unseen and
wasted their sweetness in the desert air.After making us swallow a glass of brandy
each to keep off fever, he kindly led us to a room, and made us strip
off our wet garments, while a servant brought bundle after bundle of
clothes, and spread them out before us.There were socks and shirts and
slippers galore, with waistcoats, pantaloons, and head-dresses, and
jackets, enough to have dressed an opera troupe.The commander and I
furnished ourselves with a red Turkish fez and dark-grey dressing-gown
each, with cord and tassels to correspond, and, thus, arrayed, we
considered ourselves of no small account.Our kind entertainers were
waiting for us in the next room, where they had, in the mean time, been
preparing for us the most fragrant of brandy punch.By-and-bye two
officers and a tall Parsee dropped in, and for the next hour or so the
conversation was of the most animated and lively description, although a
bystander, had there been one, would not have been much edified, for the
following reason: the younger daughter and myself were flirting in the
ancient Latin language, with an occasional soft word in Spanish; our
commander was talking in bad French to the consul's lady, who was
replying in Portuguese; the second-master was maintaining a smart
discussion in broken Italian with the elder daughter; the Parsee and
officer of the fort chiming in, the former in English, the latter in
Hindostanee; but as no one of the four could have had the slightest idea
of the other's meaning, the amount of information given and received
must have been very small,--in fact, merely nominal.It must not,
however, be supposed that our host or hostesses could speak _no_
English, for the consul himself would frequently, and with a bow that
was inimitable, push the bottle towards the commander, and say, as he
shrugged his shoulders and turned his palms skywards, "Continue you, Sar
Capitan, to wet your whistle;" and, more than once, the fair creature by
my side would raise and did raise the glass to her lips, and say, as her
eyes sought mine, "Good night, Sar Officeer," as if she meant me to be
off to bed without a moment's delay, which I knew she did not.Then,
when I responded to the toast, and complimented her on her knowledge of
the "universal language," she added, with a pretty shake of the head,
"No, Sar Officeer, I no can have speak the mooch Englese."A servant,--
apparently newly out of prison, so closely was his hair cropped,--
interrupted our pleasant confab, and removed the seat of our Babel to
the dining-room, where as nicely-cooked-and-served a dinner as ever
delighted the senses of hungry mortality awaited our attention.No
large clumsy joints, huge misshapen roasts or bulky boils, hampered the
board; but dainty made-dishes, savoury stews, piquant curries, delicate
fricassees whose bouquet tempted even as their taste and flavour
stimulated the appetite, strange little fishes as graceful in shape as
lovely in colour, vegetables that only the rich luxuriance of an African
garden could supply, and numerous other nameless nothings, with
delicious wines and costly liqueurs, neatness, attention, and kindness,
combined to form our repast, and counteract a slight suspicion of
crocodiles' tails and stewed lizard, for where ignorance is bliss a
fellow is surely a fool if he is wise.We spent a most pleasant evening in asking questions, spinning yarns,
singing songs, and making love.The younger daughter--sweet child of
the desert--sang `Amante de alguno;' her sister played a selection from
`La Traviata;' next, the consul's lady favoured us with something
pensive and sad, having reference, I think, to bright eyes, bleeding
hearts, love, and slow death; then, the Parsee chanted a Persian hymn
with an "Allalallala," instead of Fol-di-riddle-ido as a chorus, which
elicited "Fra poco a me" from the Portuguese lieutenant; and this last
caused our commander to seat himself at the piano, turn up the white of
his eyes, and in very lugubrious tones question the probability of
"Gentle Annie's" ever reappearing in any spring-time whatever; then,
amid so much musical sentimentality and woe, it was not likely that I
was to hold my peace, so I lifted up my voice and sang--

  "Cauld kail in Aberdeen,
  An' cas ticks in Strathbogie;
  Ilka chiel maun hae a quean
  Bit leeze me on ma cogie--"

with a pathos that caused the tears to trickle over and adown the nose
of the younger daughter--she was of the gushing temperament--and didn't
leave a dry eye in the room.The song brought down the house--so to
speak--and I was the hero for the rest of the evening.Before parting
for the night we also sang `Auld lang syne,' copies of the words having
been written out and distributed, to prevent mistakes; this was supposed
by our hostess to be the English national anthem.It was with no small amount of regret that we parted from our friends
next day; a fresh breeze carried us down stream, and, except our running
aground once or twice, and being nearly drowned in crossing the bar, we
arrived safely on board our saucy gunboat.------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Afric's sunny fountains" have been engaged for such a length of time in
the poetical employment of "rolling down their golden sands," that a
bank or bar of that same bright material has been formed at the mouth of
every river, which it is very difficult and often dangerous to cross
even in canoes.We had despatched boats before us to take soundings on
the bar of Lamoo, and prepared to follow in the track thus marked out.Now, our little bark, although not warranted, like the Yankee boat, to
float wherever there is a heavy dew, was nevertheless content with a
very modest allowance of the aqueous element; in two and a half fathoms
she was quite at home, and even in two--with the help of a few
breakers--she never failed to bump it over a bar.We approached the bar
of Lamoo, therefore, with a certain degree of confidence till the keel
rasped on the sand; this caused us to turn astern till we rasped again;
then, being neither able to get back nor forward, we stopped ship, put
our fingers in our wise mouths, and tried to consider what next was to
be done.Just then a small canoe was observed coming bobbing over the
big waves that tumbled in on the bar; at one moment it was hidden behind
a breaker, next moment mounting over another, and so, after a little
game at bo-peep, it got alongside, and from it there scrambled on board
a little, little man, answering entirely to Dickens's description of
Quilp.added I, "by all that's small and ugly.""Your sarvant, sar," said Quilp himself.There
certainly was not enough of him to make two.He was rather darker in
skin than the Quilp of Dickens, and his only garment was a coal-sack
without sleeves--no coal-sack _has_ sleeves, however--begirt with a
rope, in which a short knife was stuck; he had, besides, sandals on his
feet, and his temples were begirt with a dirty dishclout by way of
turban, and he repeated, "I am one pilot, sar.""I do it, sar, plenty quick."I do him," cried the little man, as he mounted the
bridge; then cocking his head to one side, and spreading out his arms
like a badly feathered duck, he added, "Suppose I no do him plenty
proper, you catchee me and make shot.""If the vessel strikes, I'll hang you, sir."Quilp grinned--which was his way of smiling."And a half three," sung the man in the chains; then, "And a half four;"
and by-and-bye, "And a half three" again; followed next moment by, "By
the deep three."We were on the dreaded bar; on each
side of us the big waves curled and broke with a sullen boom like
far-off thunder; only, where we were, no waves broke."Mind yourself now," cried the commander to Quilp; to which he in wrath
replied--

"What for you stand there make bobbery?_I_ is de cap'n; suppose you is
fear, go alow, sar."and a large wave broke right aboard of us, almost sweeping us
from the deck, and lifting the ship's head into the sky.Another and
another followed; but amid the wet and the spray, and the roar of the
breakers, firmly stood the little pilot, coolly giving his orders, and
never for an instant taking his eyes from the vessel's jib-boom and the
distant shore, till we were safely through the surf and quietly steaming
up the river.After proceeding some miles, native villages began to appear here and
there on both shores, and the great number of dhows on the river, with
boats and canoes of every description, told us we were nearing a large
town.Two hours afterwards we were anchored under the guns of the
Sultan's palace, which were belching forth fire and smoke in return for
the salute we had fired.We found every creature and thing in Lamoo as
entirely primitive, as absolutely foreign, as if it were a city in some
other planet.The most conspicuous building is the Sultan's lofty fort
and palace, with its spacious steps, its fountains and marble halls.The streets are narrow and confused; the houses built in the Arab
fashion, and in many cases connected by bridges at the top; the
inhabitants about forty thousand, including Arabs, Persians, Hindoos,
Somali Indians, and slaves.The wells, exceedingly deep, are built in
the centre of the street without any protection; and girls, carrying on
their heads calabashes, are continually passing to and from them.Slaves, two and two, bearing their burdens of cowries and ivory on poles
between, and keeping step to an impromptu chant; black girls weaving
mats and grass-cloth; strange-looking tradesmen, with stranger tools, at
every door; rich merchants borne along in gilded palanquins; people
praying on housetops; and the Sultan's ferocious soldiery prowling
about, with swords as tall, and guns nearly twice as tall, as
themselves; a large shark-market; a fine bazaar, with gold-dust, ivory,
and tiger-skins exposed for sale; sprightly horses with gaudy trappings;
solemn-looking camels; dust and stench and a general aroma of savage
life and customs pervading the atmosphere, but law and order
nevertheless.No
spirituous liquor of any sort is sold in the town; the Sultan's soldiers
go about the streets at night, smelling the breath of the suspected, and
the faintest odour of the accursed fire-water dooms the poor mortal to
fifty strokes with a thick bamboo-cane next morning.The sugar-cane
grows wild in the fertile suburbs, amid a perfect forest of fine trees;
farther out in the country the cottager dwells beneath his few cocoa-nut
trees, which supply him with all the necessaries of life.One tree for
each member of his family is enough._He_ builds the house and fences
with its large leaves; his wife prepares meat and drink, cloth and oil,
from the nut; the space between the trees is cultivated for curry, and
the spare nuts are sold to purchase luxuries, and the rent of twelve
trees is only _sixpence_ of our money.no drunkenness,
no debt, no religious strife, but peace and contentment everywhere!Reader, if you are in trouble, or your affairs are going "to pot," or if
you are of opinion that this once favoured land is getting used up, I
sincerely advise you to sell off your goods and be off to Lamoo.Of the "gentlemen of England who live at home at ease," very few can
know how entirely dependent for happiness one is on his neighbours.Man
is out-and-out, or out-and-in, a gregarious animal, else `Robinson
Crusoe' had never been written.Now, I am sure that it is only correct
to state that the majority of combatant [Note 1] officers are, in simple
language, jolly nice fellows, and as a class gentlemen, having, in fact,
that fine sense of honour, that good-heartedness, which loves to do as
it would be done by, which hurteth not the feelings of the humble, which
turneth aside from the worm in its path, and delighteth not in plucking
the wings from the helpless fly.To believe, however, that there are no
exceptions to this rule would be to have faith in the speedy advent of
the millennium, that happy period of lamb-and-lion-ism which we would
all rather see than hear tell of; for human nature is by no means
altered by bathing every morning in salt water, it is the same afloat as
on shore.And there are many officers in the navy, who--"dressed in a
little brief authority," and wearing an additional stripe--love to lord
it over their fellow worms.Nor is this fault altogether absent from
the medical profession itself!It is in small gunboats, commanded perhaps by a lieutenant, and carrying
only an assistant-surgeon, where a young medical officer feels all the
hardships and despotism of the service; for if the lieutenant in command
happens to be at all frog-hearted, he has then a splendid opportunity of
puffing himself up.In a large ship with from twenty to thirty officers in the mess, if you
do not happen to meet with a kindred spirit at one end of the table, you
can shift your chair to the other.But in a gunboat on foreign service,
with merely a clerk, a blatant middy, and a second-master who would fain
be your senior, as your messmates, then, I say, God help you!unless you
have the rare gift of doing anything for a quiet life.It is all
nonsense to say, "Write a letter on service about any grievance;" you
can't write about ten out of a thousand of the petty annoyances which go
to make your life miserable; and if you do, you will be but little
better, if, indeed, your last state be not worse than your first.I have in my mind's eye even now a lieutenant who commanded a gunboat in
which I served as medical officer in charge.This little man was what
is called a sea-lawyer--my naval readers well know what I mean; he knew
all the Admiralty Instructions, was an amateur engineer, only needed the
title of M.D.to make him a doctor, could quibble and quirk, and in fact
could prove by the Queen's Regulations that your soul, to say nothing of
your body, wasn't your own; that _you_ were a slave, and _he_ lord--god
of all he surveyed.he has gone to his account; he
will not require an advocate, he can speak for himself.Not many such
hath the service, I am happy to say.He was continually changing his
poor hard-worked sub-lieutenants, and driving his engineers to drink,
previously to trying them by court-martial.At first he and I got on
very well; apparently he "loved me like a vera brither;" but we did not
continue long "on the same platform," and, from the day we had the first
difference of opinion, he was my foe, and a bitter one too.I assure
you, reader, it gave me a poor idea of the service, for it was my first
year.He was always on the outlook for faults, and his kindest words to
me were "chaffing" me on my accent, or about my country.To be able to
meet him on his own ground I studied the Instructions day and night, and
tried to stick by them.Malingering was common on board; one or two whom I caught I turned to
duty: the men, knowing how matters stood between the commander and me,
refused to work, and so I was had up and bullied on the quarter-deck for
"neglect of duty" in not putting these fellows on the sick-list.After
this I had to put every one that asked on the sick-list."Doctor," he would say to me on reporting the number sick, "this is
_wondrous_ strange--_thirteen_ on the list, out of only ninety men.Why, sir, I've been in line-of-battle ships,--_line-of-battle_ ships,
sir,--where they had not ten sick--_ten sick_, sir."This of course
implied an insult to me, but I was like a sheep before the shearers,
dumb.On Sunday mornings I went with him the round of inspection; the sick who
were able to be out of hammock were drawn up for review: had he been
half as particular with the men under his own charge or with the ship in
general as he was with the few sick, there would have been but little
disease to treat.Instead of questioning _me_ concerning their
treatment, he interrogated the sick themselves, quarrelling with the
medicine given, and pooh-pooh-ing my diagnosis.Those in hammocks, who
most needed gentleness and comfort, he bullied, blamed for being ill,
and rendered generally uneasy.Remonstrance on my part was either taken
no notice of, or instantly checked.If men were reported by me for
being dirty, giving impudence, or disobeying orders, _he_ became their
advocate--an able one too--and _I_ had to retire, sorry I had spoken.But I would not tell the tenth part of what I had to suffer, because
such men as he are the _exception_, and because he is dead.A little
black baboon of a boy who attended on this lieutenant-commanding had one
day incurred his displeasure: "Bo'swain's mate," cried he, "take my boy
forward, hoist him on an ordinary seaman's back, and give him a
rope's-ending; and," turning to me, "Doctor, you'll go and attend my
boy's flogging."With a face like crimson I rushed
below to my cabin, and--how could I help it?--made a baby of myself for
once; all my pent-up feelings found vent in a long fit of crying.True, I might in this case have written a letter to the service about my
treatment; but, as it is not till after twelve months the
assistant-surgeon is confirmed, the commander's word would have been
taken before mine, and I probably dismissed without a court-martial.That probationary year I consider more than a grievance, it is a _cruel
injustice_.There is a regulation--of late more strictly enforced by a
circular--that every medical officer serving on board his own ship shall
have a cabin, and the choice--by rank--of cabin, and he is a fool if he
does not enforce it.But it sometimes happens that a sub-lieutenant
(who has no cabin) is promoted to lieutenant on a foreign station; he
will then rank above the assistant-surgeon, and perhaps, if there is no
spare cabin, the poor doctor will have to give up his, and take to a
sea-chest and hammock, throwing all his curiosities, however valuable,
overboard.It would be the duty of the captain in such a case to build
an additional cabin, and if he did not, or would not, a letter to the
admiral would make him.Does the combatant officer treat the medical officer with respect?Certainly, unless one or other of the two be a snob: in the one case the
respect is not worth having, in the other it can't be expected.In the military branch you shall find many officers belonging to the
best English families: these I need hardly say are for the most part
gentlemen, and gentle men.However, it is allowed in most messes that

  "The rank is but the guinea's stamp,
  A man's man for a' that;"

and I assure the candidate for a commission, that, if he is himself a
gentleman, he will find no want of admirers in the navy.But there are
some young doctors who enter the service, knowing their profession to be
sure, and how to hold a knife and fork--not a carving-fork though--but
knowing little else; yet even these soon settle down, and, if they are
not dismissed by court-martial for knocking some one down at cards, or
on the quarter-deck, turn out good service-officers.Indeed, after all,
I question if it be good to know too much of fine-gentility on entering
the service, for, although the navy officers one meets have much that is
agreeable, honest, and true, there is through it all a vein of what can
only be designated as the coarse.The science of conversation, that
beautiful science that says and lets say, that can listen as well as
speak, is but little studied.Mostly all the talk is "shop," or rather
"ship."There is a want of tone in the discourse, a lack of refinement.The delicious chit-chat on new books, authors, poetry, music, or the
drama, interspersed with anecdote, incident, and adventure, and
enlivened with the laughter-raising pun or happy bon-mot, is, alas!but
too seldom heard: the rough joke, the tales of women, ships, and former
ship-mates, and the old, old, stale "good things,"--these are more
fashionable at our navy mess-board.Those who would object to such
conversation are in the minority, and prefer to let things hang as they
grew.Now, only one thing can ever alter this, and that is a good and
perfect library in every ship, to enable officers, who spend most of
their time out of society, to keep up with the times if possible.But I
fear I am drifting imperceptibly into the subject of navy-reform, which
I prefer leaving to older and wiser heads.Combatant (from combat, a battle), fighting officers,--as if
the medical offices didn't fight likewise.It would be better to take
away the "combat," and leave the "ant"--ant-officers, as they do the
work of the ship.There is one grievance which the medical officers, in common with their
combatant brethren, have to complain of--I refer to _compulsory
shaving_; neither is this by any means so insignificant a matter as it
may seem.It may appear a ridiculous statement, but it is nevertheless
a true one, that this regulation has caused many a young surgeon to
prefer the army to the navy."Mere dandies," the reader may say, "whom
this grievance would affect;" but there is many a good man a dandy, and
no one could surely respect a man who was careless of his personal
appearance, or who would willingly, and without a sigh, disfigure his
face by depriving it of what nature considers both ornate and useful--
ornate, as the ladies and the looking-glass can prove; and useful, as
the blistered chin and upper lip of the shaven sailor, in hot climates,
points out.From the earliest ages the moustache has been worn,--even
the Arabs, who shave the head, leave untouched the upper lip.What
would the pictures of some of the great masters be without it?Didn't
the Roman youths dedicate the first few downy hairs of the coming
moustache to the gods?Does not the moustache give a manly appearance
to the smallest and most effeminate?Does it not even beget a certain
amount of respect for the wearer?What sort of guys would the razor
make of Count Bismark, Dickens, the Sultan of Turkey, or Anthony
Trollope?Were the Emperor Napoleon deprived of his well-waxed
moustache, it might lose him the throne of France.Were Garibaldi to
call on his barber, he might thereafter call in vain for volunteers, and
English ladies would send him no more splints nor sticking-plaster.Shave Tennyson, and you may put him in petticoats as soon as you please.As to the moustache movement in the navy, it is a subject of talk--
admitting of no discussion--in every mess in the service, and thousands
are the advocates in favour of its adoption.Indeed, the arguments in
favour of it are so numerous, that it is a difficult matter to choose
the best, while the reasons against it are few, foolish, and despotic.At the time when the Lords of the Admiralty gave orders that the navy
should keep its upper lip, and three fingers' breadth of its royal chin,
smooth and copper-kettlish, it was neither fashionable nor respectable
to wear the moustache in good society.Those were the days of
cabbage-leaf cheeks, powdered wigs, and long queues; but those times are
past and gone from every corner of England's possessions save the navy.Barberism has been hunted from polite circles, but has taken refuge
under the trident of old Neptune; and, in these days of comparative
peace, more blood in the Royal Navy is drawn by the razor than by the
cutlass.In our little gunboat on the coast of Africa, we, both officers and men,
used, under the rose, to cultivate moustache and whiskers, until we fell
in with the ship of the commodore of the station.Then, when the
commander gave the order, "All hands to shave," never was such a
hurlyburly seen, such racing hither and thither (for not a moment was to
be lost), such sharpening of scissors and furbishing up of rusty razors.On one occasion I remember sending our steward, who was lathering his
face with a blacking-brush, and trying to scrape with a carving-knife,
to borrow the commander's razor; in the mean time the commander had
despatched his soapy-faced servant to beg the loan of mine.Both
stewards met with a clash, nearly running each other through the body
with their shaving gear.I lent the commander a Syme's bistoury, with
which he managed to pluck most of the hairs out by the root, as if he
meant to transplant them again, while I myself shaved with an amputating
knife.The men forward stuck by the scissors; and when the commander,
with bloody chin and watery eyes, asked why they did not shave,--"Why,
sir," replied the bo'swain's mate, "the cockroaches have been and gone
and eaten all our razors, they has, sir."Then, had you seen us reappear on deck after the terrible operation,
with our white shaven lips and shivering chins, and a foolish grin on
every face, you would, but for our uniform, have taken us for tailors on
strike, so unlike were we to the brave-looking, manly dare-devils that
trod the deck only an hour before.And if army officers and men have been graciously permitted to wear the
moustache since the Crimean war, why are not we?But perhaps the navy
took no part in that gallant struggle.But if we _must_ continue to do
penance by shaving, why should it not be the crown of the head, or any
other place, rather than the upper lip, which every one can see?One item of duty there is, which occasionally devolves on the medical
officer, and for the most part goes greatly against the feelings of the
_young_ surgeon; I refer to his compulsory attendance at floggings.It
is only fair to state that the majority of captains and commanders use
the cat as seldom as possible, and that, too, only sparingly.In some
ships, however, flogging is nearly as frequent as prayers of a morning.Again, it is more common on foreign stations than at home, and boys of
the first or second class, marines, and ordinary seamen, are for the
most part the victims.I do not believe I shall ever forget the first exhibition of this sort I
attended on board my own ship; not that the spectacle was in any way
more revolting than scores I have since witnessed, but because the sight
was new to me.I remember it wanted fully twenty minutes of seven in the morning, when
my servant aroused me."A flaying match, you know, sir," said Jones.My heart gave an anxious "thud" against my ribs, as if I myself were to
form the "ram for the sacrifice."I hurried through with my bath, and,
dressing myself as if for a holiday, in cocked hat, sword, and undress
coat, I went on deck.All the
minutiae of the scene I remember as though it were but yesterday,
morning was cool and clear, the hills clad in lilac and green, seabirds
floating high in air, and the waters of the bay reflecting the line of
the sky and the lofty mountain-sides, forming a picture almost dreamlike
in its quietness and serenity.The men were standing about in groups,
dressed in their whitest of pantaloons, bluest of smocks, and neatest of
black silk neckerchiefs.By-and-bye the culprit was led aft by a file
of marines, and I went below with him to make the preliminary
examination, in order to report whether or not he might be fit for the
punishment.He was as good a specimen of the British marine as one could wish to
look upon, hardy, bold, and wiry.His crime had been smuggling spirits
on board."Needn't examine me, Doctor," said he; "I ain't afeard of their four
dozen; they can't hurt me, sir,--leastways my back you know--my breast
though; hum-m!"and he shook his head, rather sadly I thought, as he
bent down his eyes."What," said I, "have you anything the matter with your chest?""Nay, Doctor, nay; its my feelins they'll hurt.I've a little girl at
home that loves me, and--bless you, sir, I won't look her in the face
again no-how."No lack of strength there, no nervousness; the artery
had the firm beat of health, the tendons felt like rods of iron beneath
the finger, and his biceps stood out hard and round as the mainstay of
an old seventy-four.I pitied the brave fellow, and--very wrong of me it was, but I could not
help it--filled out and offered him a large glass of rum.sir," he said, with a wistful eye on the ruby liquid, "don't tempt
me, sir.I can bear the bit o' flaying athout that: I wouldn't have my
messmates smell Dutch courage on my breath, sir; thankee all the same,
Doctor."All hands had already assembled, the men and boys on one side, and the
officers, in cocked hats and swords, on the other.A grating had been
lashed against the bulwark, and another placed on deck beside it.The
culprit's shoulders and back were bared, and a strong belt fastened
around the lower part of the loins for protection; he was then firmly
tied by the hands to the upper, and by the feet to the lower grating; a
little basin of cold water was placed at his feet; and all was now
prepared.The sentence was read, and orders given to proceed with the
punishment.The cat is a terrible instrument of torture; I would not
use it on a bull unless in self-defence: the shaft is about a foot and a
half long, and covered with green or red baize according to taste; the
thongs are nine, about twenty-eight inches in length, of the thickness
of a goose-quill, and with two knots tied on each.Men describe the
first blow as like a shower of molten lead.Combing out the thongs with his five fingers before each blow, firmly
and determinedly was the first dozen delivered by the bo'swain's mate,
and as unflinchingly received.Then, "One dozen, sir, please," he reported, saluting the commander."Continue the punishment," was the calm reply.Another dozen reported; again, the same reply.The flesh, like burning steel, had changed from red to
purple, and blue, and white; and between the third and fourth dozen, the
suffering wretch, pale enough now, and in all probability sick, begged a
comrade to give him a mouthful of water.There was a tear in the eye of
the hardy sailor who obeyed him, whispering as he did so--

"Keep up, Bill; it'll soon be over now.""Five, six," the corporal slowly counted--"seven, eight."It is the
last dozen, and how acute must be the torture!The blood
comes now fast enough, and--yes, gentle reader, I _will_ spare your
feelings.The man was cast loose at last and put on the sick-list; he
had borne his punishment without a groan and without moving a muscle.A
large pet monkey sat crunching nuts in the rigging, and grinning all the
time; I have no doubt _he_ enjoyed the spectacle immensely, _for he was
only an ape_.Tommie G--was a pretty, fair-skinned, blue-eyed boy, some sixteen
summers old.He was one of a class only too common in the service;
having become enamoured of the sea, he had run away from his home and
joined the service; and, poor little man!he found out, when too late,
that the stern realities of a sailor's life did not at all accord with
the golden notions he had formed of it.Being fond of stowing himself
away in corners with a book, instead of keeping his watch, Tommie very
often got into disgrace, spent much of his time at the mast-head, and
had many unpleasant palmar rencounters with the corporal's cane.One
day, his watch being over, he had retired to a corner with his little
"ditty-box."Nobody ever knew one-half of the beloved nicknacks and valued nothings
he kept in that wee box: it was in fact his private cabin, his sanctum
sanctorum, to which he could retreat when anything vexed him; a sort of
portable home, in which he could forget the toils of his weary watch,
the giddy mast-head, or even the corporal's cane.He had extracted, and
was dreamily gazing on, the portrait of a very young lady, when the
corporal came up and rudely seized it, and made a very rough and
inelegant remark concerning the fair virgin."That is my sister," cried Tommie, with tears in his eyes.sneered the corporal; "she is a--" and he added a word
that cannot be named.There was the spirit of young England, however,
in Tommie's breast; and the word had scarcely crossed the corporal's
lips, when those lips, and his nose too, were dyed in the blood the
boy's fist had drawn.For that blow poor Tommie was condemned to
receive four dozen lashes.And the execution of the sentence was
carried out with all the pomp and show usual on such occasions.Arrayed
in cooked-hats, epaulets, and swords, we all assembled to witness that
helpless child in his agony.One would have thought that even the rough
bo'swain's mate would have hesitated to disfigure skin so white and
tender, or that the frightened and imploring glance Tommie cast upward
on the first descending lash would have unnerved his arm.No,
reader; pity there doubtless was among us, but mercy--none.And the poor boy writhed in his agony; his screams and
cries were heartrending; and, God forgive us!we knew not till then he
was an orphan, till we heard him beseech his mother in heaven to look
down on her son, to pity and support him.well, perhaps she did,
for scarcely had the third dozen commenced when Tommie's cries were
hushed, his head drooped on his shoulder like a little dead bird's, and
for a while his sufferings were at an end.I gladly took the
opportunity to report further proceedings as dangerous, and he was
carried away to his hammock.I will not shock the nerves and feelings of the reader by any further
relation of the horrors of flogging, merely adding, that I consider
corporal punishment, as applied to men, _cowardly, cruel_, and debasing
to human nature; and as applied to boys, _brutal_, and sometimes even
_fiendish_.There is only one question I wish to ask of every
true-hearted English lady who may read these lines--Be you sister, wife,
or mother, could you in your heart have respected the commander who,
with folded arms and grim smile, replied to poor Tommie's frantic
appeals for mercy, "Continue the punishment"?The pay of medical officers is by no means high enough to entice young
doctors, who can do anything like well on shore, to enter the service.Ten shillings a day, with an increase of half-a-crown after five years'
service on full pay, is not a great temptation certainly.To be sure
the expenses of living are small, two shillings a day being all that is
paid for messing; this of course not including the wine-bill, the size
of which will depend on the "drouthiness" of the officer who contracts
it.Government provides all mess-traps, except silver forks and spoons.Then there is uniform to keep up, and shore-going clothes to be paid
for, and occasionally a shilling or two for boat-hire.However, with a
moderate wine-bill, the assistant-surgeon may save about four shillings
or more a day.Promotion to the rank of surgeon, unless to some fortunate individuals,
comes but slowly; it may, however, be reckoned on after from eight to
ten years.A few gentlemen out of each "batch" who "pass" into the
service, and who have distinguished themselves at the examination, are
promoted sooner.It seems to be the policy of the present Director-General to deal as
fairly as possible with every assistant-surgeon, after a certain
routine.On first joining he is sent for a short spell--too short,
indeed--to a hospital.He is then appointed to a sea-going ship for a
commission--say three years--on a foreign station.On coming home he is
granted a few months' leave on full pay, and is afterwards appointed to
a harbour-ship for about six months.By the end of this time he is
supposed to have fairly recruited from the fatigues of his commission
abroad; he is accordingly sent out again to some other foreign station
for three or four years.On again returning to his native land, he
might be justified in hoping for a pet appointment, say to a hospital,
the marines, a harbour-ship, or, failing these, to the Channel fleet.On being promoted he is sent off abroad again, and so on; and thus he
spends his useful life, and serves his Queen and country, and earns his
pay, and generally spends that likewise.Pensions are granted to the widows of assistant-surgeons--from forty to
seventy pounds a year, according to circumstances; and if he leaves no
widow, a dependent mother, or even sister, may obtain the pension.But
I fear I must give, to assistant-surgeons about to many, Punch's advice,
and say most emphatically, "Don't;" unless, indeed, the dear creature
has money, and is able to purchase a practice for her darling doctor.With a little increase of pay ungrudgingly given, shorter commissions
abroad, and less of the "bite and buffet" about favours granted, the
navy would be a very good service for the medical officer.However, as it is, to a man who has neither wife nor riches, it is, I
dare say, as good a way of spending life as any other; and I do think
that there are but few old surgeons who, on looking back to the life
they have led in the navy, would not say of that service,--"With all thy
faults I love thee still."After a great deal
of fighting and scrambling among themselves, during which the officer
got tugged here and tugged there a good many times, he was at last
bundled into a very dirty cobble, into which a rough-looking boatman
bounded after him and at once shoved off.The naval officer was myself--the reader's obsequious slave.As for the
boatman, one thing must be said in his favour, he seemed to be a person
of religious character--in one thing at least, for, on the Day of
Judgment, I, for one, will not be able to turn round and say to him "I
was a stranger and ye took me not in," for he did take me in.In fact,
Portsmouth, as a town, is rather particular on this point of
Christianity: they do take strangers in.asked the jolly waterman, leaning a moment on his oars."Be going for to join, I dessay, sir?""You are right," said I; "but have the goodness to pull so that I may
not be wet through on both sides.""I'll pay here," said I, "before we go alongside.""That's all, sir--distance is short you know.""Do you mean to say," said I, "that you really mean to charge--"

"Just three bob," interrupting me; "flag's up--can see for yourself,
sir.""The flag, you see--I mean my good man--don't tell me about a flag, I'm
too far north for you;" and I tried to look as northish as possible."Why, sir," said the man of oars, with a pitying expression of
countenance and voice, "flag means double fare--anybody'll tell you
that, sir."said I; "don't tell me that any one takes the trouble of
hoisting a flag in order to fill your confounded pockets; there is half
a crown, and not a penny more do you get from me.""Well, sir, o' condition you has me again, sir, you know, sir,--and my
name's McDonald;" and he pocketed the money, which I afterwards
discovered was a _leetle_ too much."McDonald," thought I--"my
grandmother's name; the rascal thinks to come round me by calling
himself a Scotchman--the idea of a McDonald being a waterman!""Sir," said I, aloud, "it is my unbiassed opinion and firm conviction
that you are--" I was going to add "a most unmitigated blackguard," but
I noticed that he was a man of six feet two, with breadth in proportion,
so I left the sentence unfinished.We were now within sight of the bristling sides of the old `Victory,' on
the quarter-deck of which fell the great and gallant Nelson in the hour
of battle and triumph; and I was a young officer about to join that
service which can boast of so many brave and noble men, and brave and
noble deeds; and one would naturally expect that I would indulge in a
few dreams of chivalry and romance, picture to myself a bright and
glorious future, pounds' weight of medals and crosses, including the
Victoria, kiss the hilt of my sword, and all that sort of thing.I was too wretchedly cold for one reason, and the only feeling I
had was one of shyness; as for duty, I knew I could and would do that,
as most of my countrymen had done before me; so I left castle-building
to the younger sons of noblemen or gentry, whose parents can afford to
allow them two or three hundred pounds a year to eke out their pay and
smooth the difficulties of the service.Not having been fortunate
enough to be born with even a horn spoon in my mouth, I had to be
content with my education as my fortune, and my navy pay as my only
income."Stabird side, I dessay, sir?""Certainly," said I, having a glimmering idea that it must be the proper
side.A few minutes after--"The Admiral's gig is going there, sir,--better
wait a bit."I looked on shore and _did_ see a gig, and two horses
attached to it."No," said I, "decidedly not, he can't see us here, man.I suppose you
want to go sticking your dirty wet oars in the air, do you?"--(I had
seen pictures of this performance)."Drive on, I mean pull ahead, my
hearty"--a phrase I had heard at the theatre, and considered highly
nautical.The waterman obeyed, and here is what came of it.We were just
approaching the ladder, when I suddenly became sensible of a rushing
noise.I have a dim recollection of seeing a long, many-oared boat,
carrying a large red flag, and with an old grey-haired officer sitting
astern; of hearing a voice--it might have belonged to the old man of the
sea, for anything I could have told to the contrary--float down the
wind,--

"Clear the way with that (something) bumboat!"Then came a crash, my
heels flew up--I had been sitting on the gunwale--and overboard I went
with a splash, just as some one else in the long boat sang out.there was a little too much way for me.When I came
to the surface of the water, I found myself several yards from the
ladder, and at once struck out for it.There was a great deal of noise
and shouting, and a sailor held towards me the sharp end of a boathook;
but I had no intention of being lugged out as if I were a pair of canvas
trowsers, and, calling to the sailor to keep his pole to himself--did he
want to knock my eye out?--I swam to the ladder and ascended.Thus then
I joined the service, and, having entered at the foot of the ladder, I
trust some day to find myself at the top of it.And, talking of joining the service, I here beg to repudiate, as an
utter fabrication, the anecdote--generally received as authentic in the
service--of the Scotch doctor, who, going to report himself for the
first time on board of the `Victory,' knocked at the door, and inquired
(at a marine, I think), "Is this the Royal Nauvy?--'cause I'm come till
jine."The story bears "fib" on the face of it, for there is not a
Scottish schoolboy but knows that one ship does not make a navy, any
more than one swallow does a summer.But, dear intending candidate, if you wish to do the right thing, array
yourself quietly in frock-coat, cap--not cocked hat, remember--and
sword, and go on board your ship in any boat you please, only keep out
of the way of gigs.When you arrive on board, don't be expecting to see
the admiral, because you'll be disappointed; but ask a sailor or marine
to point you out the midshipman of the watch, and request the latter to
show you the commander.Make this request civilly, mind you; do not
pull his ear, because, if big and hirsute, he might beat you, which
would be a bad beginning.When you meet the commander, don't rush up
and shake him by the hand, and begin talking about the weather; walk
respectfully up to him, and lift your cap as you would to a lady; upon
which he will hurriedly point to his nose with his forefinger, by way of
returning the salute, while at the same time you say--

"_Come_ on board, sir--to _join_, sir."It is the custom of the Service to make this remark in a firm, bold,
decided tone, placing the emphasis on the "_come_" to show clearly that
you _did come_, and that no one kicked, or dragged, or otherwise brought
you on board against your will.The proper intonation of the remark may
be learned from any polite waiter at a hotel, when he tells you,
"Dinner's ready, sir, please;" or it may be heard in the "Now then,
gents," of the railway guard of the period.Having reported yourself to the man of three stripes, you must not
expect that he will shake hands, or embrace you, ask you on shore to
tea, and introduce you to his wife.No, if he is good-natured, and has
not had a difference of opinion with the captain lately, he _may_
condescend to show you your cabin and introduce you to your messmates;
but if he is out of temper, he will merely ask your name, and, on your
telling him, remark, "Humph!"then call the most minute midshipman to
conduct you to your cabin, being at the same time almost certain to
mispronounce your name.Say your name is Struthers, he will call you
Stutters."Here, Mr Pigmy, conduct Mr Stutters to his cabin, and show him where
the gunroom--ah!I beg his pardon, the wardroom--lies.""Ay, ay, sir," says the middy, and skips off at a round trot, obliging
you either to adopt the same ungraceful mode of progression, or lose
sight of him altogether, and have to wander about, feeling very much
from home, until some officer passing takes pity on you and leads you to
the wardroom.It is a way they have in the service, or rather it is the custom of the
present Director-General, not to appoint the newly-entered medical
officer at once to a sea-going ship, but instead to one or other of the
naval hospitals for a few weeks or even months, in order that he may be
put up to the ropes, as the saying is, or duly initiated into the
mysteries of service and routine of duty.This is certainly a good
idea, although it is a question whether it would not be better to adopt
the plan they have at Netley, and thus put the navy and army on the same
footing.Haslar Hospital at Portsmouth is a great rambling barrack-looking block
of brick building, with a yard or square surrounded by high walls in
front, and with two wings extending from behind, which, with the chapel
between, form another and smaller square.There are seldom fewer than a thousand patients within, and, independent
of a whole regiment of male and female nurses, sick-bay-men, servants,
cooks, _et id genus omne_, there is a regular staff of officers,
consisting of a captain--of what use I have yet to learn--two medical
inspector-generals, generally three or four surgeons, the same number of
regularly appointed assistant-surgeons, besides from ten to twenty
acting assistant-surgeons [Note 1] waiting for appointments, and doing
duty as supernumeraries.Of this last class I myself was a member.Soon as the clock tolled the hour of eight in the morning, the
staff-surgeon of our side of the hospital stalked into the duty cabin,
where we, the assistants, were waiting to receive him.Immediately
after, we set out on the morning visit, each of us armed with a little
board or palette to be used as a writing-desk, an excise inkstand slung
in a buttonhole, and a quill behind the ear.The large doors were
thrown open, the beds neat and tidy, and the nurses "standing by."Up
each side of the long wards, from bed to bed, we journeyed; notifying
the progress of each case, repeating the treatment here, altering or
suspending it there, and performing small operations in another place;
listening attentively to tales of aches and pains, and hopes and fears,
and just in a sort of general way acting the part of good Samaritans.From one ward to another we went, up and down long staircases, along
lengthy corridors, into wards in the attics, into wards on the basement,
and into wards below ground,--fracture wards, Lazarus wards, erysipelas
wards, men's wards, officers' wards; and thus we spent the time till a
little past nine, by which time the relief of so much suffering had
given us an appetite, and we hurried off to the messroom to breakfast.The medical mess at Haslar is one of the finest in the service.Attached to the room is a nice little apartment, fitted up with a
bagatelle-table, and boxing gloves and foils _ad libitum_.And, sure
enough, you might walk many a weary mile, or sail many a knot, without
meeting twenty such happy faces as every evening surrounded our
dinner-table, without beholding twenty such bumper glasses raised at
once to the toast of Her Majesty the Queen, and without hearing twenty
such good songs, or five times twenty such yarns and original bons-mots,
as you would at Haslar Medical Mess.Yet I must confess we partook in
but a small degree indeed of the solemn quietude of Wordsworth's--

  "--Party in a parlour cramm'd,
  Some sipping punch, some sipping tea,
  But, as you by their faces see,
  All silent--and all damned."I do not deny that we were a little noisy at times, and that on several
occasions, having eaten and drunken till we were filled, we rose up to
dance, and consequently received a _polite_ message from the inspector
whose house was adjoining, requesting us to "stop our _confounded_ row;"
but then the old man was married, and no doubt his wife was at the
bottom of it.Duty was a thing that did not fall to the lot of us supers every day.We took it turn about, and hard enough work it used to be too.As soon
as breakfast was over, the medical officer on duty would hie him away to
the receiving-room, and seat himself at the large desk; and by-and-bye
the cases would begin to pour in.First there would arrive, say three
or four blue-jackets, with their bags under their arms, in charge of an
assistant-surgeon, then a squad of marines, then more blue-jackets, then
more red-coats, and so the game of _rouge-et-noir_ would go on during
the day.The officer on duty has first to judge whether or not the case
is one that can be admitted,--that is, which cannot be conveniently
treated on board; he has then to appoint the patient a bed in a proper
ward, and prescribe for him, almost invariably a bath and a couple of
pills.Besides, he has to enter the previous history of the case,
verbatim, into each patient's case-book, and if the cases are numerous,
and the assistant-surgeon who brings them has written an elaborate
account of each disease, the duty-officer will have had his work cut out
for him till dinner-time at least.Before the hour of the patient's
dinner, this gentleman has also to glance into each ward, to see if
everything is right, and if there are any complaints.Even when ten or
eleven o'clock at night brings sleep and repose to others, his work is
not yet over; he has one other visit to pay any time during the night
through all his wards.Then with dark-lantern and slippers you may meet
him, gliding ghost-like along the corridors or passages, lingering at
ward doors, listening on the staircases, smelling and snuffing, peeping
and keeking, and endeavouring by eye, or ear, or nose, to detect the
slightest irregularity among the patients or nurses, such as burning
lights without orders, gambling by the light of the fire, or smoking.This visit paid, he may return to his virtuous cabin, and sleep as
soundly as he chooses.Very few of the old surgeons interfere with the duties of their
assistants, but there _be_ men who seem to think you have merely come to
the service to learn, not to practise your profession, and therefore
they treat you as mere students, or at the best hobble-de-hoy doctors.Of this class was Dr Gruff, a man whom I would back against the whole
profession for caudle, clyster, castor-oil, or linseed poultice; but
who, I rather suspect, never prescribed a dose of chiretta, santonin, or
lithia-water in his life.He came to me one duty-day, in a great hurry,
and so much excited that I judged he had received some grievous bodily
ailment, or suffered some severe family bereavement."Well, sir," he cried; "I hear, sir, you have put a case of ulcer into
the erysipelas ward."This remark, not partaking of the nature of question, I thought required
no answer."Is it true, sir?--is it true?""It is, sir," was the reply."And what do you mean by it, sir?he
exclaimed, waxing more and more wroth."I thought, sir--" I began."Yes, sir," continued I, my Highland blood getting uppermost, "I _did_
think that, the case being one of ulcer of an _erysipelatous_ nature, I
was--"

"Erysipelatous ulcer!"said he, "that alters the
case.I beg your pardon;" and he
trotted off again."All right," thought I, "old Gruff.But although there are not wanting medical officers in the service who,
on being promoted to staff-surgeon, appear to forget that ever they wore
less than three stripes, and can keep company with no one under the rank
of commander, I am happy to say they are few and far between, and every
year getting more few and farther between.It is a fine thing to be appointed for, say three or four years to a
home hospital; in fact, it is the assistant-surgeon's highest ambition.Next, in point of comfort, would be an appointment at the Naval Hospital
of Malta, Cape of Good Hope, or China.The acting assistant-surgeons are those who have not as yet
served the probationary year, or been confirmed.They are liable to be
dismissed without a court-martial.A STORM IN BISCAY BAY.A WORD ON BASS'S BEER.For the space of six weeks I lived in clover at Haslar, and at the end
of that time my appointment to a sea-going ship came.It was the
pleasure of their Lordships the Commissioners, that I should take my
passage to the Cape of Good Hope in a frigate, which had lately been put
in commission and was soon about to sail.Arrived there, I was to be
handed over to the flag-ship on that station for disposal, like so many
stones of salt pork.On first entering the service every medical
officer is sent for one commission (three to five years) to a foreign
station; and it is certainly very proper too that the youngest and
strongest men, rather than the oldest, should do the rough work of the
service, and go to the most unhealthy stations.The frigate in which I was ordered passage was to sail from Plymouth.To that town I was accordingly sent by train, and found the good ship in
such a state of internal chaos--painters, carpenters, sail-makers, and
sailors; armourers, blacksmiths, gunners, and tailors; every one engaged
at his own trade, with such an utter disregard of order or regularity,
while the decks were in such confusion, littered with tools, nails,
shavings, ropes, and spars, among which I scrambled, and over which I
tumbled, getting into everybody's way, and finding so little rest for
the sole of my foot, that I was fain to beg a week's leave, and glad
when I obtained it.On going on board again at the end of that time, a
very different appearance presented itself; everything was in its proper
place, order and regularity were everywhere.The decks were white and
clean, the binnacles, the brass and mahogany work polished, the gear all
taut, the ropes coiled, and the vessel herself sitting on the water
saucy as the queen of ducks, with her pennant flying and her beautiful
ensign floating gracefully astern.The gallant ship was ready for sea,
had been unmoored, had made her trial trips, and was now anchored in the
Sound.From early morning to busy noon, and from noon till night, boats
glided backwards and forwards between the ship and the shore, filled
with the friends of those on board, or laden with wardroom and gunroom
stores.Among these might have been seen a shore-boat, rowed by two
sturdy watermen, and having on board a large sea-chest, with a naval
officer on top of it, grasping firmly a Cremona in one hand and holding
a hat-box in the other.The boat was filled with any number of smaller
packages, among which were two black portmanteaus, warranted to be the
best of leather, and containing the gentleman's dress and undress
uniforms; these, however, turned out to be mere painted pasteboard, and
in a very few months the cockroaches--careless, merry-hearted
creatures--after eating up every morsel of them, turned their attention
to the contents, on which they dined and supped for many days, till the
officer's dress-coat was like a meal-sieve, and his pantaloons might
have been conveniently need for a landing-net.This, however, was a
matter of small consequence, for, contrary to the reiterated assurance
of his feline friend, no one portion of this officer's uniform held out
for a longer period than six months, the introduction of any part of his
person into the corresponding portion of his raiment having become a
matter of matutinal anxiety and distress, lest a solution of continuity
in the garment might be the unfortunate result.About six o'clock on a beautiful Wednesday evening, early in the month
of May, our gallant and saucy frigate turned her bows seaward and slowly
steamed away from amidst the fleet of little boats that--crowded with
the unhappy wives and sweethearts of the sailors--had hung around us all
the afternoon.Puffing and blowing a great deal, and apparently panting
to be out and away at sea, the good ship nevertheless left her anchorage
but slowly, and withal reluctantly, her tears falling thick and fast on
the quarter-deck as she went.The band was playing a slow and mournful air, by way of keeping up our
spirits._I_ had no friends to say farewell to, there was no tear-bedimmed eye to
gaze after me until I faded in distance; so I stood on the poop, leaning
over the bulwarks, after the fashion of Vanderdecken, captain of the
Flying Dutchman, and equally sad and sorrowful-looking.And what did I
see from my elevated situation?A moving picture, a living panorama; a
bright sky sprinkled with a few fleecy cloudlets, over a blue sea all in
motion before a fresh breeze of wind; a fleet of little boats astern,
filled with picturesquely dressed seamen and women waving handkerchiefs;
the long breakwater lined with a dense crowd of sorrowing friends, each
anxious to gain one last look of the dear face he may never see more.Yonder is the grey-haired father, yonder the widowed mother, the
affectionate brother, the loving sister, the fond wife, the beloved
sweetheart,--all are there; and not a sigh that is sighed, not a tear
that is shed, not a prayer that is breathed, but finds a response in the
bosom of some loved one on board.To the right are green hills,
people-clad likewise, while away in the distance the steeple of many a
church "points the way to happier spheres," and on the flagstaff at the
port-admiral's house is floating the signal "Fare thee well."The band has ceased to play, the sailors have given their last ringing
cheer, even the echoes of which have died away, and faintly down the
wind comes the sound of the evening bells.The men are gathered in
little groups on deck, and there is a tenderness in their landward gaze,
and a pathos in their rough voices, that one would hardly expect to
find."Yonder's my Poll, Jack," says one.the poor lass is
crying; blowed if I think I'll ever see her more.""There," says another, "is _my_ old girl on the breakwater, beside the
old cove in the red nightcap.""That's my father, Bill," answers a third."God bless the dear old
chap?""Good-bye, Jean; good-bye, lass.Blessed if I
don't feel as if I could make a big baby of myself and cry outright."Dick, Dick," exclaims an honest-looking tar; "I see'd my poor wife
tumble down; she had wee Johnnie in her arms, and--and what will I do?""Keep up your heart, to be sure," answers a tall, rough son of a gun."There, she has righted again, only a bit of a swoon ye see.I've got
neither sister, wife, nor mother, so surely it's _me_ that ought to be
making a noodle of myself; but where's the use?"An hour or two later we were steaming across channel, with nothing
visible but the blue sea all before us, and the chalky cliffs of
Cornwall far behind, with the rosy blush of the setting sun lingering on
their summits.Then the light faded from the sky, the gloaming star shone out in the
east, big waves began to tumble in, and the night breeze blew cold and
chill from off the broad Atlantic Ocean.Tired and dull, weary and sad, I went below to the wardroom and seated
myself on a rocking chair.It was now that I began to feel the
discomfort of not having a cabin.Being merely a supernumerary or
passenger, such a luxury was of course out of the question, even had I
been an admiral.I was to have a screen berth, or what a landsman would
call a canvas tent, on the main or fighting deck, but as yet it was not
rigged.Had I never been to sea before, I would have now felt very
wretched indeed; but having roughed it in Greenland and Davis Straits in
small whaling brigs, I had got over the weakness of sea-sickness; yet
notwithstanding I felt all the thorough prostration both of mind and
body, which the first twenty-four hours at sea often produces in the
oldest and best of sailors, so that I was only too happy when I at last
found myself within canvas.By next morning the wind had freshened, and when I turned out I found
that the steam had been turned off, and that we were bowling along
before a ten-knot breeze.All that day the wind blew strongly from the
N.N.E., and increased as night came on to a regular gale of wind.I had
seen some wild weather in the Greenland Ocean, but never anything
before, nor since, to equal the violence of the storm on that dreadful
night, in the Bay of Biscay.We were running dead before the wind at
twelve o'clock, when the gale was at its worst, and when the order to
light fires and get up steam had been given.Just then we were making
fourteen knots, with only a foresail, a fore-topsail, and main-topsail,
the latter two close-reefed.I was awakened by a terrific noise on
deck, and I shall not soon forget that awakening.The ship was leaking
badly both at the ports and scupper-holes; so that the maindeck all
around was flooded with water, which lifted my big chest every time the
roll of the vessel allowed it to flow towards it.To say the ship was
rolling would express but poorly the indescribably disagreeable
wallowing motion of the frigate, while men were staggering with anxious
faces from gun to gun, seeing that the lashings were all secure; so
great was the strain on the cable-like ropes that kept them in their
places.The shot had got loose from the racks, and were having a small
cannonade on their own account, to the no small consternation of the men
whose duty it was to re-secure them.It was literally sea without and
sea within, for the green waves were pouring down the main hatchway,
adding to the amount of water already _below_, where the chairs and
other articles of domestic utility were all afloat and making voyages of
discovery from one officer's cabin to another.On the upper deck all was darkness, confusion, and danger, for both the
fore and main-topsails had been carried away at the same time, reducing
us to one sail--the foresail.The noise and crackling of the riven
canvas, mingling with the continuous roar of the storm, were at times
increased by the rattle of thunder and the rush of rain-drops, while the
lightning played continually around the slippery masts and cordage.About one o'clock, a large ship, apparently unmanageable, was dimly seen
for one moment close aboard of us--had we come into collision the
consequences must have been dreadful;--and thus for two long hours,
_till steam was got up_, did we fly before the gale, after which the
danger was comparatively small.Having spent its fury, having in fact blown itself out of breath, the
wind next day retired to its cave, and the waves got smaller and
beautifully less, till peace and quietness once more reigned around us.Going on deck one morning I found we were anchored under the very shadow
of a steep rock, and not far from a pretty little town at the foot of a
high mountain, which was itself covered to the top with trees and
verdure, with the white walls of many a quaint-looking edifice peeping
through the green--boats, laden with fruit and fish and turtle,
surrounded the ship.The island of Madeira and town, of Funchal.As
there was no pier, we had to land among the stones.The principal
amusement of English residents here seems to be lounging about, cheroot
in mouth, beneath the rows of trees that droop over the pavements,
getting carried about in portable hammocks, and walking or riding (I
rode, and, not being able to get my horse to move at a suitable pace, I
looked behind, and found the boy from whom I had hired him sticking like
a leech to my animal's tail, nor would he be shaken off--nor could the
horse be induced to kick him off; this is the custom of the Funchalites,
and a funny one it is) to the top of the mountain, for the pleasure of
coming down in a sleigh, a distance of two miles, in twice as many
minutes, while the least deviation from the path would result in a
terrible smash against the wall of either side, but I never heard of any
such accident occurring.Three days at Madeira, and up anchor again; our next place of call being
Saint Helena.Every one has heard of the gentleman who wanted to
conquer the world but couldn't, who tried to beat the British but
didn't, who staked his last crown at a game of _loo_, and losing fled,
and fleeing was chased, and being chased was caught and chained by the
leg, like an obstreperous game-cock, to a rock somewhere in the middle
of the sea, on which he stood night and day for years, with his arms
folded across his chest, and his cocked hat wrong on, a warning to the
unco-ambitious.The rock was Saint Helena, and a very beautiful rock it
is too, hill and dell and thriving town, its mountain-sides tilled and
its straths and glens containing many a fertile little farm.It is the
duty of every one who touches the shores of this far-famed island to
make a pilgrimage to Longwood, the burial-place of the "great man."I
have no intention of describing this pilgrimage, for this has been done
by dozens before my time, or, if not, it ought to have been: I shall
merely add a very noticeable fact, which others may not perchance have
observed--_both sides_ of the road all the way to the tomb are strewn
with _Bass's beer-bottles_, empty of course, and at the grave itself
there are hogsheads of them; and the same is the case at every place
which John Bull has visited, or where English foot has ever trodden.The rule holds good all over the world; and in the Indian Ocean,
whenever I found an uninhabited island, or even reef which at some
future day would be an island, if I did not likewise find an empty
beer-bottle, I at once took possession in the name of Queen Victoria,
giving three hips!thrice, and singing "For he's a jolly
good fellow," without any very distinct notion as to who _was_ the jolly
fellow; also adding more decidedly "which nobody can deny"--there being
no one on the island to deny it.England has in this way acquired much additional territory at my hands,
without my having as yet received any very substantial recompense for my
services.THE MODERN RODERICK RANDOM.The duties of the assistant-surgeon--the modern Roderick Random--on
board a line-of-battle ship are seldom very onerous in time of peace,
and often not worth mentioning.Suppose, for example, the reader is
that officer.At five bells--half-past six--in the morning, if you
happen to be a light sleeper, you will be sensible of some one gliding
silently into your cabin, rifling your pockets, and extracting your
watch, your money, and other your trinkets; but do not jump out of bed,
pray, with the intention of collaring him; it is no thief--only your
servant.Formerly this official used to be a marine, with whom on
joining your ship you bargained in the following manner.The marine walked up to you and touched his front hair, saying at the
same time,--

"_I_ don't mind looking arter you, sir," or "I'll do for you, sir."On
which you would reply,--

"All right!and he would answer "Cheeks," or whatever
his name might be.(Cheeks, that is the real Cheeks, being a sort of
visionary soldier--a phantom marine--and very useful at times, answering
in fact to the Nobody of higher quarters, who is to blame for so many
things,--"Nobody is to blame," and "Cheeks is to blame," being
synonymous sentences.)Now-a-days Government kindly allows each commissioned officer one half
of a servant, or one whole one between two officers, which, at times, is
found to be rather an awkward arrangement; as, for instance, you and,
say, the lieutenant of marines, have each the half of the same servant,
and you wish your half to go on shore with a message, and the lieutenant
requires his half to remain on board: the question then comes to be one
which only the wisdom of Solomon could solve, in the same way that
Alexander the Great loosed the Gordian knot.Your servant, then, on entering your cabin in the morning, carefully and
quietly deposits the contents of your pockets on your table, and, taking
all your clothes and your boots in his arms, silently flits from view,
and shortly after re-enters, having in the interval neatly folded and
brushed them.You are just turning round to go to sleep again, when--

"Six bells, sir, please," remarks your man, laying his hand on your
elbow, and giving you a gentle shake to insure your resuscitation, and
which will generally have the effect of causing you to spring at once
from your cot, perhaps in your hurry nearly upsetting the cup of
delicious ship's cocoa which he has kindly saved to you from his own
breakfast--a no small sacrifice either, if you bear in mind that his own
allowance is by no means very large, and that his breakfast consists of
cocoa and biscuits alone--these last too often containing more weevils
than flour.As you hurry into your bath, your servant coolly informs
you--

"Plenty of time, sir."Then," you inquire, "it isn't six bells?""Not a bit on it, sir," he replies; "wants the quarter."At seven o'clock exactly you make your way forward to the sick-bay, on
the lower deck at the ship's bows.Now, this making your way forward
isn't by any means such an easy task as one might imagine; for at that
hour the deck is swarming with the men at their toilet, stripped to the
waist, every man at his tub, lathering, splashing, scrubbing and
rubbing, talking, laughing, joking, singing, sweating, and swearing.Finding your way obstructed, you venture to touch one mildly on the bare
back, as a hint to move aside and let you pass; the man immediately
damns your eyes, then begs pardon, and says he thought it was Bill "at
his lark again."Another who is bending down over his tub you touch
more firmly on the _os innominatum_, and ask him in a free and easy sort
of tone to "slue round there."He "slues round," very quickly too, but
unfortunately in the wrong direction, and ten to one capsizes you in a
tub of dirty soapsuds.Having picked yourself up, you pursue your
journey, and sing out as a general sort of warning--

For the benefit of those happy individuals who never saw, or had to eat,
weevils, I may here state that they are small beetles of the exact size
and shape of the common woodlouse, and that the taste is rather insipid,
with a slight flavour of boiled beans.Never have tasted the woodlouse,
but should think the flavour would be quite similar."Gangway there, lads," which causes at least a dozen of these worthies
to pass such ironical remarks to their companions as--

"Out of the doctor's way there, Tom.""Let the gentleman pass, can't you, Jack?""Port your helm, Mat; the doctor wants you to.""Round with your stern, Bill; the surgeon's _mate_ is a passing.""Kick that donkey Jones out of the doctor's road,"--while at the same
time it is always the speaker himself who is in the way.At last, however, you reach the sick-bay in safety, and retire within
the screen.Here, if a strict service man, you will find the surgeon
already seated; and presently the other assistant enters, and the work
is begun.There is a sick-bay man, or dispenser, and a sick-bay cook,
attached to the medical department.The surgeon generally does the
brain-work, and the assistants the finger-work; and, to their shame be
it spoken, there are some surgeons too proud to consult their younger
brethren, whom they treat as assistant-drudges, not assistant-surgeons.At eight o'clock--before or after,--the work is over, and you are off to
breakfast.At nine o'clock the drum beats, when every one, not otherwise engaged,
is required to muster on the quarter-deck, every officer as he comes up
lifting his cap, not to the captain, but to the Queen.After inspection
the parson reads prayers; you are then free to write, or read, or
anything else in reason you choose; and, if in harbour, you may go on
shore--boats leaving the ship at regular hours for the convenience of
the officers--always premising that one medical man be left on board, in
case of accident.In most foreign ports where a ship may be lying,
there is no want of both pleasure and excitement on shore.Take for
example the little town of Simon's, about twenty miles from Cape Town,
with a population of not less than four thousand of Englishmen, Dutch,
Malays, Caffres, and Hottentots.The bay is large, and almost
landlocked.The little white town is built along the foot of a lofty
mountain.Beautiful walks can be had in every direction, along the hard
sandy sea-beach, over the mountains and on to extensive table-lands, or
away up into dark rocky dingles and heath-clad glens.Nothing can
surpass the beauty of the scenery, or the gorgeous loveliness of the
wild heaths and geraniums everywhere abounding.There is a good hotel
and billiard-room; and you can shoot where, when, and what you please--
monkeys, pigeons, rock rabbits, wild ducks, or cobra-di-capellas.If
you long for more society, or want to see life, get a day or two days'
leave.Rise at five o'clock; the morning will be lovely and clear, with
the mist rising from its flowery bed on the mountain's brow, and the
sun, large and red, entering on a sky to which nor pen nor pencil could
do justice.The cart is waiting for you at the hotel, with an awning
spread above.Jump in: crack goes the long Caffre whip; away with a
plunge and a jerk go the three pairs of Caffre horses, and along the
sea-shore you dash, with the cool sea-breeze in your face, and the
water, green and clear, rippling up over the horses' feet; then, amid
such scenery, with such exhilarating weather, in such a life-giving
climate, if you don't feel a glow of pleasure that will send the blood
tingling through your veins, from the points of your ten toes to the
extreme end of your eyelashes, there must be something radically and
constitutionally wrong with you, and the sooner you go on board and dose
yourself with calomel and jalap the better.Arrived at Cape Town, a few introductions will simply throw the whole
city at your command, and all it contains.I do not intend this as a complete sketch of your trip, or I would have
mentioned some of the many beautiful spots and places of interest you
pass on the road--Rathfeldas for example, a hotel halfway, a house
buried in sweetness; and the country round about, with its dark waving
forests, its fruitful fields and wide-spreading vineyards, where the
grape seems to grow almost without cultivation; its comfortable
farm-houses; and above all its people, kind, generous, and hospitable as
the country is prolific.So you see, dear reader, a navy surgeon's life hath its pleasures.and sorry I am to add, its sufferings too; for a few
pages farther on the picture must change: if we get the lights we must
needs take the shadows also.ENEMY ON THE PORT BOW.We will suppose that the reader still occupies the position of
assistant-surgeon in a crack frigate or saucy line-of-battle ship.If
you go on shore for a walk in the forenoon you may return to lunch at
twelve; or if you have extended your ramble far into the country, or
gone to visit a friend or lady-love--though for the latter the gloaming
hour is to be preferred--you will in all probability have succeeded in
establishing an appetite by half-past five, when the officers'
dinner-boat leaves the pier.Now, I believe there are few people in the world to whom a good dinner
does not prove an attraction, and this is what in a large ship one is
always pretty sure of, more especially on guest-nights, which are
evenings set apart--one every week--for the entertainment of the
officers' friends, one or more of whom any officer may invite, by
previously letting the mess-caterer know of his intention.The
mess-caterer is the officer who has been elected to superintend the
victualling, as the wine-caterer does the liquor department, and a
by-no-means-enviable position it is, and consequently it is for ever
changing hands.Sailors are proverbial growlers, and, indeed, a certain
amount of growling is, and ought to be, permitted in every mess; but it
is scarcely fair for an officer, because his breakfast does not please
him, or if he can't get butter to his cheese after dinner, to launch
forth his indignation at the poor mess-caterer, who most likely is doing
all he can to please.These growlers too never speak right out or
directly to the point.It is all under-the-table stabbing."Such and such a ship that I was in," says growler first, "and such and
such a mess--"

"Oh, by George!"says growler second, "_I_ knew that ship; that was a
mess, and no mistake?""Why, yes," replies number one, "the lunch we got there was better than
the dinner we have in this old clothes-basket."On guest-nights your friend sits beside yourself, of course, and you
attend to his corporeal wants.One of the nicest things about the
service, in my opinion, is the having the band every day at dinner; then
too everything is so orderly; with our president and vice-president, it
is quite like a pleasure party every evening; so that altogether the
dinner, while in harbour, comes to be the great event of the day.And
after the cloth has been removed, and the president, with a preliminary
rap on the table to draw attention, has given the only toast of the
evening, the Queen, and due honour has been paid thereto, and the
bandmaster, who has been keeking in at the door every minute for the
last ten, that he might not make a mistake in the time, has played "God
save the Queen," and returned again to waltzes, quadrilles, or
selections from operas,--then it is very pleasant and delightful to loll
over our walnuts and wine, and half-dream away the half-hour till coffee
is served.Then, to be sure, that little cigar in our canvas
smoking-room outside the wardroom door, though the last, is by no means
the least pleasant part of the _dejeuner_.For my own part, I enjoy the
succeeding hour or so as much as any: when, reclining in an easy chair,
in a quiet corner, I can sip my tea, and enjoy my favourite author to my
heart's content.You must spare half an hour, however, to pay your last
visit to the sick; but this will only tend to make you appreciate your
ease all the more when you have done.So the evening wears away, and by
ten o'clock you will probably just be sufficiently tired to enjoy
thoroughly your little swing-cot and your cool white sheets.At sea, luncheon, or tiffin, is dispensed with, and you dine at
half-past two.Not much difference in the quality of viands after all,
for now-a-days everything worth eating can be procured, in hermetically
sealed tins, capable of remaining fresh for any length of time.There is one little bit of the routine of the service, which at first
one may consider a hardship.You are probably enjoying your deepest, sweetest sleep, rocked in the
cradle of the deep, and gently swaying to and fro in your little cot;
you had turned in with the delicious consciousness of safety, for well
you knew that the ship was far away at sea, far from rock or reef or
deadly shoal, and that the night was clear and collision very
improbable, so you are slumbering like a babe on its mother's breast--as
you are for that matter--for the second night-watch is half spent; when,
mingling confusedly with your dreams, comes the roll of the drum; you
start and listen.There is a moment's pause, when birr-r-r-r it goes
again, and as you spring from your couch you hear it the third time.And now you can distinguish the shouts of officers and petty officers,
high over the din of the trampling of many feet, of the battening down
of hatches, of the unmooring of great guns, and of heavy ropes and bars
falling on the deck: then succeeds a dead silence, soon broken by the
voice of the commander thundering, "Enemy on the port bow;" and then,
and not till then, do you know it is no real engagement, but the monthly
night-quarters.And you can't help feeling sorry there isn't a real
enemy on the port bow, or either bow, as you hurry away to the cockpit,
with the guns rattling all the while overhead, as if a real live
thunderstorm were being taken on board, and was objecting to be stowed
away.So you lay out your instruments, your sponges, your bottles of
wine, and your buckets of water, and, seating yourself in the midst,
begin to read `Midsummer Night's Dream,' ready at a moment's notice to
amputate the leg of any man on board, whether captain, cook, or
cabin-boy.Another nice little amusement the officer of the watch may give himself
on fine clear nights is to set fire to and let go the lifebuoy, at the
same time singing out at the top of his voice, "Man overboard."A boatswain's mate at once repeats the call, and vociferates down the
main hatchway, "Life-boat's crew a-ho-oy!"In our navy a few short but expressive moments of silence ever precede
the battle, that both officers and men may hold communion with their
God.The men belonging to this boat, who have been lying here and there
asleep but dressed, quickly tumble up the ladder pell-mell; there is a
rattling of oars heard, and the creaking of pulleys, then a splash in
the water alongside, the boat darts away from the ship like an arrow
from a bow, and the crew, rowing towards the blazing buoy, save the life
of the unhappy man, Cheeks the marine.And thus do British sailors rule the waves and keep old Neptune in his
own place.CONTAINING--IF NOT THE WHOLE--NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.If the disposing, in the service, of even a ship-load of
assistant-surgeons, is considered a matter of small moment, my disposal,
after reaching the Cape of Good Hope, needs but small comment.I was
very soon appointed to take charge of a gunboat, in lieu of a gentleman
who was sent to the Naval Hospital of Simon's Town, to fill a death
vacancy--for the navy as well as nature abhors a vacuum.I had seen the
bright side of the service, I was now to have my turn of the dark; I had
enjoyed life on board a crack frigate, I was now to rough it in a
gunboat.The east coast of Africa was to be our cruising ground, and our ship a
pigmy steamer, with plenty fore-and-aft about her, but nothing else; in
fact, she was Euclid's definition of a line to a t, length without
breadth, and small enough to have done "excellently well" as a Gravesend
tug-boat.Her teeth were five: namely, one gigantic cannon, a
65-pounder, as front tooth; on each side a brass howitzer; and flanking
these, two canine tusks in shape of a couple of 12-pounder Armstrongs.With this armament we were to lord it with a high hand over the Indian
Ocean; carry fire and sword, or, failing sword, the cutlass, into the
very heart of slavery's dominions; the Arabs should tremble at the roar
of our guns and the thunder of our bursting shells, while the slaves
should clank their chains in joyful anticipation of our coming; and best
of all, we--the officers--should fill our pockets with prize-money to
spend when we again reached the shores of merry England.Unfortunately,
this last premeditation was the only one which sustained disappointment,
for, our little craft being tender to the flag-ship of the station, all
our hard-earned prize-money had to be equally shared with her officers
and crew, which reduced the shares to fewer pence each than they
otherwise would have been pounds, and which was a burning shame.It was the Cape winter when I joined the gunboat.The hills were
covered with purple and green, the air was deliciously cool, and the
far-away mountain-tops were clad in virgin snow.It was twelve o'clock
noon when I took my traps on board, and found my new messmates seated
around the table at tiffin.The gunroom, called the wardroom by
courtesy--for the after cabin was occupied by the lieutenant
commanding--was a little morsel of an apartment, which the table and
five cane-bottomed chairs entirely filled.The officers were five--
namely, a little round-faced, dimple-cheeked, good-natured fellow, who
was our second-master; a tall and rather awkward-looking young
gentleman, our midshipman; a lean, pert, and withal diminutive youth,
brimful of his own importance, our assistant-paymaster; a fair-haired,
bright-eyed, laughing boy from Cornwall, our sub-lieutenant; and a "wee
wee man," dapper, clean, and tidy, our engineer, admitted to this mess
because he was so thorough an exception to his class, which is
celebrated more for the unctuosity of its outer than for the smoothness
of its inner man."Come along, old fellow," said our navigator, addressing me as I entered
the messroom, bobbing and bowing to evade fracture of the cranium by
coming into collision with the transverse beams of the deck above--"come
along and join us, we don't dine till four.""And precious little to dine upon," said the officer on his right."Steward, let us have the rum," [Note 1] cried the first speaker.And thus addressed, the steward shuffled in, bearing in his hand a black
bottle, and apparently in imminent danger of choking himself on a large
mouthful of bread and butter.This functionary's dress was remarkable
rather for its simplicity than its purity, consisting merely of a pair
of dirty canvas pants, a pair of purser's shoes--innocent as yet of
blacking--and a greasy flannel shirt.But, indeed, uniform seemed to be
the exception, and not the rule, of the mess, for, while one wore a blue
serge jacket, another was arrayed in white linen, and the rest had
neither jacket nor vest.The table was guiltless of a cloth, and littered with beer-bottles,
biscuits, onions, sardines, and pats of butter.exclaimed the sub-lieutenant; "that beggar
Dawson is having his own whack o' grog and everybody else's."I'll have _my_ tot to-day, I know," said the
assistant-paymaster, snatching the bottle from Dawson, and helping
himself to a very liberal allowance of the ruby fluid.cried the midshipman, snatching the
glass from the table and bolting the contents at a gulp, adding, with a
gasp of satisfaction as he put down the empty tumbler, "The chap thinks
nobody's got a soul to be saved but himself.""Soul or no soul," replied the youthful man of money as he gazed
disconsolately at the empty glass, "my _spirit's_ gone.""Blessed," said the engineer, shaking the black bottle, "if you devils
have left me a drain!see if I don't look out for A1 to-morrow."And they all said "Where is the doctor's?""See if that beggarly bumboat-man is alongside, and get me another pat
of butter and some soft tack; get the grub first, then tell him I'll pay
to-morrow."These and such like scraps of conversation began to give me a little
insight into the kind of mess I had joined and the character of my
future messmates."Steward," said I, "show me my cabin."He did so;
indeed, he hadn't far to go.It was the aftermost, and consequently the
smallest, although I _ought_ to have had my choice.It was the most
miserable little box I ever reposed in.Had I owned such a place on
shore, I _might_ have been induced to keep rabbits in it, or
guinea-pigs, but certainly not pigeons.Its length was barely six feet,
its width four above my cot and two below, and it was minus sufficient
standing-room for any ordinary-sized sailor; it was, indeed, a cabin for
a commodore--I mean Commodore Nutt--and was ventilated by a scuttle
seven inches in diameter, which could only be removed in harbour, and
below which, when we first went to sea, I was fain to hang a leather
hat-box to catch the water; unfortunately the bottom rotted out, and I
was then at the mercy of the waves.My cabin, or rather--to stick to the plain unvarnished truth--my burrow,
was alive with scorpions, cockroaches, ants, and other "crawlin'
ferlies.""That e'en to name would be unlawfu'."My dispensary was off the steerage, and sister-cabin to the pantry.To
it I gained access by a species of crab-walking, squeezing myself past a
large brass pump, and edging my body in sideways.The sick came one by
one to the dispensary door, and there I saw and treated each case as it
arrived, dressed the wounds and bruises and putrefying sores, and
bandaged the bad legs.There was no sick-berth attendant; to be sure
the lieutenant-in-command, at my request, told off "a little cabin-boy"
for my especial use.I had no cause for delectation on such an
acquisition, by no means; he was not a model cabin-boy like what you see
in theatres, and I believe will never become an admiral.He managed at
times to wash out the dispensary, or gather cockroaches, and make the
poultices--only in doing the first he broke the bottles, and in
performing the last duty he either let the poultice burn or put salt in
it; and, finally, he smashed my pot, and I kicked him forward, and
demanded another._He_ was slightly better, only he was seldom visible;
and when I set him to do anything, he at once went off into a sweet
slumber; so I kicked him forward too, and had in despair to become my
own menial.In both dispensary and burrow it was quite a difficult
business to prevent everything going to speedy destruction.The best
portions of my uniform got eaten by cockroaches or moulded by damp,
while my instruments required cleaning every morning, and even that did
not keep rust at bay.Imagine yourself dear reader, in any of the following interesting
positions:--

Very thirsty, and nothing but boiling hot newly distilled water to
drink; or wishing a cool bath of a morning, and finding the water in
your can only a little short of 212 degrees Fahrenheit.To find, when you awake, a couple of cockroaches, two inches in length,
busy picking your teeth.To find one in a state of decay in the mustard-pot.To have to arrange all the droppings and eggs of these interesting
creatures on the edge of your plate, previous to eating your soup.To have to beat out the dust and weevils from every square inch of
biscuit before putting it in your mouth.To be looking for a book and put your hand on a full-grown scaly
scorpion.Nice sensation--the animal twining round your finger, or
running up your sleeve._Denouement_--cracking him under foot--
full-flavoured bouquet--joy at escaping a sting.You are enjoying your dinner, but have been for some time sensible of a
strange titillating feeling about the region of your ankle; you look down
at last to find a centipede on your sock, with his fifty hind-legs--you
thank God not his fore fifty--abutting on to your shin._Tableau_--
green and red light from the eyes of the many-legged; horror of yourself
as you wait till he thinks proper to "move on."To awake in the morning, and find a large and healthy-looking tarantula
squatting on your pillow within ten inches of your nose, with his
basilisk eyes fixed on yours, and apparently saying, "You're only just
awake, are you?I've been sitting here all the morning watching you."You know if you move he'll bite you, somewhere; and if he _does_ bite
you, you'll go mad and dance _ad libitum_; so you twist your mouth in
the opposite direction and ejaculate--

"Steward!"but the steward does not come--in fact he is forward, seeing
after the breakfast.Meanwhile the gentleman on the pillow is moving
his horizontal mandibles in a most threatening manner, and just as he
makes a rush for your nose you tumble out of bed with a shriek; and, if
a very nervous person, probably run on deck in your shirt.Or, to fall asleep under the following circumstances: The bulkheads, all
around, black with cock-and-hen-roaches, a few of which are engaged
cropping your toe-nails, or running off with little bits of the skin of
your calves; bugs in the crevices of your cot, a flea tickling the sole
of your foot, a troop of ants carrying a dead cockroach over your
pillow, lively mosquitoes attacking you everywhere, hammer-legged flies
occasionally settling on your nose, rats running in and rats running
out, your lamp just going out, and the delicious certainty that an
indefinite number of earwigs and scorpions, besides two centipedes and a
tarantula, are hiding themselves somewhere in your cabin.Officers, as well as men, are allowed one half-gill of rum
daily, with this difference,--the former pay for theirs, while the
latter do not.ROUND THE CAPE AND UP THE 'BIQUE.It was a dark-grey cloudy forenoon when we "up anchor" and sailed from
Simon's Bay.Frequent squalls whitened the water, and there was every
indication of our being about to have dirty weather; and the tokens told
no lies.To our little craft, however, the foul weather that followed
seemed to be a matter of very little moment; for, when the wind or waves
were in any way high, she kept snugly below water, evidently thinking
more of her own convenience than our comfort, for such a procedure on
her part necessitated our leading a sort of amphibious existence, better
suited to the tastes of frogs than human beings.Our beds too, or
matresses, became converted into gigantic poultices, in which we nightly
steamed, like as many porkers newly shaven.Judging from the amount of
salt which got encrusted on our skins, there was little need to fear
danger, we were well preserved--so much so indeed, that, but for the
constant use of the matutinal freshwater bath, we would doubtless have
shared the fate of Lot's wife and been turned into pillars of salt.After being a few days at sea the wind began to moderate, and finally
died away; and instead thereof we had thunderstorms and waves, which, if
not so big as mountains, would certainly have made pretty large hills.Many a night did we linger on deck till well nigh morning, entranced by
the sublime beauty and terrible grandeur of those thunderstorms.The
roar and rattle of heaven's artillery; the incessant _floods_ of
lightning--crimson, blue, or white; our little craft hanging by the bows
to the crest of each huge inky billow, or next moment buried in the
valley of the waves, with a wall of black waters on every side; the wet
deck, the slippery shrouds, and the faces of the men holding on to the
ropes and appearing so strangely pale in the electric light; I see the
whole picture even now as I write--a picture, indeed, that can never,
never fade from my memory.Our cruising "ground" lay between the island and town of Mozambique in
the south, to about Magadoxa, some seven or eight degrees north of the
Equator.Nearly the whole of the slave-trade is carried on by the Arabs, one or
two Spaniards sometimes engaging in it likewise.The slaves are brought
from the far interior of South Africa, where they can be purchased for a
small bag of rice each.They are taken down in chained gangs to the
coast, and there in some secluded bay the dhows lie, waiting to take
them on board and convey them to the slave-mart at Zanzibar, to which
place Arab merchants come from the most distant parts of Arabia and
Persia to buy them.Dhows are vessels with one or two masts, and a
corresponding number of large sails, and of a very peculiar
construction, being shaped somewhat like a short or Blucher boot, the
high part of the boot representing the poop.They have a thatched roof
over the deck, the projecting eaves of which render boarding exceedingly
difficult to an enemy.Sometimes, on rounding the corner of a lagoon island, we would quietly
and unexpectedly steam into the midst of a fleet of thirty to forty of
these queer-looking vessels, very much to our own satisfaction, and
their intense consternation.Imagine a cat popping down among as many
mice, and you will be able to form some idea of the scramble that
followed.However, by dint of steaming here and there, and expending a
great deal of shot and shell, we generally managed to keep them together
as a dog would a flock of sheep, until we examined all their papers with
the aid of our interpreter, and probably picked out a prize.I wish I could say the prizes were anything like numerous; for perhaps
one-half of all the vessels we board are illicit slaveholders, and yet
we cannot lay a finger on them.It has been
said, and it is generally believed in England, that our cruisers are
sweeping the Indian Ocean of slavers, and stamping out the curse.But
the truth is very different, and all that we are doing, or able at
present to do, is but to pull an occasional hair from the hoary locks of
the fiend Slavery.This can be proved from the return-sheets, which
every cruiser sends home, of the number of vessels boarded, generally
averaging one thousand yearly to each man-o'-war, of which the half at
least have slaves or slave-irons on board; but only two, or at most
three, of these will become prizes.The reason of this will easily be
understood, when the reader is informed, that the Sultan of Zanzibar has
liberty to take any number of slaves from any one portion of his
dominions to another: these are called household slaves; and, as his
dominions stretch nearly all along the eastern shores of Africa, it is
only necessary for the slave-dealer to get his sanction and seal to his
papers in order to steer clear of British law.This, in almost every
case, can be accomplished by means of a bribe.So slavery flourishes,
the Sultan draws a good fat revenue from it, and the Portuguese--no
great friends to us at any time--laugh and wink to see John Bull paying
his thousands yearly for next to nothing.Supposing we liberate even
two thousand slaves a year, which I am not sure we do however, there are
on the lowest estimate six hundred slaves bought and sold daily in
Zanzibar mart; two hundred and nineteen thousand in a twelvemonth; and,
of our two thousand that are set free in Zanzibar, most, if not all,
by-and-bye, become bondsmen again.I am not an advocate for slavery, and would like to see a wholesale raid
made against it, but I do not believe in the retail system; selling
freedom in pennyworths, and spending millions in doing it, is very like
burning a penny candle in seeking for a cent.Yet I sincerely believe,
that there is more good done to the spread of civilisation and religion
in one year, by the slave-traffic, than all our missionaries can do in a
hundred.Don't open your eyes and smile incredulously, intelligent
reader; we live in an age when every question is looked at on both
sides, and why should not this?What becomes of the hundreds of
thousands of slaves that are taken from Africa?They are sold to the
Arabs--that wonderful race, who have been second only to Christians in
the good they have done to civilisation; they are taken from a state of
degradation, bestiality, and wretchedness, worse by far than that of the
wild beasts, and from a part of the country too that is almost unfit to
live in, and carried to more favoured lands, spread over the sunny
shores of fertile Persia and Arabia, fed and clothed and cared for;
after a few years of faithful service they are even called sons and feed
at their master's table--taught all the trades and useful arts, besides
the Mahommedan religion, which is certainly better than none--and, above
all, have a better chance given them of one day hearing and learning the
beautiful tenets of Christianity, the religion of love.I have met with few slaves who after a few years did not say, "Praised
be Allah for the good day I was take from me coontry!"and whose only
wish to return was, that they might bring away some aged parent, or
beloved sister, from the dark cheerless home of their infancy.Means and measures much more energetic must be brought into action if
the stronghold of slavedom is to be stormed, and, if not, it were better
to leave it alone."If the work be of God ye cannot overthrow it; lest
haply ye be found to fight even against God."THE DAYS WHEN WE WENT GIPSYING.QUILP THE
PILOT AND LAMOO.It might have been that our vessel was launched on a Friday, or sailed
on a Friday; or whether it was owing to our carrying the devil on board
of us in shape of a big jet-black cat, and for whom the lifebuoy was
thrice let go, and boats lowered in order to save his infernal majesty
from a watery grave; but whatever was the reason, she was certainly a
most unlucky ship from first to last; for during a cruise of eighteen
months, four times did we run aground on dangerous reefs, twice were we
on fire--once having had to scuttle the decks--once we sprung a bad leak
and were nearly foundering, several times we narrowly escaped the same
speedy termination to our cruise by being taken aback, while, compared
to our smaller dangers or lesser perils, Saint Paul's adventures--as a
Yankee would express it--wern't a circumstance.On the other hand, we were amply repaid by the many beautiful spots we
visited; the lovely wooded creeks where the slave-dhows played at hide
and seek with us, and the natural harbours, at times surrounded by
scenery so sweetly beautiful and so charmingly solitary, that, if
fairies still linger on this earth, one must think they would choose
just such places as these for their moonlight revels.Then there were
so many little towns--Portuguese settlements--to be visited, for the
Portuguese have spread themselves, after the manner of wild
strawberries, all round the coast of Africa, from Sierra Leone on the
west to Zanzibar on the east.There was as much sameness about these
settlements as about our visits to them: a few houses--more like tents--
built on the sand (it does seem funny to see sofas, chairs, and the
piano itself standing among the deep soft sand); a fort, the guns of
which, if fired, would bring down the walls; a few white-jacketed
swarthy-looking soldiers; a very polite governor, brimful of hospitality
and broken English; and a good dinner, winding up with punch of
schnapps.Memorable too are the pleasant boating excursions we had on the calm
bosom of the Indian Ocean.Armed boats used to be detached to cruise
for three or four weeks at a time in quest of prizes, at the end of
which time they were picked up at some place of rendezvous.By day we
sailed about the coast and around the small wooded islets, where dhows
might lurk, only landing in sheltered nooks to cook and eat our food.Our provisions were ship's, but at times we drove great bargains with
the naked natives for fowls and eggs and goats; then would we make
delicious soups, rich ragouts, and curries fit for the king of the
Cannibal Islands.Fruit too we had in plenty, and the best of oysters
for the gathering, with iguana most succulent of lizards, occasionally
fried flying-fish, or delicate morsels of shark, skip-jack, or devilled
dolphin, with a glass of prime rum to wash the whole down, and three
grains of quinine to charm away the fever.There was, too, about these
expeditions, an air of gipsying that was quite pleasant.To be sure our
beds were a little hard, but we did not mind that; while clad in our
blanket-suits, and covered with a boat-sail, we could defy the dew.Sleep, or rather the want of sleep, we seldom had to complain of, for
the blue star-lit sky above us, the gentle rising and falling of the
anchored boat, the lip-lipping of the water, and the sighing sound of
the wind through the great forest near us--all tended to woo us to
sweetest slumber.Sometimes we would make long excursions up the rivers of Africa,
combining business with pleasure, enjoying the trip, and at the same
time gleaning some useful information regarding slave or slave-ship.The following sketch concerning one or two of these may tend to show,
that a man does not take leave of all enjoyment, when his ship leaves
the chalky cliffs of old England.Our anchor was dropped outside the bar of Inambane river; the grating
noise of the chain as it rattled through the hawse-hole awoke me, and I
soon after went on deck.It was just six o'clock and a beautiful clear
morning, with the sun rising red and rosy--like a portly gentleman
getting up from his wine--and smiling over the sea in quite a pleasant
sort of way.So, as both Neptune and Sol seemed propitious, the
commander, our second-master, and myself made up our minds to visit the
little town and fort of Inambane, about forty--we thought fifteen--miles
up the river.But breakfast had to be prepared and eaten, the magazine
and arms got into the boat, besides a day's provisions, with rum and
quinine to be stowed away, so that the sun had got a good way up the
sky, and now looked more like a portly gentleman whose dinner had
disagreed, before we had got fairly under way and left the ship's side.Never was forenoon brighter or fairer, only one or two snowy banks of
cloud interrupting the blue of the sky, while the river, miles broad,
stole silently seaward, unruffled by wave or wavelet, so that the hearts
of both men and officers were light as the air they breathed was pure.The men, bending cheerfully on their oars, sang snatches of Dibdin--
Neptune's poet laureate; and we, tired of talking, reclined astern,
gazing with half-shut eyes on the round undulating hills, that, covered
with low mangrove-trees and large exotics, formed the banks of the
river.We passed numerous small wooded islands and elevated sandbanks,
on the edges of which whole regiments of long-legged birds waded about
in search of food, or, starting at our approach, flew over our heads in
Indian file, their bright scarlet-and-white plumage showing prettily
against the blue of the sky.Shoals of turtle floated past, and
hundreds of rainbow- jelly-fishes, while, farther off, many
large black bodies--the backs of hippopotami--moved on the surface of
the water, or anon disappeared with a sullen plash.Saving these sounds
and the dip of our own oars, all was still, the silence of the desert
reigned around us, the quiet of a newly created world.The forenoon wore away, the river got narrower, but, though we could see
a distance of ten miles before us, neither life nor sign of life could
be perceived.At one o'clock we landed among a few cocoa-nut trees to
eat our meagre dinner, a little salt pork, raw, and a bit of biscuit.No sooner had we "shoved off" again than the sky became overcast; we
were caught in, and had to pull against, a blinding white-squall that
would have laid a line-of-battle on her beam ends.The rain poured down
as if from a water-spout, almost filling the boat and drenching us to
the skin, and, not being able to see a yard ahead, our boat ran aground
and stuck fast.It took us a good hour after the squall was over to
drag her into deep water; nor were our misfortunes then at an end, for
squall succeeded squall, and, having a journey of uncertain length still
before us, we began to feel very miserable indeed.It was long after four o'clock when, tired, wet, and hungry, we hailed
with joy a large white house on a wooded promontory; it was the
Governor's castle, and soon after we came in sight of the town itself.Situated so far in the interior of Africa, in a region so wild, few
would have expected to find such a little paradise as we now beheld,--a
colony of industrious Portuguese, a large fort and a company of
soldiers, a governor and consulate, a town of nice little detached
cottages, with rows of cocoa-nut, mango, and orange trees, and in fact
all the necessaries, and luxuries of civilised life.It was, indeed, an
oasis in the desert, and, to us, the most pleasant of pleasant
surprises.Leaving the men for a short time with the boat, we made our way to the
house of the consul, a dapper little gentleman with a pretty wife and
two beautiful daughters--flowers that had hitherto blushed unseen and
wasted their sweetness in the desert air.After making us swallow a glass of brandy
each to keep off fever, he kindly led us to a room, and made us strip
off our wet garments, while a servant brought bundle after bundle of
clothes, and spread them out before us.There were socks and shirts and
slippers galore, with waistcoats, pantaloons, and head-dresses, and
jackets, enough to have dressed an opera troupe.The commander and I
furnished ourselves with a red Turkish fez and dark-grey dressing-gown
each, with cord and tassels to correspond, and, thus, arrayed, we
considered ourselves of no small account.Our kind entertainers were
waiting for us in the next room, where they had, in the mean time, been
preparing for us the most fragrant of brandy punch.By-and-bye two
officers and a tall Parsee dropped in, and for the next hour or so the
conversation was of the most animated and lively description, although a
bystander, had there been one, would not have been much edified, for the
following reason: the younger daughter and myself were flirting in the
ancient Latin language, with an occasional soft word in Spanish; our
commander was talking in bad French to the consul's lady, who was
replying in Portuguese; the second-master was maintaining a smart
discussion in broken Italian with the elder daughter; the Parsee and
officer of the fort chiming in, the former in English, the latter in
Hindostanee; but as no one of the four could have had the slightest idea
of the other's meaning, the amount of information given and received
must have been very small,--in fact, merely nominal.It must not,
however, be supposed that our host or hostesses could speak _no_
English, for the consul himself would frequently, and with a bow that
was inimitable, push the bottle towards the commander, and say, as he
shrugged his shoulders and turned his palms skywards, "Continue you, Sar
Capitan, to wet your whistle;" and, more than once, the fair creature by
my side would raise and did raise the glass to her lips, and say, as her
eyes sought mine, "Good night, Sar Officeer," as if she meant me to be
off to bed without a moment's delay, which I knew she did not.Then,
when I responded to the toast, and complimented her on her knowledge of
the "universal language," she added, with a pretty shake of the head,
"No, Sar Officeer, I no can have speak the mooch Englese."A servant,--
apparently newly out of prison, so closely was his hair cropped,--
interrupted our pleasant confab, and removed the seat of our Babel to
the dining-room, where as nicely-cooked-and-served a dinner as ever
delighted the senses of hungry mortality awaited our attention.No
large clumsy joints, huge misshapen roasts or bulky boils, hampered the
board; but dainty made-dishes, savoury stews, piquant curries, delicate
fricassees whose bouquet tempted even as their taste and flavour
stimulated the appetite, strange little fishes as graceful in shape as
lovely in colour, vegetables that only the rich luxuriance of an African
garden could supply, and numerous other nameless nothings, with
delicious wines and costly liqueurs, neatness, attention, and kindness,
combined to form our repast, and counteract a slight suspicion of
crocodiles' tails and stewed lizard, for where ignorance is bliss a
fellow is surely a fool if he is wise.We spent a most pleasant evening in asking questions, spinning yarns,
singing songs, and making love.The younger daughter--sweet child of
the desert--sang `Amante de alguno;' her sister played a selection from
`La Traviata;' next, the consul's lady favoured us with something
pensive and sad, having reference, I think, to bright eyes, bleeding
hearts, love, and slow death; then, the Parsee chanted a Persian hymn
with an "Allalallala," instead of Fol-di-riddle-ido as a chorus, which
elicited "Fra poco a me" from the Portuguese lieutenant; and this last
caused our commander to seat himself at the piano, turn up the white of
his eyes, and in very lugubrious tones question the probability of
"Gentle Annie's" ever reappearing in any spring-time whatever; then,
amid so much musical sentimentality and woe, it was not likely that I
was to hold my peace, so I lifted up my voice and sang--

  "Cauld kail in Aberdeen,
  An' cas ticks in Strathbogie;
  Ilka chiel maun hae a quean
  Bit leeze me on ma cogie--"

with a pathos that caused the tears to trickle over and adown the nose
of the younger daughter--she was of the gushing temperament--and didn't
leave a dry eye in the room.The song brought down the house--so to
speak--and I was the hero for the rest of the evening.Before parting
for the night we also sang `Auld lang syne,' copies of the words having
been written out and distributed, to prevent mistakes; this was supposed
by our hostess to be the English national anthem.It was with no small amount of regret that we parted from our friends
next day; a fresh breeze carried us down stream, and, except our running
aground once or twice, and being nearly drowned in crossing the bar, we
arrived safely on board our saucy gunboat.------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Afric's sunny fountains" have been engaged for such a length of time in
the poetical employment of "rolling down their golden sands," that a
bank or bar of that same bright material has been formed at the mouth of
every river, which it is very difficult and often dangerous to cross
even in canoes.We had despatched boats before us to take soundings on
the bar of Lamoo, and prepared to follow in the track thus marked out.Now, our little bark, although not warranted, like the Yankee boat, to
float wherever there is a heavy dew, was nevertheless content with a
very modest allowance of the aqueous element; in two and a half fathoms
she was quite at home, and even in two--with the help of a few
breakers--she never failed to bump it over a bar.We approached the bar
of Lamoo, therefore, with a certain degree of confidence till the keel
rasped on the sand; this caused us to turn astern till we rasped again;
then, being neither able to get back nor forward, we stopped ship, put
our fingers in our wise mouths, and tried to consider what next was to
be done.Just then a small canoe was observed coming bobbing over the
big waves that tumbled in on the bar; at one moment it was hidden behind
a breaker, next moment mounting over another, and so, after a little
game at bo-peep, it got alongside, and from it there scrambled on board
a little, little man, answering entirely to Dickens's description of
Quilp.added I, "by all that's small and ugly.""Your sarvant, sar," said Quilp himself.There
certainly was not enough of him to make two.He was rather darker in
skin than the Quilp of Dickens, and his only garment was a coal-sack
without sleeves--no coal-sack _has_ sleeves, however--begirt with a
rope, in which a short knife was stuck; he had, besides, sandals on his
feet, and his temples were begirt with a dirty dishclout by way of
turban, and he repeated, "I am one pilot, sar.""I do it, sar, plenty quick."I do him," cried the little man, as he mounted the
bridge; then cocking his head to one side, and spreading out his arms
like a badly feathered duck, he added, "Suppose I no do him plenty
proper, you catchee me and make shot.""If the vessel strikes, I'll hang you, sir."Quilp grinned--which was his way of smiling."And a half three," sung the man in the chains; then, "And a half four;"
and by-and-bye, "And a half three" again; followed next moment by, "By
the deep three."We were on the dreaded bar; on each
side of us the big waves curled and broke with a sullen boom like
far-off thunder; only, where we were, no waves broke."Mind yourself now," cried the commander to Quilp; to which he in wrath
replied--

"What for you stand there make bobbery?_I_ is de cap'n; suppose you is
fear, go alow, sar."and a large wave broke right aboard of us, almost sweeping us
from the deck, and lifting the ship's head into the sky.Another and
another followed; but amid the wet and the spray, and the roar of the
breakers, firmly stood the little pilot, coolly giving his orders, and
never for an instant taking his eyes from the vessel's jib-boom and the
distant shore, till we were safely through the surf and quietly steaming
up the river.After proceeding some miles, native villages began to appear here and
there on both shores, and the great number of dhows on the river, with
boats and canoes of every description, told us we were nearing a large
town.Two hours afterwards we were anchored under the guns of the
Sultan's palace, which were belching forth fire and smoke in return for
the salute we had fired.We found every creature and thing in Lamoo as
entirely primitive, as absolutely foreign, as if it were a city in some
other planet.The most conspicuous building is the Sultan's lofty fort
and palace, with its spacious steps, its fountains and marble halls.The streets are narrow and confused; the houses built in the Arab
fashion, and in many cases connected by bridges at the top; the
inhabitants about forty thousand, including Arabs, Persians, Hindoos,
Somali Indians, and slaves.The wells, exceedingly deep, are built in
the centre of the street without any protection; and girls, carrying on
their heads calabashes, are continually passing to and from them.Slaves, two and two, bearing their burdens of cowries and ivory on poles
between, and keeping step to an impromptu chant; black girls weaving
mats and grass-cloth; strange-looking tradesmen, with stranger tools, at
every door; rich merchants borne along in gilded palanquins; people
praying on housetops; and the Sultan's ferocious soldiery prowling
about, with swords as tall, and guns nearly twice as tall, as
themselves; a large shark-market; a fine bazaar, with gold-dust, ivory,
and tiger-skins exposed for sale; sprightly horses with gaudy trappings;
solemn-looking camels; dust and stench and a general aroma of savage
life and customs pervading the atmosphere, but law and order
nevertheless.No
spirituous liquor of any sort is sold in the town; the Sultan's soldiers
go about the streets at night, smelling the breath of the suspected, and
the faintest odour of the accursed fire-water dooms the poor mortal to
fifty strokes with a thick bamboo-cane next morning.The sugar-cane
grows wild in the fertile suburbs, amid a perfect forest of fine trees;
farther out in the country the cottager dwells beneath his few cocoa-nut
trees, which supply him with all the necessaries of life.One tree for
each member of his family is enough._He_ builds the house and fences
with its large leaves; his wife prepares meat and drink, cloth and oil,
from the nut; the space between the trees is cultivated for curry, and
the spare nuts are sold to purchase luxuries, and the rent of twelve
trees is only _sixpence_ of our money.no drunkenness,
no debt, no religious strife, but peace and contentment everywhere!Reader, if you are in trouble, or your affairs are going "to pot," or if
you are of opinion that this once favoured land is getting used up, I
sincerely advise you to sell off your goods and be off to Lamoo.Of the "gentlemen of England who live at home at ease," very few can
know how entirely dependent for happiness one is on his neighbours.Man
is out-and-out, or out-and-in, a gregarious animal, else `Robinson
Crusoe' had never been written.Now, I am sure that it is only correct
to state that the majority of combatant [Note 1] officers are, in simple
language, jolly nice fellows, and as a class gentlemen, having, in fact,
that fine sense of honour, that good-heartedness, which loves to do as
it would be done by, which hurteth not the feelings of the humble, which
turneth aside from the worm in its path, and delighteth not in plucking
the wings from the helpless fly.To believe, however, that there are no
exceptions to this rule would be to have faith in the speedy advent of
the millennium, that happy period of lamb-and-lion-ism which we would
all rather see than hear tell of; for human nature is by no means
altered by bathing every morning in salt water, it is the same afloat as
on shore.And there are many officers in the navy, who--"dressed in a
little brief authority," and wearing an additional stripe--love to lord
it over their fellow worms.Nor is this fault altogether absent from
the medical profession itself!It is in small gunboats, commanded perhaps by a lieutenant, and carrying
only an assistant-surgeon, where a young medical officer feels all the
hardships and despotism of the service; for if the lieutenant in command
happens to be at all frog-hearted, he has then a splendid opportunity of
puffing himself up.In a large ship with from twenty to thirty officers in the mess, if you
do not happen to meet with a kindred spirit at one end of the table, you
can shift your chair to the other.But in a gunboat on foreign service,
with merely a clerk, a blatant middy, and a second-master who would fain
be your senior, as your messmates, then, I say, God help you!unless you
have the rare gift of doing anything for a quiet life.It is all
nonsense to say, "Write a letter on service about any grievance;" you
can't write about ten out of a thousand of the petty annoyances which go
to make your life miserable; and if you do, you will be but little
better, if, indeed, your last state be not worse than your first.I have in my mind's eye even now a lieutenant who commanded a gunboat in
which I served as medical officer in charge.This little man was what
is called a sea-lawyer--my naval readers well know what I mean; he knew
all the Admiralty Instructions, was an amateur engineer, only needed the
title of M.D.to make him a doctor, could quibble and quirk, and in fact
could prove by the Queen's Regulations that your soul, to say nothing of
your body, wasn't your own; that _you_ were a slave, and _he_ lord--god
of all he surveyed.he has gone to his account; he
will not require an advocate, he can speak for himself.Not many such
hath the service, I am happy to say.He was continually changing his
poor hard-worked sub-lieutenants, and driving his engineers to drink,
previously to trying them by court-martial.At first he and I got on
very well; apparently he "loved me like a vera brither;" but we did not
continue long "on the same platform," and, from the day we had the first
difference of opinion, he was my foe, and a bitter one too.I assure
you, reader, it gave me a poor idea of the service, for it was my first
year.He was always on the outlook for faults, and his kindest words to
me were "chaffing" me on my accent, or about my country.To be able to
meet him on his own ground I studied the Instructions day and night, and
tried to stick by them.Malingering was common on board; one or two whom I caught I turned to
duty: the men, knowing how matters stood between the commander and me,
refused to work, and so I was had up and bullied on the quarter-deck for
"neglect of duty" in not putting these fellows on the sick-list.After
this I had to put every one that asked on the sick-list."Doctor," he would say to me on reporting the number sick, "this is
_wondrous_ strange--_thirteen_ on the list, out of only ninety men.Why, sir, I've been in line-of-battle ships,--_line-of-battle_ ships,
sir,--where they had not ten sick--_ten sick_, sir."This of course
implied an insult to me, but I was like a sheep before the shearers,
dumb.On Sunday mornings I went with him the round of inspection; the sick who
were able to be out of hammock were drawn up for review: had he been
half as particular with the men under his own charge or with the ship in
general as he was with the few sick, there would have been but little
disease to treat.Instead of questioning _me_ concerning their
treatment, he interrogated the sick themselves, quarrelling with the
medicine given, and pooh-pooh-ing my diagnosis.Those in hammocks, who
most needed gentleness and comfort, he bullied, blamed for being ill,
and rendered generally uneasy.Remonstrance on my part was either taken
no notice of, or instantly checked.If men were reported by me for
being dirty, giving impudence, or disobeying orders, _he_ became their
advocate--an able one too--and _I_ had to retire, sorry I had spoken.But I would not tell the tenth part of what I had to suffer, because
such men as he are the _exception_, and because he is dead.A little
black baboon of a boy who attended on this lieutenant-commanding had one
day incurred his displeasure: "Bo'swain's mate," cried he, "take my boy
forward, hoist him on an ordinary seaman's back, and give him a
rope's-ending; and," turning to me, "Doctor, you'll go and attend my
boy's flogging."With a face like crimson I rushed
below to my cabin, and--how could I help it?--made a baby of myself for
once; all my pent-up feelings found vent in a long fit of crying.True, I might in this case have written a letter to the service about my
treatment; but, as it is not till after twelve months the
assistant-surgeon is confirmed, the commander's word would have been
taken before mine, and I probably dismissed without a court-martial.That probationary year I consider more than a grievance, it is a _cruel
injustice_.There is a regulation--of late more strictly enforced by a
circular--that every medical officer serving on board his own ship shall
have a cabin, and the choice--by rank--of cabin, and he is a fool if he
does not enforce it.But it sometimes happens that a sub-lieutenant
(who has no cabin) is promoted to lieutenant on a foreign station; he
will then rank above the assistant-surgeon, and perhaps, if there is no
spare cabin, the poor doctor will have to give up his, and take to a
sea-chest and hammock, throwing all his curiosities, however valuable,
overboard.It would be the duty of the captain in such a case to build
an additional cabin, and if he did not, or would not, a letter to the
admiral would make him.Does the combatant officer treat the medical officer with respect?Certainly, unless one or other of the two be a snob: in the one case the
respect is not worth having, in the other it can't be expected.In the military branch you shall find many officers belonging to the
best English families: these I need hardly say are for the most part
gentlemen, and gentle men.However, it is allowed in most messes that

  "The rank is but the guinea's stamp,
  A man's man for a' that;"

and I assure the candidate for a commission, that, if he is himself a
gentleman, he will find no want of admirers in the navy.But there are
some young doctors who enter the service, knowing their profession to be
sure, and how to hold a knife and fork--not a carving-fork though--but
knowing little else; yet even these soon settle down, and, if they are
not dismissed by court-martial for knocking some one down at cards, or
on the quarter-deck, turn out good service-officers.Indeed, after all,
I question if it be good to know too much of fine-gentility on entering
the service, for, although the navy officers one meets have much that is
agreeable, honest, and true, there is through it all a vein of what can
only be designated as the coarse.The science of conversation, that
beautiful science that says and lets say, that can listen as well as
speak, is but little studied.Mostly all the talk is "shop," or rather
"ship."There is a want of tone in the discourse, a lack of refinement.The delicious chit-chat on new books, authors, poetry, music, or the
drama, interspersed with anecdote, incident, and adventure, and
enlivened with the laughter-raising pun or happy bon-mot, is, alas!but
too seldom heard: the rough joke, the tales of women, ships, and former
ship-mates, and the old, old, stale "good things,"--these are more
fashionable at our navy mess-board.Those who would object to such
conversation are in the minority, and prefer to let things hang as they
grew.Now, only one thing can ever alter this, and that is a good and
perfect library in every ship, to enable officers, who spend most of
their time out of society, to keep up with the times if possible.But I
fear I am drifting imperceptibly into the subject of navy-reform, which
I prefer leaving to older and wiser heads.Combatant (from combat, a battle), fighting officers,--as if
the medical offices didn't fight likewise.It would be better to take
away the "combat," and leave the "ant"--ant-officers, as they do the
work of the ship.There is one grievance which the medical officers, in common with their
combatant brethren, have to complain of--I refer to _compulsory
shaving_; neither is this by any means so insignificant a matter as it
may seem.It may appear a ridiculous statement, but it is nevertheless
a true one, that this regulation has caused many a young surgeon to
prefer the army to the navy."Mere dandies," the reader may say, "whom
this grievance would affect;" but there is many a good man a dandy, and
no one could surely respect a man who was careless of his personal
appearance, or who would willingly, and without a sigh, disfigure his
face by depriving it of what nature considers both ornate and useful--
ornate, as the ladies and the looking-glass can prove; and useful, as
the blistered chin and upper lip of the shaven sailor, in hot climates,
points out.From the earliest ages the moustache has been worn,--even
the Arabs, who shave the head, leave untouched the upper lip.What
would the pictures of some of the great masters be without it?Didn't
the Roman youths dedicate the first few downy hairs of the coming
moustache to the gods?Does not the moustache give a manly appearance
to the smallest and most effeminate?Does it not even beget a certain
amount of respect for the wearer?What sort of guys would the razor
make of Count Bismark, Dickens, the Sultan of Turkey, or Anthony
Trollope?Were the Emperor Napoleon deprived of his well-waxed
moustache, it might lose him the throne of France.Were Garibaldi to
call on his barber, he might thereafter call in vain for volunteers, and
English ladies would send him no more splints nor sticking-plaster.Shave Tennyson, and you may put him in petticoats as soon as you please.As to the moustache movement in the navy, it is a subject of talk--
admitting of no discussion--in every mess in the service, and thousands
are the advocates in favour of its adoption.Indeed, the arguments in
favour of it are so numerous, that it is a difficult matter to choose
the best, while the reasons against it are few, foolish, and despotic.At the time when the Lords of the Admiralty gave orders that the navy
should keep its upper lip, and three fingers' breadth of its royal chin,
smooth and copper-kettlish, it was neither fashionable nor respectable
to wear the moustache in good society.Those were the days of
cabbage-leaf cheeks, powdered wigs, and long queues; but those times are
past and gone from every corner of England's possessions save the navy.Barberism has been hunted from polite circles, but has taken refuge
under the trident of old Neptune; and, in these days of comparative
peace, more blood in the Royal Navy is drawn by the razor than by the
cutlass.In our little gunboat on the coast of Africa, we, both officers and men,
used, under the rose, to cultivate moustache and whiskers, until we fell
in with the ship of the commodore of the station.Then, when the
commander gave the order, "All hands to shave," never was such a
hurlyburly seen, such racing hither and thither (for not a moment was to
be lost), such sharpening of scissors and furbishing up of rusty razors.On one occasion I remember sending our steward, who was lathering his
face with a blacking-brush, and trying to scrape with a carving-knife,
to borrow the commander's razor; in the mean time the commander had
despatched his soapy-faced servant to beg the loan of mine.Both
stewards met with a clash, nearly running each other through the body
with their shaving gear.I lent the commander a Syme's bistoury, with
which he managed to pluck most of the hairs out by the root, as if he
meant to transplant them again, while I myself shaved with an amputating
knife.The men forward stuck by the scissors; and when the commander,
with bloody chin and watery eyes, asked why they did not shave,--"Why,
sir," replied the bo'swain's mate, "the cockroaches have been and gone
and eaten all our razors, they has, sir."Then, had you seen us reappear on deck after the terrible operation,
with our white shaven lips and shivering chins, and a foolish grin on
every face, you would, but for our uniform, have taken us for tailors on
strike, so unlike were we to the brave-looking, manly dare-devils that
trod the deck only an hour before.And if army officers and men have been graciously permitted to wear the
moustache since the Crimean war, why are not we?But perhaps the navy
took no part in that gallant struggle.But if we _must_ continue to do
penance by shaving, why should it not be the crown of the head, or any
other place, rather than the upper lip, which every one can see?One item of duty there is, which occasionally devolves on the medical
officer, and for the most part goes greatly against the feelings of the
_young_ surgeon; I refer to his compulsory attendance at floggings.It
is only fair to state that the majority of captains and commanders use
the cat as seldom as possible, and that, too, only sparingly.In some
ships, however, flogging is nearly as frequent as prayers of a morning.Again, it is more common on foreign stations than at home, and boys of
the first or second class, marines, and ordinary seamen, are for the
most part the victims.I do not believe I shall ever forget the first exhibition of this sort I
attended on board my own ship; not that the spectacle was in any way
more revolting than scores I have since witnessed, but because the sight
was new to me.I remember it wanted fully twenty minutes of seven in the morning, when
my servant aroused me."A flaying match, you know, sir," said Jones.My heart gave an anxious "thud" against my ribs, as if I myself were to
form the "ram for the sacrifice."I hurried through with my bath, and,
dressing myself as if for a holiday, in cocked hat, sword, and undress
coat, I went on deck.All the
minutiae of the scene I remember as though it were but yesterday,
morning was cool and clear, the hills clad in lilac and green, seabirds
floating high in air, and the waters of the bay reflecting the line of
the sky and the lofty mountain-sides, forming a picture almost dreamlike
in its quietness and serenity.The men were standing about in groups,
dressed in their whitest of pantaloons, bluest of smocks, and neatest of
black silk neckerchiefs.By-and-bye the culprit was led aft by a file
of marines, and I went below with him to make the preliminary
examination, in order to report whether or not he might be fit for the
punishment.He was as good a specimen of the British marine as one could wish to
look upon, hardy, bold, and wiry.His crime had been smuggling spirits
on board."Needn't examine me, Doctor," said he; "I ain't afeard of their four
dozen; they can't hurt me, sir,--leastways my back you know--my breast
though; hum-m!"and he shook his head, rather sadly I thought, as he
bent down his eyes."What," said I, "have you anything the matter with your chest?""Nay, Doctor, nay; its my feelins they'll hurt.I've a little girl at
home that loves me, and--bless you, sir, I won't look her in the face
again no-how."No lack of strength there, no nervousness; the artery
had the firm beat of health, the tendons felt like rods of iron beneath
the finger, and his biceps stood out hard and round as the mainstay of
an old seventy-four.I pitied the brave fellow, and--very wrong of me it was, but I could not
help it--filled out and offered him a large glass of rum.sir," he said, with a wistful eye on the ruby liquid, "don't tempt
me, sir.I can bear the bit o' flaying athout that: I wouldn't have my
messmates smell Dutch courage on my breath, sir; thankee all the same,
Doctor."All hands had already assembled, the men and boys on one side, and the
officers, in cocked hats and swords, on the other.A grating had been
lashed against the bulwark, and another placed on deck beside it.The
culprit's shoulders and back were bared, and a strong belt fastened
around the lower part of the loins for protection; he was then firmly
tied by the hands to the upper, and by the feet to the lower grating; a
little basin of cold water was placed at his feet; and all was now
prepared.The sentence was read, and orders given to proceed with the
punishment.The cat is a terrible instrument of torture; I would not
use it on a bull unless in self-defence: the shaft is about a foot and a
half long, and covered with green or red baize according to taste; the
thongs are nine, about twenty-eight inches in length, of the thickness
of a goose-quill, and with two knots tied on each.Men describe the
first blow as like a shower of molten lead.Combing out the thongs with his five fingers before each blow, firmly
and determinedly was the first dozen delivered by the bo'swain's mate,
and as unflinchingly received.Then, "One dozen, sir, please," he reported, saluting the commander."Continue the punishment," was the calm reply.Another dozen reported; again, the same reply.The flesh, like burning steel, had changed from red to
purple, and blue, and white; and between the third and fourth dozen, the
suffering wretch, pale enough now, and in all probability sick, begged a
comrade to give him a mouthful of water.There was a tear in the eye of
the hardy sailor who obeyed him, whispering as he did so--

"Keep up, Bill; it'll soon be over now.""Five, six," the corporal slowly counted--"seven, eight."It is the
last dozen, and how acute must be the torture!The blood
comes now fast enough, and--yes, gentle reader, I _will_ spare your
feelings.The man was cast loose at last and put on the sick-list; he
had borne his punishment without a groan and without moving a muscle.A
large pet monkey sat crunching nuts in the rigging, and grinning all the
time; I have no doubt _he_ enjoyed the spectacle immensely, _for he was
only an ape_.Tommie G--was a pretty, fair-skinned, blue-eyed boy, some sixteen
summers old.He was one of a class only too common in the service;
having become enamoured of the sea, he had run away from his home and
joined the service; and, poor little man!he found out, when too late,
that the stern realities of a sailor's life did not at all accord with
the golden notions he had formed of it.Being fond of stowing himself
away in corners with a book, instead of keeping his watch, Tommie very
often got into disgrace, spent much of his time at the mast-head, and
had many unpleasant palmar rencounters with the corporal's cane.One
day, his watch being over, he had retired to a corner with his little
"ditty-box."Nobody ever knew one-half of the beloved nicknacks and valued nothings
he kept in that wee box: it was in fact his private cabin, his sanctum
sanctorum, to which he could retreat when anything vexed him; a sort of
portable home, in which he could forget the toils of his weary watch,
the giddy mast-head, or even the corporal's cane.He had extracted, and
was dreamily gazing on, the portrait of a very young lady, when the
corporal came up and rudely seized it, and made a very rough and
inelegant remark concerning the fair virgin."That is my sister," cried Tommie, with tears in his eyes.sneered the corporal; "she is a--" and he added a word
that cannot be named.There was the spirit of young England, however,
in Tommie's breast; and the word had scarcely crossed the corporal's
lips, when those lips, and his nose too, were dyed in the blood the
boy's fist had drawn.For that blow poor Tommie was condemned to
receive four dozen lashes.And the execution of the sentence was
carried out with all the pomp and show usual on such occasions.Arrayed
in cooked-hats, epaulets, and swords, we all assembled to witness that
helpless child in his agony.One would have thought that even the rough
bo'swain's mate would have hesitated to disfigure skin so white and
tender, or that the frightened and imploring glance Tommie cast upward
on the first descending lash would have unnerved his arm.No,
reader; pity there doubtless was among us, but mercy--none.And the poor boy writhed in his agony; his screams and
cries were heartrending; and, God forgive us!we knew not till then he
was an orphan, till we heard him beseech his mother in heaven to look
down on her son, to pity and support him.well, perhaps she did,
for scarcely had the third dozen commenced when Tommie's cries were
hushed, his head drooped on his shoulder like a little dead bird's, and
for a while his sufferings were at an end.I gladly took the
opportunity to report further proceedings as dangerous, and he was
carried away to his hammock.I will not shock the nerves and feelings of the reader by any further
relation of the horrors of flogging, merely adding, that I consider
corporal punishment, as applied to men, _cowardly, cruel_, and debasing
to human nature; and as applied to boys, _brutal_, and sometimes even
_fiendish_.There is only one question I wish to ask of every
true-hearted English lady who may read these lines--Be you sister, wife,
or mother, could you in your heart have respected the commander who,
with folded arms and grim smile, replied to poor Tommie's frantic
appeals for mercy, "Continue the punishment"?The pay of medical officers is by no means high enough to entice young
doctors, who can do anything like well on shore, to enter the service.Ten shillings a day, with an increase of half-a-crown after five years'
service on full pay, is not a great temptation certainly.To be sure
the expenses of living are small, two shillings a day being all that is
paid for messing; this of course not including the wine-bill, the size
of which will depend on the "drouthiness" of the officer who contracts
it.Government provides all mess-traps, except silver forks and spoons.Then there is uniform to keep up, and shore-going clothes to be paid
for, and occasionally a shilling or two for boat-hire.However, with a
moderate wine-bill, the assistant-surgeon may save about four shillings
or more a day.Promotion to the rank of surgeon, unless to some fortunate individuals,
comes but slowly; it may, however, be reckoned on after from eight to
ten years.A few gentlemen out of each "batch" who "pass" into the
service, and who have distinguished themselves at the examination, are
promoted sooner.It seems to be the policy of the present Director-General to deal as
fairly as possible with every assistant-surgeon, after a certain
routine.On first joining he is sent for a short spell--too short,
indeed--to a hospital.He is then appointed to a sea-going ship for a
commission--say three years--on a foreign station.On coming home he is
granted a few months' leave on full pay, and is afterwards appointed to
a harbour-ship for about six months.By the end of this time he is
supposed to have fairly recruited from the fatigues of his commission
abroad; he is accordingly sent out again to some other foreign station
for three or four years.On again returning to his native land, he
might be justified in hoping for a pet appointment, say to a hospital,
the marines, a harbour-ship, or, failing these, to the Channel fleet.On being promoted he is sent off abroad again, and so on; and thus he
spends his useful life, and serves his Queen and country, and earns his
pay, and generally spends that likewise.Pensions are granted to the widows of assistant-surgeons--from forty to
seventy pounds a year, according to circumstances; and if he leaves no
widow, a dependent mother, or even sister, may obtain the pension.But
I fear I must give, to assistant-surgeons about to many, Punch's advice,
and say most emphatically, "Don't;" unless, indeed, the dear creature
has money, and is able to purchase a practice for her darling doctor.With a little increase of pay ungrudgingly given, shorter commissions
abroad, and less of the "bite and buffet" about favours granted, the
navy would be a very good service for the medical officer.However, as it is, to a man who has neither wife nor riches, it is, I
dare say, as good a way of spending life as any other; and I do think
that there are but few old surgeons who, on looking back to the life
they have led in the navy, would not say of that service,--"With all thy
faults I love thee still."The obituary of 1829 will not record a name more gifted or more
dear!In a county where he was one of the oldest, as well as one of the
most constant of its inhabitants, it were superfluous to enumerate his
many claims to distinction and regret.His learning, his sagacity, his
exquisite taste, his indefatigable ardour, would have raised to eminence
a man much less conspicuous by his station in life, by his
correspondence with the principal literati of Europe, and by the
attraction and polish of his conversation and manners.Possessing his
admirable faculties to so venerable an age, we must deplore that a
gentleman who conferred such honour on our county is removed from that
learned retirement in which he delighted, and from that enchanting scene
which, in every sense, he so greatly adorned.He is succeeded in his
title by his only son, now Sir Robert Price, one of our
representatives."Sir Uvedale published the following:

     1.An Essay on the Picturesque, as compared with the Sublime and
     Beautiful, and on the use of studying pictures for the purpose of
     improving real landscape, 8vo.This volume was afterwards
     published in 1796, in 8vo.with _considerable additions_, and in
     1798 was published at _Hereford_ a second volume, being an Essay on
     Artificial Water, an Essay on Decorations near the House, and an
     Essay on Architecture and Buildings as connected with Scenery.A Letter to H. Repton, Esq.on the application of the practice
     and principles of Landscape Painting to Landscape Gardening.Intended as a supplement to the Essays.Second edition,
     _Hereford_, 1798, 8vo.This is a sportive display of pleasant wit,
     polished learning, and deep admiration of the great landscape
     painters.Keen as some of his pages are, and lamenting that there
     should have been any controversy ("or tilting at each other's
     breasts,") on the subject of Launcelot Browne's works, "I trust,
     (says he,) however, that my friends will vouch for me, that
     whatever sharpness there may be in my style, there is no rancour in
     my heart."Repton in his Enquiry into the Changes of Landscape
     Gardening, acknowledges "the elegant and gentleman-like manner in
     which Mr.Indeed, many pages in
     this present letter shew this.A Dialogue on the distinct Characters of the Picturesque and the
     Beautiful, in answer to the objections of Mr.Knight, 1801,
     8vo.[102]

A general review of Sir Uvedale's ideas on this subject, is candidly
given by Mr.after a mature study of
_all_ the modern writers who have endeavoured to form "a taste for the
harmony and connection of natural scenery."Loudon farther calls him
"the great reformer of landscape gardening."We have to regret, that though so many springs must have cheered the
long life of Sir Uvedale Price, (and which he calls the _dolce prima
vera, gioventu dell'anno_, and whose blossoms, flowers, and
"profusion of fresh, gay, and beautiful colours and sweets," he so
warmly dwelt on in many of his pages,) and though the number of these
springs must have nearly equalled those which gilded the days of Lord
Kames, of the honourable Horace Walpole, of Mr.Gilpin, and of Joseph
Cradock, Esq.yet we have to regret that his classic pen has presented
to the public no other efforts of his genius and cultivated taste, than
the few respectable ones above stated.Had he chose to have indulged his
own powers in describing what has been done towards "embellishing the
face of this noble kingdom," (to quote his own words,) we might have
perused descriptive pages equal to his own critical and refined review
of Blenheim, or of Powis Castle, and of a character as high and pure, as
those of Thomas Whateley.In proof of this, we need only refer to many
pages in his Essays,--not only when he so well paints the charms of
sequestered nature, whether in its deep recesses, _o'er canopied with
luscious eglantine_,--in the "modest and retired character of a
brook,"--the rural simplicity of a cottage, with its lilacs and fruit
trees, its rustic porch, covered with vine or ivy, but when he dwells on
the ruins and on "the religious calm" of our abbeys,[103] or on our old
mansion-houses, with their terraces, their summer-houses covered with
ivy, and mixed with wild vegetation.And we need farther only to refer
to those feeling pages in his second volume, where he laments that his
own youth and inexperience should (in order to follow the silly folly of
_being in the fashion_,) have doomed to sudden and total destruction an
old paternal garden, with all its embellishments, and whose destruction
revives in these pages all the emotions of his youth; and he concludes
these pages of regret, by candidly confessing, that he gained little but
"much difficulty, expence and dirt," and that he thus detains his
readers in relating what so personally concerns himself, "because there
is nothing so useful to others, however humiliating to ourselves, as
the frank confession of our errors and of their causes.No man can
equally with the person who committed them, impress upon others the
extent of the mischief done, and the regret that follows it."It is
painful to quit pages so interesting as those that immediately follow
this quotation.[104]

There are few objects that the enlightened mind of Sir Uvedale has not
remarked.Take the following as an instance:

"Nothing is so captivating, or seems so much to accord with our ideas of
beauty, as the smiles of a beautiful countenance; yet they have
sometimes a striking mixture of the other character.Of this kind are
those smiles which break out suddenly from a serious, sometimes from
almost a severe countenance, and which, when that gleam is over, leave
no trace of it behind--

   _Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
   That in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth,
   And e'er a man has time to say, behold!The jaws of darkness do devour it up._

There is another smile, which seems in the same degree to accord with
the ideas of beauty only: it is that smile which proceeds from a mind
full of sweetness and sensibility, and which, when it is over, still
leaves on the countenance its mild and amiable impression; as after the
sun is set, the mild glow of his rays is still diffused over every
object.This smile, with the glow that accompanies it, is beautifully
painted by Milton, as most becoming an inhabitant of heaven:

   To whom the angel, with a smile that glow'd
   Celestial rosy red, love's proper hue,
   Thus answered."The great object in the above Essays, is to improve the laying out of
grounds by studying the productions "of those great artists _who have
most diligently studied the beauties of nature_.On this subject he has
in these volumes poured forth the effusions of his richly gifted mind,
in his contemplation of the works of those really great painters, whose
landscape scenery, from the most rural to the grandest, "have been
consecrated by long uninterrupted admiration."Instead of the narrow,
mechanical practice of a few English gardeners, or layers-out of
grounds, he wishes "the noble and varied works of the eminent painters
of every age, and of every country, and those of _their_ supreme
mistress NATURE, should be the great models of imitation."[105] He has
supported many of his opinions or observations, or embellished or
enlivened them, by acute allusions, not only to Milton but to
Shakspeare, whom he calls "that most original creator, and most accurate
observer."[106]

He has depicted his own mind in p.378 of the first volume of his
Essays; for after lamenting that despotic system of improvement which
demands all to be laid open,--all that obstructs to be levelled to the
ground,--houses, orchards, gardens, all swept away,--nothing tending to
humanize the mind--and that a despot thinks every person an intruder who
enters his domain, wishing to destroy cottages and pathways, and to
reign alone, he thus proceeds:--"Here I cannot resist paying a tribute
to the memory of a beloved uncle, and recording a benevolence towards
all the inhabitants around him, that struck me from my earliest
remembrance; and it is an impression I wish always to cherish.It seemed
as if he had made his extensive walks as much for them as for himself;
they used them as freely, and their enjoyment was his.The village bore
as strong marks of his and of his brother's attentions (for in that
respect they appeared to have but one mind), to the comforts and
pleasures of its inhabitants.Such attentive kindnesses, are amply
repaid by affectionate regard and reverence; and were they general
throughout the kingdom, they would do much more towards guarding us
against democratical opinions

   _Than twenty thousand soldiers, arm'd in proof._

The cheerfulness of the scene I have mentioned, and all the interesting
circumstances attending it, (so different from those of solitary
grandeur,) have convinced me, that he who destroys dwellings, gardens
and inclosures, for the sake of mere extent, and parade of property,
only extends the bounds of monotony, and of dreary, selfish pride; but
contrasts those of vanity, amusement and humanity."One may trace, too, his feeling mind towards the conclusion of his
second volume, where, after many pleasing pages on the rural scenery of
cottages, and in hamlets and villages, ("where a lover of humanity may
find so many sources of amusement and interest,") and on the means of
embellishing them, "I could wish (says he) to turn the minds of
improvers from too much attachment to solitary parade, towards objects
more connected with general habitation and embellishment;... and it may
be truly said, that there is no way in which wealth can produce such
natural unaffected variety, and such interest, as by adorning a real
village, and promoting the comforts and enjoyments of its inhabitants._Goldsmith_ has most feelingly described (more, I trust, from the warmth
of a poetical imagination and quick sensibility than from real fact),
the ravages of wealthy pride.My aim is to shew, that they are no less
hostile to real taste, than to humanity; and should I succeed, it is
possible that those, whom all the affecting images and pathetic touches
of Goldsmith would not have restrained from destroying a village, may
even be induced to build one, in order to shew their taste in the
decoration and disposition of village-houses and cottages."After many
traces of village scenery, he thus proceeds: "The church, together with
the church-yard, is, on various accounts, an interesting object to the
villagers of every age and disposition; to the old and serious, as a
spot consecrated to the purposes of religion, where the living christian
performs his devotions, and where, after his death, his body is
deposited near those of his ancestors and departed friends, and
relations: to the young and thoughtless, as a place where, on the day of
rest from labour, they meet each other in their holiday clothes; and
also (what forms a singular contrast with tombs and grave-stones), as
the place which at their wakes, is the chief scene of their gaiety and
rural sports."After speaking of the yew, which from the solemnity of
its foliage, is most suited to church-yards, being as much consecrated
to the dead as the cypress among the ancients, he says that "there seems
to be no reason, why in the more southern parts of England, cypresses
should not be mixed with yews, or why cedars of Libanus, which are
perfectly hardy, and of a much quicker growth than yews, should not be
introduced.In high romantic situations, particularly, where the
church-yard is elevated above the general level, a cedar, spreading his
branches downwards from that height, would have the most picturesque,
and at the same time, the most solemn effect."Johnson's lately published History of
English Gardening, to add a very early tract on that subject, and I take
the liberty of transcribing his exact words: "A Boke of Husbandry,
London, 4to.This little work is very rare, being one of the productions
from the press of Wynkin de Worde.It consists of but twelve leaves, and
is without date, but certainly was not of a later year than 1500.'Here begyneth a treatyse of
Husbandry which Mayster Groshede somtyme Bysshop of Lyncoln made, and
translated it out of Frensshe into Englyshe, whiche techeth all maner of
men to governe theyr londes, tenementes, and demesnes ordinately.''Here endeth the Boke of Husbandry, _and of Plantynge, and Graffynge of
Trees and Vynes_.'"Nichols printed the Life of Robert
_Grosseteste_, the celebrated Bishop of Lincoln.With an Account of the Bishop's _Works_, &c. Illustrated with plates of
his Tomb, Ring, and Crosier.Page 17.--I have in this page alluded to the hard fate of Correggio.That my reader may know who he was, let him inspect those pages in vol.i. of Sir U. Price's Essays, where he thus concludes a critique on his
genius: "I believe that if a variety of persons, conversant in painting,
were asked what pictures (taking every circumstance together) appeared
to them most beautiful, and had left the softest and most pleasing
impression,--the majority would fix upon Correggio."Lawson, in the dedication to his New Orchard and Garden,
gives the name of an author on gardening, whose book I have not met
with.He dedicates it "to the right worshipfull _Sir Henry Belosses_,"
and he acknowledges, "1st.the many courtesies you have vouchsaved me.your delightfull skill in matters of this nature.the profit
which I received from your _learned discourse of Fruit-trees_.your animating and assisting of others to such endeavours.Last of all,
the rare worke of your owne in this kind, all which to publish under
your protection, I have adventured as you see."From this it would
appear, that this "learned discourse" is transfused into the New Orchard
and Garden.After all, perhaps, this "learned discourse" was merely in
conversation.At all events, it has recorded the name of Sir Henry as
warmly devoted to orcharding, or to horticulture.W. Lawson, in his
preface, dwells upon the praises of this art, "how some, and not a few
of the best, have accounted it a chiefe part of earthly happinesse to
have faire and pleasant orchards--how ancient, how profitable, how
pleasant it is."His fourteenth chapter is On the Age of Fruit-trees.After stating that some "shall dure 1000 years," and the age of many of
the apple-trees in his little orchard, he says: "If my trees be 100
yeares old, and yet want 200 of their growth before they leave
increasing, which make 300, then we must needs resolve, that this 300
yeere are but the third part of a tree's life, because (as all things
living besides) so trees must have allowed them for their increase one
third, another third for their stand, and a third part of time also for
their decay."--"So that I resolve upon good reason, that Fruit-trees
well ordered, may live and live 1000 yeeres, and beare fruit, and the
longer, the more, the greater, and the better, because his vigour is
proud and stronger, when his yeeres are many.You shall see old trees
put their buds and blossoms both sooner and more plentifully than young
trees by much.And I sensibly perceive my young trees to inlarge their
fruit, as they grow greater, both for number, and greatnesse."--"And if
Fruit-trees last to this age, how many ages is it to be supposed, strong
and huge Timber-trees will last?whose huge bodies require the yeeres of
divers _Methushalaes_, before they end their days; whose sap is strong
and better, whose barke is hard and thicke, and their substance solid
and stiffe: all which are defences of health and long life.Their
strength withstands all forcible winds."His seventeenth chapter is on
the Ornaments of an Orchard.I here give the whole of that chapter:


"Me thinks hitherto we haue but a bare Orchard for fruit, and but halfe
good, so long as it wants those comely ornaments, that should giue
beauty to all our labours, and make much for the honest delight of the
owner and his friends."For it is not to be doubted: but as God hath giuen man things
profitable, so hath he allowed him honest comfort, delight, and
recreation in all the workes of his hands.Nay, all his labours vnder
the sunne without this are troubles, and vexation of mind: For what is
greedy gaine, without delight, but moyling, and turmoyling slauery?But
comfortable delight, with content, is the good of euery thing, and the
patterne of heauen.A morsell of bread with comfort, is better by much
than a fat oxe with vnquietnesse.And who can deny, but the principall
end of an Orchard, is the honest delight of one wearied with the works
of his lawfull calling?The very workes of and in an Orchard and Garden,
are better than the ease and rest of and from other labours.When God
had made man after his owne image, in a perfect state, and would haue
him to represent himselfe in authority, tranquillity and pleasure vpon
the earth, he placed him in Paradise.but a Garden
and Orchard of trees and hearbs, full of pleasure?The gods of the earth, resembling the great God of heauen in
authority, maiestie, and abundance of all things, wherein is their most
delight?and whither doe they withdraw themselues from the troublesome
affaires of their estate, being tyred with the hearing and iudging of
litigious Controuersies?choked (as it were) with the close ayres of
their sumptuous buildings, their stomacks cloyed with variety of
Banquets, their eares filled and ouerburthened with tedious
discoursings?but into their Orchards, made and prepared,
dressed and destinated for that purpose, to renue and refresh their
sences, and to call home their ouer-wearied spirits.Nay, it is (no
doubt) a comfort to them, to set open their cazements into a most
delicate Garden and Orchard, whereby they may not onely see that,
wherein they are so much delighted, but also to giue fresh, sweet, and
pleasant ayre to their galleries and chambers."And looke, what these men do by reason of their greatnes and ability,
prouoked with delight, the same doubtlesse would euery of vs doe, if
power were answerable to our desires, whereby we shew manifestly, that
of all other delights on earth, they that are taken by Orchards, are
most excellent, and most agreeing with nature."For whereas euery other pleasure commonly filles some one of our
sences, and that onely, with delight, this makes all our sences swimme
in pleasure, and that with infinite variety, ioyned with no less
commodity."That famous philosopher, and matchlesse orator, M. T. C. prescribeth
nothing more fit, to take away the tediousnesse and heauy load of three
or foure score yeeres, than the pleasure of an Orchard."What can your eyes desire to see, your ears to hear, your mouth to
tast, or your nose to smell, that is not to be had in an Orchard, with
abundance and variety?What more delightsome than an infinite variety of
sweet smelling flowers?decking with sundry colours, the greene mantle
of the earth, vniuersall mother of vs all, so by them bespotted, so
dyed, that all the world cannot sample them, and wherein it is more fit
to admire the Dyer, than imitate his workemanship.Colouring not onely
the earth, but decking the ayre, and sweetning euery breath and spirit."The rose red, damaske, veluet, and double double prouince rose, the
sweet muske rose, double and single, the double and single white rose.The faire and sweet senting Woodbinde, double and single, and double
double.Purple cowslips, and double cowslips, and double double
cowslips.The violet nothing behinde the
best, for smelling sweetly.A thousand more will prouoke your content."And all these, by the skill of your gardner, so comely, and orderly
placed in your borders and squares, and so intermingled, that none
looking thereon, cannot but wonder, to see, what Nature corrected by Art
can doe."When you behold in diuers corners of your Orchard Mounts of stone, or
wood curiously wrought within and without, or of earth couered with
fruit-trees: Kentish cherry, damsons, plummes, &c. with staires of
precious workmanship.And in some corner (or moe) a true dyall or
Clocke, and some anticke workes, and especially siluer-sounding musique,
mixt instruments and voices, gracing all the rest: How will you be rapt
with delight?"Large walkes, broad and long, close and open, like the Tempe groves in
Thessalie, raised with grauell and sand, hauing seats and bankes of
cammomile, all this delights the minde, and brings health to the body."View now with delight the workes of your owne hands, your fruit-trees
of all sorts, loaden with sweet blossomes, and fruit of all tasts,
operations, and colours: your trees standing in comely order which way
soeuer you looke."Your borders on euery side hanging and drooping with feberries,
raspberries, barberries, currens, and the rootes of your trees powdred
with strawberries, red, white, and greene, what a pleasure is this?Your
gardner can frame your lesser wood to the shape of men armed in the
field, ready to giue battell: or swift running greyhounds: or of well
sented and true running hounds, to chase the deere, or hunt the hare.This kind of hunting shall not waste your corne, nor much your coyne."Mazes well framed a mans height, may perhaps make your friends wander
in gathering of berries, till he cannot recouer himselfe without your
helpe."To haue occasion to exercise within your Orchard: it shall be a
pleasure to haue a bowling alley, or rather (which is more manly, and
more healthfull) a paire of buts, to stretch your armes."Rosemary and sweete eglantine are seemely ornaments about a doore or
window, and so is woodbinde."And in mine opinion, I could highly commend your Orchard, if either
through it, or hard by it there should runne a pleasant riuer with
siluer streames: you might sit in your mount, and angle a pickled trout,
or sleightie eele, or some other dainty fish.Or moats, whereon you
might row with a boate, and fish with nettes."Store of bees in a dry and warme bee-house, comely made of fir-boords,
to sing, and sit, and feede vpon your flowers and sprouts, make a
pleasant noyse and sight.For cleanely and innocent bees, of all other
things, loue and become, and thriue in an Orchard.If they thriue (as
they must needes, if your gardner bee skilfull, and loue them: for they
loue their friends, and hate none but their enemies) they will, besides
the pleasure, yeeld great profit, to pay him his wages.Yea, the
increase of twenty stockes or stooles, with other fees, will keepe your
Orchard."You need not doubt their stings, for they hurt not whom they know, and
they know their keeper and acquaintance.If you like not to come amongst
them, you need not doubt them: for but neere their store, and in their
owne defence, they will not fight, and in that case onely (and who can
blame them?)Some (as that
Honorable Lady at Hacknes, whose name doth much grace mine Orchard) vse
to make seats for them in the stone wall of their Orchard, or Garden,
which is good, but wood is better."A vine ouer-shadowing a seate, is very comely, though her grapes with
vs ripe slowly."One chiefe grace that adornes an Orchard, I cannot let slip: A brood of
nightingales, who with their seuerall notes and tunes, with a strong
delightsome voyce, out of a weake body, will beare you company night and
day.She loues (and liues in) hots of woods in her hart.She will helpe
you to cleanse your trees of caterpillars, and all noysome wormes and
flyes.The gentle robin red-breast will helpe her, and in winter in the
coldest stormes will keepe a part.Neither will the silly wren be behind
in summer, with her distinct whistle (like a sweete recorder) to cheere
your spirits."The black-bird and threstle (for I take it the thrush sings not, but
deuoures) sing loudly in a May morning, delights the eare much (and you
neede not want their company, if you haue ripe cherries or berries, and
would as gladly as the rest do you pleasure:) But I had rather want
their company than my fruit.A thousand of pleasant delightes are attendant in an
Orchard: and sooner shall I be weary, than I can recken the least part
of that pleasure, which one that hath and loues an Orchard, may find
therein."What is there of all these few that I haue reckoned, which doth not
please the eye, the eare, the smell, and taste?And by these sences as
organes, pipes, and windowes, these delights are carried to refresh the
gentle, generous, and noble mind."To conclude, what ioy may you haue, that you liuing to such an age,
shall see the blessings of God on your labours while you liue, and
leaue behind you to heires or successors (for God will make heires) such
a worke, that many ages after your death, shall record your loue to
their countrey?And the rather, when you consider (chap.to what
length of time your worke is like to last."Page 30.--Having briefly glanced in this page at the delight with which
Sir H. Davy, Mr.Whateley, viewed the flowers of
spring, I can only add this reflection of Sturm:--"If there were no
stronger proofs on earth of the power, goodness, and wisdom of God, the
flowers of spring alone, would be sufficient to convince us of it."Page 45.--The character of this modest and candid man, (Switzer), has
found an able advocate in the honest pen of Mr.159
of his History of Gardening, after noticing the acrimony of his
opponents, observes, "Neglect has pursued him beyond the grave, for his
works are seldom mentioned or quoted as authorities of the age he lived
in.To me he appears to be the best author of his time; and if I was
called upon to point out the classic authors of gardening, _Switzer_
should be one of the first on whom I would lay my finger.His works
evidence him at once to have been a sound, practical horticulturist, a
man well versed in the botanical science of the day, in its most
enlarged sense."Johnson enumerates the distinct contents of each
chapter in the Iconologia--the Kitchen Gardener--and the Fruit Gardener.Page 59.--The Tortworth Chesnut was growing previous to the Norman
Conquest.Even in the reign of
Stephen, it was known as the great chesnut of Tortworth.Page 62.--The author of this treatise, who is a zealous orchardist, is
lavish in his praise of a then discovered apple-tree and its produce,
"for the little cot-house to which it belongs, together with the little
quillet in which it stands, being several years since mortgaged for ten
pounds, the fruit of this tree alone, in a course of some years, freed
the house and garden, and its more valuable self, from that burden."A
neighbouring clergyman, too, was equally lavish, for he "talked of it in
all conversations," and such was his praise of it, that every one "fell
to admiration."Stafford is so pleased with this reverend
gentleman's zeal, in extending the cultivation of this apple, (_the
Royal Wilding_) that he says, "I could really wish, whenever the
original tree decayeth, his statue carved out of the stump, by the most
expert hand, and overlaid with gold, may be erected near the public
road, in the place of it, at the common charge of the country."He
celebrates also another apple, which "in a pleasant conversation was
named by a gentleman _super-celestial_.Another gentleman, in allusion
to _Pynes_, the name of my house, and to the common story of the West
India pineapple, (which is said to be the finest fruit in the world, and
to represent every exquisite flavour that is known), determined that it
should be called the _pyne-apple_; and by either of these names it is
talked of when pleasantry and conversation bring the remembrance of it
to the table."Page 64.--It is but justice to Mr.Gibson to say, that in his Fruit
Gardener, he has entered fully into the merits of Le Genre's _Le maniere
de cultiver les arbres fruitiers_; and that his pages are extremely
interesting.The great merits of Quintinye are also not overlooked.Page 84.--To the list of those deceased authors, whose portraits I have
not been able to discover, I must add the following:


JOHN BRADDICK, Esq.A zealous horticulturist and fruit grower.He
contributed four papers to the Horticultural Society of London.1827, is a communication by him, on some new
French pears.The editor of this magazine acknowledges "the very liberal
and truly patriotic manner in which our highly-valued correspondent
shares every novelty he receives with those whose interest it is to
increase and disseminate such novelties."In the above magazine for
March, 1827, is another spirited communication by him, on these new
pears, introduced from France, in which he says:--"And here I think it
necessary to premise, that the following list is the cream skimmed off
some thousands of new pears, which I have for many years past been
getting together from various parts of the world, about two-thirds of
which yet remain for trial, not having fruited, together with some
thousands of seedling pears, apples, plums, cherries, apricots, peaches
and grapes, of my own raising; the fruits of some of which I hope will
continue to gladden the hearts of horticulturists for many years to
come.As they are produced I will make them known to the public, with as
much facility as lies in my power."_Boughton Mount, July 29, 1826._"

One is sorry to relate, that Mr.Braddick died soon after this
benevolent wish; for he died at the above seat of his, near Maidstone,
in April, 1828, at the age of sixty-three.Dibdin thus speaks of Archibald Alison: "The beautiful
and melodious style of this writer, renders his works deserving of a
conspicuous place in every well-chosen library."Page 89.--In this page I have stated that Dr.Dibdin says, "on many
accounts does G. Markham seem entitled to more notice and commendation."I have given extracts from his "English Husbandman," to shew his love
for flowers.The same attachment is visible where he enumerates them in
his "Country House-wive's Garden."--By the bye, though I have stated
this last work to be his, it surely appears to have been written by W.
Lawson.I merely now give the following extract from Markham's "English
House-Wife:"

"Next vnto this sanctity and holinesse of life, it is meet that our
English hous-wife be a woman of great modesty and temperance as well
inwardly as outwardly; inwardly, as in her behauiour and cariage towards
her husband, wherein she shall shunne all violence of rage, passion, and
humour, coueting lesse to direct then to be directed, appearing euer
vnto him pleasant, amiable, and delightfull, and though occasion,
mishaps, or the misgouernement of his will may induce her to contrary
thoughts, yet vertuously to suppresse them, and with a mild sufferance
rather to call him home from his error, then with the strength of anger
to abate the least sparke of his euill, calling in her mind that euill
and vncomely language is deformed though vttered euen to seruants, but
most monstrous and vgly when it appeares before the presence of a
husband: outwardly, as in her apparrell and diet, both which she shall
proportion according to the competency of her husband's estate and
calling, making her circle rather strait then large, for it is a rule if
we extend to the vttermost, we take away increase, if we goe a hayre
breadth beyond, we enter into consumption: but if we preserue any part,
we build strong forts against the aduersaries of fortune, prouided that
such preseruation be honest and conscionable: for a lauish prodigality
is brutish, so miserable couetuousnesse is hellish.Let therefore the
hus-wives garments be comly and strong, made aswel to preserue the
health, as adorne the person, altogether without toyish garnishes, or
the glosse of light colours, and as far from the vanity of new and
fantastick fashions, as neere to the comly imitations of modest
matrons."I must give an extract from his "Country Contentements," as he reminds
us of Shakspeare's lines on the tuneable cry of hounds; for Markham
dwells on their sweetness of cry--"their deepe solemne mouthes--their
roaring and loud ringing mouthes, which must beare the counter-tenor,
then some hollow plaine sweete mouthes--a deep-mouthed dog--a couple or
two of small singing beagles, which as small trebles, may warble amongst
them: the cry will be a great deale the more sweeter--the hollow deepe
mouth--the loud clanging mouthe--deepe flewed, such as for the most part
your _Shropshire_ and pure _Worcestershire_ dogs are--the louder and
pleasanter your cry will be, especially if it be in sounding tall woods,
or under the echo of rocks--and not above one couple of roarers, which
being heard but now and then, as at the opening or hitting of a scent,
will give much sweetnesse to the solemns, and gravenesse of the cry, and
the musick thereof will bee much more delightfull to the eares of every
beholder."Page 123.--The memory of Pope has perhaps never been more affectionately
honoured (nor that of Lord Mendip, who so zealously preserved every part
of the house and garden at Twickenham) than in the glowing and tender
lines of De Lille, in his poem of _Les Jardins_.The vignette in my title-page, and that at page 84, are two of those
neat decorations which so profusely embellish the Encyclopaedia of
Gardening.A.

FOOTNOTES:

[1] Few persons have shewn more attachment to family portraits than Miss
Seward.This is strongly exemplified in several bequests in her will;
not only in her bequest to Emma Sneyd, and in that to Mrs.Powys, but
also in the following:--"The miniature picture of my late dear friend,
Mr.Saville, drawn in 1770, by the late celebrated artist Smart, and
which at the time it was taken, and during many successive years, was an
exact resemblance of the original, I bequeath to his daughter, Mrs.Smith, who I know will value and preserve it as a jewel above all prize;
and in case of her previous demise, I bequeath the said precious
miniature to her daughter, Mrs.Honora Jager, exhorting the said Honora
Jager, and her heirs, into whose hands soever it may fall, to guard it
with sacred care from the sun and from damp, as I have guarded it, that
so the posterity of my valued friend may know what, in his prime, was
the form of him whose mind through life, by the acknowledgment of all
who knew him, and could discern the superior powers of talent and
virtue, was the seat of liberal endowment, warm piety, and energetic
benevolence."Being thus on the subject of portraits, let me remark, that it is not
always that we meet with a faithful likeness.de
Genlis's _Petrarch et Laure_, justly observes, that "it is doubtful if
any of the portraits of _Petrarch_, which still remain, were painted
during his life-time.However that may be, it is impossible to trace in
them, either the elevation of his mind, the fire of his imagination, or
the pensive melancholy of his soul."In the Essays on Petrarch, by Ugo
Foscolo, he informs us, that "_Petrarch's_ person, if we trust his
biographers, was so striking with beauties, as to attract universal
admiration.They represent him with large and manly features, eyes full
of fire, a blooming complexion, and a countenance that bespoke all the
genius and fancy that shone forth in his works."Do we yet know one
really good likeness of _Mary Queen of Scots_?[2] It has often struck me (perhaps erroneously), that the attachment
which the great Sully evinced for gardens, even to the last period of
his long-protracted life, (eighty-two), _might_ in some degree have been
cherished or increased from the writings of the great Lord Bacon.When
this illustrious duke retired to his country seats, wounded to the heart
by the baseness of those who had flattered him when Henry was alive, his
noble and honest mind indulged in the embellishment of his gardens.I
will very briefly quote what history relates:--"The life he led in his
retreat at _Villebon_, was accompanied with grandeur and even majesty,
such as might be expected from a character so grave and full of dignity
as his.His table was served with taste and magnificence; he admitted to
it none but the nobility in his neighbourhood, some of the principal
gentlemen, and the ladies and maids of honour, who belonged to the
duchess of Sully.He often went into his gardens, and passing through a
little covered alley, which separated the flower from the kitchen
garden, ascended by a stone staircase (which the present duke of Sully
has caused to be destroyed), into a large walk of linden trees, upon a
terrace on the other side of the garden.It was then the taste to have a
great many narrow walks, very closely shaded with four or five rows of
trees, or palisadoes.Here he used to sit upon a settee painted green,
amused himself by beholding on the one side an agreeable landscape, and
on the other a second alley on a terrace extremely beautiful, which
surrounded a large piece of water, and terminated by a wood of lofty
trees.There was scarce one of his estates, those especially which had
castles on them, where he did not leave marks of his magnificence, to
which he was chiefly incited by a principle of charity, and regard to
the public good.At _Rosny_, he raised that fine terrace, which runs
along the Seine, to a prodigious extent, and those great gardens, filled
with groves, arbours, and grottos, with water-works.He embellished
_Sully_ with gardens, of which the plants were the finest in the world,
and with a canal, supplied with fresh water by the little river Sangle,
which he turned that way, and which is afterwards lost in the Loire.He
erected a machine to convey the water to all the basons and fountains,
of which the gardens are full.He enlarged the castle of _La Chapelle
d'Angillon_, and embellished it with gardens and terraces."These gardens somewhat remind one of these lines, quoted by Barnaby
Gooche:

   _Have fountaines sweet at hand, or mossie waters,
   Or pleasaunt brooke, that passing through the meads, is sweetly seene._

That fine gardens delighted Sully, is evident even from his own
statement of his visit to the Duke d'Aumale's, at Anet, near Ivry,
(where Henry and Sully fought in that famous battle), for he says,--"Joy
animated the countenance of Madame d'Aumale the moment she perceived me.She gave me a most kind and friendly reception, took me by the hand, and
led me through those fine galleries and beautiful gardens, which make
Anet a most enchanting place."One may justly apply to Sully, what he
himself applies to the Bishop of Evreaux: "A man for whom eloquence and
great sentiments had powerful charms."I had designed some few years ago, to have published a Review of some of
the superb Gardens in France, during the reign of Henry IV.and during
the succeeding reigns, till the demise of Louis XV., embellished with
plates of some of the costly and magnificent decorations of those times;
with extracts from such of their eminent writers whose letters or works
may have occasionally dwelt on gardens.--My motto, for want of a better,
might have been these two lines from Rapin,

   _----France, in all her rural pomp appears
   With numerous gardens stored._

Perhaps I might have been so greedy and insolent, as to have presumed to
have monopolized our Shakspeare's line,--"I love _France_ so well, that
I will not part with a village of it; I will have it all mine."Isaac Walton gives the following lines from a translation of a German
poet, which makes one equally fond of England:

   We saw so many woods, and princely bowers,
   Sweet fields, brave palaces, and stately towers,
   _So many gardens dress'd with curious care_,
   That Thames with royal Tiber may compare.[3] The Encyclopaedia of Gardening has a rich page (35) devoted to Le
Notre.thus records his genius and his grand and
magnificent efforts:--"Ce grand homme fut choisi pour decorer les
jardins du chateau de Vau-le-Vicomte.Il en fit un sejour enchanteur,
par les ornamens nouveaux, pleins de magnificence, qu'il y prodigua.On
vit alors, pour la premiere fois, des portiques, des berceaux, des
grottes, des traillages, des labyrinths, &c. embellir varier le
spectacle des jardins.Le Roi, temoin des ces merveilles, lui donna la
direction de tous ses parcs.Il embellit par son art, Versailles,
Trianon, et il fit a St.Germain cette fameuse terrasse qu'on voit
toujours avec une nouvelle admiration.Les jardins de Clagny, de
Chantilly, de St.Cloud, de Meudon, de Sceaux, le parterre du Tibre, et
les canaux qui ornent ce lieu champetre a Fontainbleau, sont encore son
ouvrage.Il demanda a faire voyage de l'Italie, dans l'esperance
d'acquerir de nouvelles connoissances; mais son genie createur l'avoit
conduit a la perfection.Il ne vit rien de comparable a ce qu'il avoit
fait en France."Notwithstanding the above just and high tribute, I have no hesitation in
saying, that it is not superior to the magic picture which the
fascinating pen of Mad.de Sevigne has drawn of le Notre's creative
genius, in her letter of Aug.Many others of this charming
woman's letters breathe her love of gardens.[4] The Nouveau Dict.thus speaks of the Pere Rapin:--"A un genie
heureux, a un gout sur, il joignoit une probite exacte, un coeur droit,
un caractere aimable et des moeurs douces.Il etoit naturellement
honnete, et il s'etoit encore poli dans le commerce des grands.Parmi
ses differentes Poesies Latines, on distingue le Poeme des Jardins.C'est son chef d'oeuvre; il est digne du siecle d'Auguste, dit l'Abbe
Des Fontaines, pour l'elegance et la purete du langage, pour l'esprit et
les graces qui y regnent."Among the letters of Rabutin de Bussy, are
many most interesting ones from this worthy father.[5] "Rien n'est plus admirable que la peinture naive que la Pere Vaniere
fait des amusemens champetres; on est egalement enchante de la richesse
et de la vivacite de son imagination, de l'eclat et de l'harmonie de sa
poesie, du choix de la purete de ses expressions.Il mourut a Toulouse
en 1739, et plusiers poetes ornerent de fleurs son tombeau."--Nouv.[6] La Comtesse de la Riviere, thus alludes to this convent: "Madame de
Sevigne a pour ce monastere une veneration qui est audela de toute
expression; elle assure qu'on n'approche pas de ce lieu sans sentir au
dedans de soi une onction divine."[7] The late Sir U. Price, pays a very high compliment to this exquisite
poem, in p.i. of his Essays, terming it full of the justest
taste, and most brilliant imagery.[8] In the Earl of Harcourt's garden, at Nuneham, in Oxfordshire, (laid
out in some parts under the eye and fine taste of the poet Mason), on a
bust of Rousseau are these lines:

   Say, is thy honest heart to virtue warm?Approach, behold this venerable form;
     'Tis Rousseau!There are attractive pages in this little volume of the Viscount's,
which would have interested either Shenstone, or Gainsborough,
particularly the pages 59, 143, 145, and 146, (of Mr.Malthus's
translation), for in these pages "we feel all the truth and energy of
nature."131, will enable the reader to judge of
the writer's style:--"When the cool evening sheds her soft and
delightful tints, and leads on the hours of pleasure and repose, then is
the universal reign of sublime harmony.It is at this happy moment that
Claude has caught the tender colouring, the enchanting calm, which
equally attaches the heart and the eyes; it is then that the fancy
wanders with tranquillity over distant scenes.Masses of trees through
which the light penetrates, and under whose foliage winds a pleasant
path; meadows, whose mild verdure is still softened by the transparent
shades of the evening; crystal waters which reflect all the near objects
in their pure surface; mellow tints, and distances of blue vapour; such
are in general the objects best suited to a western exposure.The sun,
before he leaves the horizon, seems to blend earth and sky, and it is
from sky that evening views receive their greatest beauty.The
imagination dwells with delight upon the exquisite variety of soft and
pleasing colours, which embellishes the clouds and the distant country,
in this peaceful hour of enjoyment and contemplation."[9] He was enthusiastically devoted to the cultivation of his gardens,
which exhibited enchanting scenery, umbrageous walks, and magnificent
water-falls.When thus breathing the pure air of rural life, the
blood-stained monsters of 1793 seized him in his garden, and led him to
the scaffold."He heard unmoved his own sentence, but the condemnation
of his daughter and grand-daughter, tore his heart: the thought of
seeing two weak and helpless creatures perish, shook his fortitude.Being taken back to the _Conciergerie_, his courage returned, and he
exhorted his children to prepare for death.When the fatal bell rung, he
recovered all his wonted cheerfulness; having paid to nature the tribute
of feeling, he desired to give his children an example of magnanimity;
his looks exhibited the sublime serenity of virtue, and taught them to
view death undismayed.When he ascended the cart, he conversed with his
children, unaffected by the clamours of the ferocious populace; and on
arriving at the foot of the scaffold, took a last and solemn farewell of
his children; immediately after he was dismissed into eternity."Sir Walter Scott, after noticing "the wild and squalid features" of
Marat, who "lay concealed in some obscure garret or cellar, among his
cut-throats, until a storm appeared, when, like a bird of ill omen, his
death-screech was again heard," thus states the death of another of the
murderers of the Malherbes:--"Robespierre, in an unsuccessful attempt to
shoot himself, had only inflicted a horrible _fracture on his
under-jaw_.In this situation they were found like wolves in their lair,
foul with blood, mutilated, despairing, and yet not able to die.Robespierre lay on a table in an anti-room, his head supported by a deal
box, and his hideous countenance half-hidden by a bloody and dirty cloth
bound round his shattered chin.As the fatal cars passed to the
guillotine, those who filled them, but especially Robespierre, were
overwhelmed with execrations.The nature of his previous wound, from
which the cloth had never been removed till the executioner _tore_ it
off, added to the torture of the sufferer.The shattered jaw dropped,
and the wretch yelled aloud, to the horror of the spectators.A mask
taken from that dreadful head was long exhibited in different nations of
Europe, and appalled the spectator by its ugliness, and the mixture of
fiendish expression with that of bodily agony."Malherbes loved to relate an answer made to him by a common
fellow, during his stay at Paris, when he was obliged to go four times
every day to the prison of the Temple, to attend the king: his extreme
age did not allow him to walk, and he was compelled to take a carriage.One day, particularly, when the weather was intensely severe, he
perceived, on coming out of the vehicle, that the driver was benumbed
with cold."My friend," said Malherbes to him, in his naturally tender
manner, "you must be penetrated by the cold, and I am really sorry to
take you abroad in this bitter season."--"That's nothing, M. de
Malherbes; in such a cause as this, I'd travel to the world's end
without complaining."--"Yes, but your poor horses could not."--"Sir,"
replied the honest coachman, "_my horses think as I do_."[10] I cannot pass by the name of Henry, without the recollection of
what an historian says of him: "L'Abbe Langlet du Fresnoy a publie
cinquante-neuf lettres de a bon Roi, dans sa nouvelle edition du Journal
de Henry III.on y remarque du feu de l'esprit, de l'imagination, et
sur-tout cette eloquence du coeur, qui plait tout dans un monarque.--On
l'exortoit a traiter avec rigueur quelques places de la Ligue, qu'il
avoit redites par la force: _La satisfaction qu'on tire de la vengeance
ne dure qu'un moment_ (repondit ce prince genereuse) _mais celle qu'on
tire de la clemence est eternelle_.Plus on connoitre Henri, plus on
l'aimera, plus on l'admiriroet."[11] The king, knowing his fine taste for sculpture and painting, sent
him to Italy, and the Nouv.gives this anecdote: "La Pape
instruit de son merite, voulut le voir, et lui donna une assez longue
audience, sur la fin de laquelle le Notre s'ecria en s'adressant au
Pape: J'ai vu les plus grands hommes du monde, Votre Saintete, et le Roi
mon maitre.Il y a grande difference, dit le Pape; le Roi est un grand
prince victorieux, je suis un pauvre pretre serviteur des serviteurs de
Dieu.Le Notre, charme de cette reponse, oublia qui la lui faisoit, et
frappant sur l'epaule du Pape lui repondit a son tour: Mon Reverend
Pere, vous vous portez bien et vous enterrerez tout la Sacre College.Le
Pape, qui entendoit le Francois, rit du pronostic.Le Notre, charme de
plus en plus de sa bonte, et de l'estime particuliere qu'il temoignoit
pour le Roi, se jeta au cou du Pape et l'embrassa.C'etoit au reste sa
coutume d'embrasser tous ceux qui publioient les louanges de Louis XIV.,
et il embrassoit le Roi lui-meme, toutes les fois que ce prince revenoit
de la campagne."[12] I will conclude by mentioning a justly celebrated man, who, it
seems was not over fond of his garden, though warmly attached both to
Boileau, and to Mad.de Sevigne,--I mean that most eloquent preacher
Bossuet, of whom a biographer, after stating that he was so absorbed in
the study of the ancient fathers of the church, "qu'il ne se permettoit
que des delassemens fort courts.Il ne se promenoit que rarement meme
dans son jardin.Son jardinier lui dit un jour: _Si je plantois des
Saint Augustins, et des Saint Chrysostomes, vous les viendriez voir;
mais pour vos arbres, vous ne vous en souciez guere_."Worlidge, who wrote during part of the reigns of Charles II.judiciously observes, that "the glory of the French
palaces, often represented to our English eyes in sculpture, are adorned
_with their beauteous gardens before them_; which wanting, they would
seem without lustre or grandeur."[14] He was fined L30,000 for having taken a favourite of the king's, in
the very presence chamber, by the nose, for having insulted him, and
afterwards dragging him out of the room.[15] It was to this nobleman, that Addison addressed his elegant and
sublime epistle, after he had surveyed with the eyes and genius of a
classical poet, the monuments and heroic deeds of ancient Rome.[16] Lord Chesterfield thus speaks of this distinguished man:--"His
private life was stained by no vices, nor sullied by any meanness.His
eloquence was of every kind; but his invectives were terrible, and
uttered with such energy of diction and countenance, that he intimidated
those who were the most willing and the best able to encounter him."Sir
W. Chatham Trelawney used to observe of him, that it was impossible for
the members of the side opposed to him in the House of Commons to look
him in the face when he was warmed in debate: he seemed to bid them all
a haughty defiance."For my own part," said Trelawney, "I never dared
cast my eyes towards his, for if I did, _they nailed me to the floor_."Smollet says, that he displayed "such irresistible energy of argument,
and such power of elocution, as struck his hearers with astonishment and
admiration.It flashed like the lightning of heaven against the
ministers and sons of corruption, blasting where it smote, and withering
the nerves of opposition; but his more substantial praise was founded
upon his disinterested integrity, his incorruptible heart, his
unconquerable spirit of independance, and his invariable attachment to
the interest and liberty of his country."Another biographer thus
mentions him:--"His elevated aspect commanded the awe and mute attention
of all who beheld him, whilst a certain grace in his manner, conscious
of all the dignities of his situation, of the solemn scene he acted in,
as well as his own exalted character, seemed to acknowledge and repay
the respect he received; his venerable form, bowed with infirmity and
age, but animated by a mind which nothing could subdue; his spirit
shining through him, arming his eye with lightning, and cloathing his
lips with thunder; or, if milder topics offered, harmonizing his
countenance in smiles, and his voice in softness, for the compass of his
powers was infinite.As no idea was too vast, no imagination too
sublime, for the grandeur and majesty of his manner; so no fancy was too
playful, nor any allusion too comic, for the ease and gaiety with which
he could accommodate to the occasion.But the character of his oratory
was dignity; this presided in every respect, even to his sallies of
pleasantry."[17] Sir Walter Scott's attachment to gardens, breaks out even in his
Life of Swift, where his fond enquiries have discovered the sequestered
and romantic garden of _Vanessa_, at Marley Abbey.[18] So thought Sir W. Raleigh;

   Sweet violets, love's paradise, that spread
     Your gracious odours...
   Upon the gentle wing of some calm-breathing wind,
       That plays amidst the plain.The lines in Twelfth Night we all recollect:

   That strain again;--it had a dying fall:
   O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet south
   That breathes upon a bank of _violets_,
   Stealing and giving odour.That these flowers were the most favourite ones of Shakspeare, there can
be little doubt--Perditta fondly calls them

   ----sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
   Or Cytherea's breath.When Petrarch first saw Laura: "elle avail une robe verte, sa coleur
favorite, parsemee de _violettes_, la plus humble des fleurs."--Childe
Harold thus paints this flower:

   The sweetness of the violet's deep blue eyes
   (Kiss'd by the breath of heaven) seems colour'd by its skies.[19] One almost fancies one perceives Lord Bacon's attachment to
gardens, or to rural affairs, even in the speech he made before the
nobility, when first taking his seat in the High Court of Chancery; he
hoped "that these same _brambles_ that _grow_ about justice, of needless
charge and expence, and all manner of exactions, might be rooted out;"
adding also, that immediate and "_fresh_ justice was the _sweetest_."Mason, in a note to his English Garden, after paying a high
compliment to Lord Bacon's picturesque idea of a garden, thus concludes
that note:--"Such, when he descended to matters of more elegance (for,
when we speak of Lord Bacon, to treat of these was to descend,) were the
amazing powers of this universal genius."Pope's delight in gardens, is visible even in the condensed
allusion he makes to them, in a letter to Mr.Digby; "I have been above
a month strolling about in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, from garden
to garden, but still returning to Lord Cobham's, with fresh
satisfaction.I should be sorry to see my Lady Scudamore's, till it has
had the full advantage of Lord Bathurst's improvements."[21] A biographer thus speaks of the Prince de Ligne: "Quand les rois se
reunirent a Vienne en 1814, ils se firent tous un devoir de l'accuellier
avec distinction, et furent enchante de la vivacite de son esprit, et de
son intarissable gaiete, qui malgre ses infirmites et son grand age, ne
l'avoit pasencore abandonne.Ses saillies, et ses bon mots etoient comme
autrefois repetes pour tous."His generous heart thus speaks of the
abused and unfortunate Marie Antoinette:--"The breath of calumny has not
even respected the memory of the loveliest and best of women, of whose
spotless heart and irreproachable conduct, no one can bear stronger
evidence than I. Her soul was as pure as her face was fair; yet neither
virtue nor beauty could save the victim of sanguinary liberty."In
relating this (says his biographer), his voice faultered, and his eyes
were suffused with tears.He thus briefly states, with his usual humour
and vivacity, his conversation with Voltaire as to the garden at Ferney:

_P.de L._--Monsieur, Monsieur, cela doit vous coupe beaucoup, quel
charmant jardin!mon jardinier est un bete: c'est moi meme qui ait fait
tout.[22] Monsieur Thomas, in his eulogy of Descartes says, it should have
been pronounced at the foot of Newton's statue: or rather, Newton
himself should have been his panegyrist.Of this eulogy, Voltaire, in a
most handsome letter to Mons.Thomas, thus speaks:--"votre ouvrage
m'enchante d'un bout a l'autre, et Je vais le relire des que J'aurai
dicte ma lettre."The sleep and expanding of flowers are most
interestingly reviewed by Mr.187 of his Encyclop., and by
M. V. H. de Thury, in the above discourse, a few pages preceding his
seducing description of the magnificent garden of M. de Boursault.So late ago as the year 1804 it was proposed at Avignon, to erect an
obelisk in memory of Petrarch, at Vaucluse: "il a ete decide, qu'on
l'elevera, vis-avis _l'ancien jardin_ de Petrache, lieu ou le lit de
sorgue forme un angle."Walpole observes) was planted by the poet,
enriched by him with the fairy gift of eternal summer.Pope thus mentions the vines round this cave:--

   Depending vines the shelving cavern skreen,
   With purple clusters blushing through the green.are devoted to a very
interesting research on the gardens of the Romans.Sir Joseph Banks has
a paper on the Forcing Houses of the Romans, with a list of Fruits
cultivated by them, now in our gardens, in vol.Pulteney gives a list of several manuscripts in the Bodleian
Library, the writers of which are unknown, and the dates not precisely
determined, but supposed to have been written, if not prior to the
invention of printing, at least before the introduction of that art into
England.I select the two following.--

No.De Arboribus, Aromatis, et _Floribus_.Glossarium Latino-anglicum Arborum, _Fructuum_, Frugam, &c.

And he states the following from Bib.S. Petri Cant:--

No.Notabilia de Vegetabilibus, et Plantis.Pulteney observes, that the above list might have been considerably
extended, but that it would have unnecessarily swelled the article he
was then writing.mentions a personage whose attachment to his
garden, and one of whose motives for cultivating that garden, does not
deserve a notice:--"Attale III.Roi de Pergame, fils de Stratonice,
soulla la throne en repandant le sang de ses amis et de sea parens.Il
abandonna ensuite le soin de ses affaires _pour s'occuper entirement de
son jardin_.Il y cultivoit des poisons, tels que l'aconit et la cigue,
qu'il envoyoit quelque fois en present a ses amis.Il mourut 133 ans
avant Jesus Christ."[27] To have completed the various contrasting vicissitudes of this poor
_Suffolk_ farmer's life, he should have added to his other employments,
those of another _Suffolk_ man, the late W. Lomax, who had been
_grave-digger_ at the pleasant town of Bury St.Edmund's, for thirty-six
years, and who, also, for a longer period than thirty-six years, had
been a _morrice-dancer_ at all the elections for that borough.[28] Gerarde, speaking of good sorts of apples and pears, thus mentions
the above named _Pointer_:--"Master Richard Pointer has them all growing
in his ground at Twickenham, near London, who is a most cunning and
curious grafter and planter of all manner of rare fruits; and also in
the ground of an excellent grafter and painful planter, Master Henry
Bunbury, of Touthil-street, near unto Westminster; and likewise in the
ground of a diligent and most affectionate lover of plants, Master
Warner, neere Horsely Down, by London; and in divers other grounds about
London."[29] The fate of this poor man reminds one of what is related of
Corregio:--"He received from the mean canons of Parma, for his
Assumption of the Virgin, the small pittance of two hundred livres, and
it was paid him in copper.He hastened with the money to his starving
family; but as he had six or eight miles to travel from Parma, the
weight of his burden, and the heat of the climate, added to the
oppression of his breaking heart, a pleurisy attacked him, which, in
three days, terminated his existence and his sorrows in his fortieth
year."If one could discover a portrait of either of the authors mentioned in
the foregoing list, one might, I think, inscribe under each of such
portraits, these verses:

   Ce pourtrait et maint liure
   Par le peintre et l'escrit,
   Feront reuoir et viure
   Ta face et ton esprit.They are inscribed under an ancient portrait, done in 1555, which Mr.Dibdin has preserved in his account of Caen, and which he thus
introduces: "As we love to be made acquainted with the _persons_ of
those from whom we have received instruction and pleasure, so take,
gentle reader, a representation of Bourgueville."John Parkinson, an apothecary of this city, (yet living, and
labouring for the common good,) in the year 1629, set forth a work by
the name of _Paradisus Terrestris_, wherein he gives the figures of all
such plants as are preserved in gardens, for the beauty of their
flowers, in use in meats or sauces; and also an orchard for all trees
bearing fruit, and such shrubs as for their beauty are kept in orchards
and gardens, with the ordering, planting, and preserving of all these.In this work he hath not superficially handled these things, but
accurately descended to the very varieties in each species, wherefore I
have now and then referred my reader, addicted to these delights, to
this work, especially in flowers and fruits, wherein I was loth to spend
too much time, especially seeing I could adde nothing to what he had
done upon that subject before."Hartlib (says Worlidge) tells you of the benefits of _orchard
fruits_, that they afford curious walks for pleasure, food for cattle in
the spring, summer, and winter, (meaning under their shadow,) fewel for
the fire, shade for the heat, physick for the sick, refreshment for the
sound, plenty of food for man, and that not of the worst, and drink also
of the best."Milton also in the above Tractate thus speaks:--"In those vernal seasons
of the year, when the air is calm and pleasant, it were an injury and
sullenness against nature, not to go out and see her riches, and partake
in her rejoicing with heaven and earth."[32] In the above tract of Dr.Beale's, he thus breaks out in praise of
the Orchards of this _deep and rich_ county:--"From the greatest person
to the poorest cottager, all habitations are encompassed with orchards,
and gardens, and in most places our hedges are enriched with rows of
fruit trees, pears or apples.All our villages, and generally all our
highways, (all our vales being thick set with rows of villages), are in
the spring time sweetened and beautified with the blossomed trees, which
continue their changeable varieties of ornament, till (in the end of
autumn), they fill our garners with pleasant fruit, and our cellars with
rich and winy liquors.Orchards, being the pride of our county, do not
only sweeten, but also purify the ambient air, which I conceive to
conduce very much to the constant health and long lives for which our
county hath always been famous.We do commonly devise a shadowy walk
from our gardens, through our orchards (which is the richest, sweetest,
and most embellished grove) into our coppice woods, or timber woods."Beale does not praise the whole of their land.He describes some as
"starvy, chapt, and cheany, as the basest land upon the Welch
mountains."He makes amends, however, for this, for he describes the
nags bred on their high grounds, as very different from our present
hackney-coach horses; they "are airey and sinewy, full of spirits and
vigour, in shape like the _barbe_, they rid ground, and gather courage
and delight in their own speed."[33] A Lady Gerard is mentioned in two letters of Mr.Pope, to W.
Fortescue, Esq.They appear in Polwhele's
History of Devonshire."I have just received a note from Mrs.Blount,
that she and Lady Gerard will dine here to-day."And "Lady Gerard was to
see Chiswick Gardens (as I imagined) and therefore forced to go from
hence by five; it was a mortification to Mrs.Blount to go, when there
was a hope of seeing you and Mr.There are three more
letters, without date, to Martha Blount, written from the Wells at
Bristol, and from Stowe, in which Pope says, "I have no more room but to
give Lady Gerard my hearty services."And "once more my services to Lady
Gerard.""I desire you will write a post-letter to my man John, at what
time you would have the pine apples, to send to Lady Gerard."Probably
Martha Blount's Lady Gerard was a descendant of Rea's.[34] A most curious account of the _Tulipomania_, or rage for tulips,
formerly in Holland, may be seen in Phillips's Flora Historica.[35] Perhaps no one more truly painted rich pastoral scenes than Isaac
Walton.This occurs in many, many pages of his delightful _Angler_.The
late ardently gifted, and most justly lamented Sir Humphry Davy too, in
his _Salmonia_, has fondly caught the charms of Walton's pages.His pen
riots in the wild, the beautiful, the sweet, delicious scenery of
nature:--"how delightful in the early spring, to wander forth by some
clear stream, to see the leaf bursting from the purple bud, to scent the
odours of the bank, perfumed by the violet, and enamelled as it were
with the primrose, and the daisy; to wander upon the fresh turf below
the shade of trees, whose bright blossoms are filled with the music of
the bee."Worlidge, in his Systema Agriculturae, says, that the
delights in angling "rouzes up the ingenious early in the spring
mornings, that they have the benefit of the sweet and pleasant morning
air, which many through sluggishness enjoy not; so that health (the
greatest treasure that mortals enjoy) and pleasure, go hand in hand in
this exercise.What can be more said of it, than that the most
ingenious, most use it."Whately, in his usual charming style, thus
paints the spring:--"Whatever tends to animate the scene, accords with
the season, which is full of youth and vigour, fresh and sprightly,
brightened by the verdure of the herbage, and the woods, gay with
blossoms, and flowers, and enlivened by the songs of the birds in all
their variety, from the rude joy of the skylark, to the delicacy of the
nightingale."[36] Tusser seems somewhat of Meager's opinion:--

   Sow peason and beans, in the wane of the moon,
   Who soweth them sooner, he soweth too soon;
   That they with the planet may rest and arise,
   And flourish, with bearing most plentifull wise.The celebrated Quintinye says, "I solemnly declare, that after a
diligent observation of the moon's changes for thirty years together,
and an enquiry whether they had any influence in gardening, the
affirmative of which has been so long established among us, I perceive
it was no weightier than old wives' tales."Mavor) having an influence on the tides and the
weather, she was formerly supposed to extend her power over all nature.There is a treatise, by _Claude Gadrois_, on the _Influences des
Astres_.Surely this merits perusal, when the Nouv.thus
speaks of him:--"Il etoit ami du celebre Arnauld et meritoit de l'etre
par _la justesse de son esprit_ et la purete de ses moeurs, par la bonte
de son caractere et par la droiture de son coeur."The following wise experiment occurs in an ancient book on husbandry;
but if the two parties there mentioned had lived with Leonard Meager,
one must not do him the injustice of supposing he would have been a
convert to their opinion:--"_Archibius_ is said to have written (or sent
word most likely) to _Antiochus_, king of _Syria_, that if you bury a
speckled toad inclosed in an earthen pot, in the middle of your garden,
the same will be defended from all hurtful weather and tempests."Meager, however, is kept in countenance by Mr.Worlidge, who, in his
chapter of Prognostics, at the end of his interesting Systemae
Agriculturae, actually states that

If dog's guts rumble and make a noise, it presageth rain or snow.The cat, by washing her face, and putting her foot over her ear,
foreshews rain.The squeaking and skipping up and down of mice and rats, portend rain.Leonard Meager thus notices a nurseryman of his day:--"Here follows a
catalogue of divers sorts of fruits, which I had of my very loving
friend, Captain Garrle, dwelling at the great nursery between
Spittlefields and Whitechapel; a very eminent and ingenious nurseryman."Perhaps this is the same nurseryman that Rea, in his _Pomona_, mentions.He says (after naming some excellent pear-trees) "they may be had out of
the nurseries about London, especially those of Mr.Leonard _Girle_, who will faithfully furnish such as desire these,
or any other kinds of rare fruit-trees, of whose fidelity in the
delivery of right kinds, I have had long experience in divers
particulars, a virtue not common to men of that profession."At this
period, the space between Spittlefields and Whitechapel, must have
consisted of gardens, and perhaps superb country houses.The Earl of
Devonshire had a fine house and garden near Petticoat-lane.Sir W.
Raleigh had one near Mile-end.Some one (I forget the author) says, "On
both sides of this lane (Petticoat-lane) were anciently hedges and rows
of elm trees, and the pleasantness of the neighbouring fields induced
several gentlemen to build their houses here; among whom was the Spanish
Ambassador, whom Strype supposes was Gondamour."Gondamour was the
person to please whom (or rather that James might the more easily marry
his son Charles to one of the daughters of Spain, with her immense
fortune) this weak monarch was urged to sacrifice the life of Raleigh.Within one's own memory, it is painful to reflect, on the many pleasant
fields, neat paddocks, rural walks, and gardens, (breathing pure air)
that surrounded this metropolis for miles, and miles, and which are now
ill exchanged for an immense number of new streets, many of them the
receptacles only of smoke and unhealthiness.[37] These lines are from him, at whose death (says Sir W. Scott in his
generous and glowing eulogy) we were stunned "by one of those
death-notes which are peeled at intervals, as from an archangel's
trumpet"--they are from "that mighty genius which walked amongst men as
something superior to ordinary mortality, and whose powers were beheld
with wonder, and something approaching to terror, as if we knew not
whether they were of good or evil"--they are from "that noble tree which
will never more bear fruit, or blossom!which has been cut down in its
strength, and the past is all that remains to us of Byron: whose
excellences will _now_ be universally acknowledged, and his faults (let
us hope and believe) not remembered in his epitaph."His "deep
transported mind" (to apply Milton's words to him) thus continues his
moralization:--

   What are the hopes of man?old Egypt's king
     CHEOPS, erected the first pyramid,
   And largest; thinking it was just the thing
     To keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;



   But somebody or other rummaging,
     Burglariously broke his coffin's lid:
   Let not a monument give you, or me, hopes,
   Since not a pinch of dust remains of CHEOPS.The Quarterly Review, in reviewing Light's Travels, observes, that
"Cheops employed three hundred and sixty thousand of his subjects for
twenty years in raising this pyramid, or pile of stones, equal in weight
to six millions of tons; and to render his precious dust more secure,
the narrow chamber was made accessible only by small intricate passages,
obstructed by stones of an enormous weight, and so carefully closed,
externally, as not to be perceptible.Yet how vain are all the
precautions of man!Not a bone was left of Cheops, either in the stone
coffin, or in the vault, when Shaw entered the gloomy chamber."Sir
Walter Scott himself, has justly received many eulogies.Perhaps none
more heart-felt, than the effusion delivered at a late Celtic meeting,
by that eloquent and honest lawyer, the present Lord Chief Justice of
the Court of Exchequer, in Scotland, which was received by long, loud,
and continued applause.[38] John Bauhine wrote a Treatise in 1591, De Plantis a Divis sanctisve
nomen habentibus.has this observation: "Plants, when
taken from the places whence they derive their extraction, and planted
in others of different qualities, _betray such fondness for their native
earth_, that with great difficulty they are brought to thrive in
another; and in this it is that the florist's art consists; for _to
humour each plant_ with the soil, the sun, the shade, the degrees of
dryness or moisture, and the neighbourhood it delights in, (for there is
a natural antipathy between some plants, insomuch that they will not
thrive near one another) are things not easily attainable, but by a
length of study and application."[39] What these ruffles and lashes were, I know not.Perhaps the words
of Johnson may apply to them:--

   Fate never wounds more deep the generous heart,
   Than when a blockhead's insult points the dart.This mournful truth is every where confess'd,
   Slow rises worth, by poverty oppress'd.[40] Barnaby Gooche, in his Chapter on Gardens, calls the sun "the
captaine and authour of the other lights, _the very soule of the
world_."[41] A translation of De Lille's garden thus pleads:--

   Oh!by those shades, beneath whose evening bowers
   The village dancers tripp'd the frolic hours;
   By those deep tufts that show'd your fathers' tombs,
   Spare, ye profane, their venerable glooms!To violate their sacred age, beware,
   Which e'en the awe-struck hand of time doth spare.Whateley observes, that "The whole range of nature is open to
him, (the landscape gardener) from the parterre to the forest; and
whatever is agreeable to the senses, or the imagination, he may
appropriate to the spot he is to improve; it is a part of his business
to collect into one place, the delights which are generally dispersed
through different species of country."[43] At page 24 he says, "_Cato_, one of the most celebrated writers on
Husbandry and Gardening among the Romans, (who, as appears by his
Introduction, took the model of his precepts from the _Greeks_) in his
excellent Treatise _De Re Rustica_, has given so great an encomium on
the excellence and uses of this good plant, (the Brocoli) not only as to
its goodness in eating, but also in physick and pharmacy, that makes it
esteemed one of the best plants either the field or garden produces."[44] His Chapter on the Water-Works of the Ancient Romans, French, &c.
is charmingly written.Those who delight in the formation of rivers,
fountains, falls of water, or cascades, as decorations to their gardens,
may inspect this ingenious man's Hydrostatics.And another specimen of
his genius may be seen in the magnificent iron gateway now remaining at
_Leeswood_, near Mold, and of which a print is given in Pugh's _Cambria
Depicta_.[45] In this volume is a letter written to Switzer, from his "ingenious
friend Mr.Thomas Knowlton, Gardener to the Earl of Burlington, who, on
account of his own industry, and the opportunity he has had of being
educated under the late learned Dr.Sherrard, claims a very advanced
place in the list of Botanists."This letter is dated Lansborough, July,
1728.I insert part of this letter:--"I hope, Sir, you will excuse the
freedom I take in giving you my opinion, having always had a respect for
your endeavours in Husbandry and Gardening, ever since you commenced an
author.Your introduction to, and manner of handling those beloved
subjects, (the sale of which I have endeavoured to promote) is in great
esteem with me; being (as I think) the most useful of any that have been
wrote on these useful subjects.If on any subject, you shall hereafter
revise or write farther upon, any communication of mine will be useful
or serviceable to you, I shall be very ready to do it.I heartily wish
you success in whatever you undertake, as it tends to a publick good."Pulteney says of Knowlton, "His zeal for English Botany was
uncommonly great, and recommended him successfully to the learned
Botanists of this country.From Sir Hans Sloane, he received eminent
civilities."[46] few short notices occur of names formerly eminent in
gardening:--"My late ingenious and laborious friend, Mr._Oram_,
Nurseryman, of Brompton-lane.""That great virtuoso and encourager of gardening, Mr."Their beautiful aspects in pots, (the nonpareil) and the middle of a
desert, has been the glory of one of the most generous encouragers of
gardening this age has produced, I mean the Right Honourable the Lord
Castlemain.""The late noble and most publick spirited encourager of arts and
sciences, especially gardening, his Grace the Duke of Montague, at
Ditton.""The Elrouge Nectarine is also a native of our own, the name being the
reverse of _Gourle_, a famous Nurseryman at Hogsden, in King Charles the
Second's time, by whom it was raised."And speaking of the successful cultivation of vines in the open air, he
refers to the garden of a Mr._Rigaud_, near _Swallow-street_; and to
another great cultivator of the vine, "of whose friendship I have proof,
the Rev._Only_, of _Cottesmore_, in Rutland, some time since
deceased; one of the most curious lovers of gardening that this or any
other age has produced."This gentleman, in 1765, published "An Account
of the care taken in most civilized nations for the relief of the poor,
more particularly in the time of scarcity and distress;" 4to.I believe the same gentleman also published, in 1765, a Treatise "Of the
Price of Wheat."[47] Lord Bacon says, "Because the breath of flowers is far sweeter in
the air (where it comes and goes, like the warbling of musick) than in
the hand, therefore nothing is more fit for that delight, than to know
what be the flowers and plants that do best perfume the air."The Prince
de Ligne says,

   Je ne veux point avoir l'orgueilleuse tulipe;
   _L'odorat en jardin_ est mon premier principe.The translation of _Spectacle de la Nature_, a very pleasing work,
observes that "Flowers are not only intended to beautify the earth with
their shining colours, but the greatest part of them, in order to render
the entertainment more exquisite, diffuse a fragrance that perfumes all
the air around us; and it should seem as if they were solicitous to
_reserve their odours for the evening and morn_, when walking is most
agreeable; but their sweets are very faint during the heat of the day,
when we visit them the least."I must again trespass on the pages of the great Bacon, by briefly
shewing the _natural wildness_ he wishes to introduce into one part of
his garden:--"thickets, made only of sweet-briar and honeysuckle, and
some wild vine amongst, and the ground set with violets, strawberries,
and primroses; for these are sweet, and prosper in the shade."The dew or pearly drops that one sees in a morning on cowslips, remind
one of what is said of Mignon:--"Ses ouvrages sont precieux par l'art
avec le quel il representoit les fleurs dans tout leur eclat, et les
fruits avec toute leur fraicheur.La rosee et les goutes d'eau qu'elle
repand sur les fleurs, sont si bien imitees dans ses tableaux, qu'on est
tente d'y porter la main."It is said also that in the works of
Van-Huysum, "le veloute des fruits, l'eclat des fleurs, le transparent
de la rosee, tout enchante dans les tableaux de ce peintre admirable."Sir U. Price observes of this latter painter, "that nature herself is
hardly more soft and delicate in her most delicate productions, than the
copies of them by Van-Huysum."Two flower pieces by this painter, sold
at the Houghton sale for 1200_l._

In the pieces of _Bos_, a Flemish painter, the dew was represented so
much like nature, as to deserve universal approbation.Bernazzano painted strawberries on a wall so naturally, that, we are
told, the plaster was torn down by the frequent pecking of peacocks.Amidst these celebrated painters, these admiring judges of nature, let
us not forget our never-dying Hogarth; his piercing eye even discovers
itself in his letter to Mr.Ellis, the naturalist:--"As for your pretty
little seed cups, or vases, they are a sweet confirmation of the
pleasure nature seems to take in superadding an elegance of form to most
of her works, wherever you find them.How poor and bungling are all the
inventions of art!"[48] The very numerous works of this indefatigable writer, embracing so
many subjects, make one think he must have been as careful of his time,
as the celebrated friend of the witty _Boileau_: the humane, benevolent,
and dignified Chancellor _Aguesseau_, who finding that his wife always
kept him waiting an hour after the dinner bell had rung, resolved to
devote this time to writing a work on Jurisprudence.He put this project
in execution, and in the course of time, produced a quarto work in four
thick volumes.[49] This chesnut tree is thus noticed in a newspaper of August,
1829:--"The celebrated chesnut tree, the property of Lord Ducie, at
Tortworth, in the county of Gloucester, is the oldest, if not the
largest tree in England, having this year attained the age of 1002
years, and being 52 feet in circumference, and yet retains so much
vigour, that it bore nuts so lately as two years ago, from which young
trees are now being raised."published in 1717, called the "Lady's Recreation,"
by _Charles_ Evelyn, Esq.There are two letters subjoined, written to
this author by the Rev.From page 103, 105, 129 and 141,
one should think this was not the son of the famous Mr.Lawrence, in the Preface to his Kalendar, inserted at the
end of his fifth edition, assures the public, "that the book called the
Lady's Recreation could not be published by my approbation, because it
was never seen by me till it was in print; besides, I have reason to
think it was an artifice of the booksellers to impose upon the world,
under the borrowed name of Evelyn."[51] This sermon was preached for several years by Dr.Colin Milne, by
whom it was published in 1799, and afterwards by the Rev.Ellis, of
Merchant Taylors' School.Ellis, in his History of Shoreditch, gives
us much information as to this bequest; in which the handsome conduct of
Mr.Denne, a former vicar, is not the least interesting.of his Literary Anecdotes, bears testimony to Dr.Denne's
feeling towards the poor and distressed, and to his attachment to
literary pursuits.Three of these Sermons are in the second volume of
"Thirty Sermons on Moral and Religious Subjects, by the Rev.W. Jones, of Nayland, his Theological, Philosophical,
and Miscellaneous Works, with Life, 12 vols._neat_, 7_l._ 7_s._
6_d._ 1801.William Jones, of Nayland, Suffolk:
Chaplain to the Right Rev.George Horne, Bishop of Norwich; 1 vol.with Portrait of the Author, price 12_s._ Dove, St.John's Square,
Printer, 1828."Of this faithful servant of God, (the Rev.W. Jones) I
can speak both from personal knowledge and from his writings.He was a
man of quick penetration, of extensive learning, and the soundest piety;
and he had, beyond any other man I ever knew, the talent of writing upon
the deepest subjects to the plainest understandings."--_Bishop Horsley's
Charges._ The Rev.Samuel Ayscough, of the British Museum, began, in
1790, to preach this annual sermon, and, I believe, continued it for
fourteen years.Ellis, of _Little Gaddesden_, in his Practical Farmer, 8vo.1732, thus speaks on this subject:--"What a charming sight is a large
tree in blossom, and after that, when loaden with fruit, enough perhaps
to make a hogshead of cyder or perry!A scene of beauty, hopes, and
profit, and all!It may be on less than two feet diameter of ground.And
above all, what matter of contemplation does it afford, when we let our
thoughts descend to a single kernel of an apple or pear?And again, how
heightened, on the beholding so great a bulk raised and preserved, by
Omnipotent Power, from so small a body."[53] The thought of planting the sides of public roads, was first
suggested by the great _Sully_.Weston, in his introduction to these Tracts, seems to have
pleasure in recording the following anecdote of La Quintinye, from
Harte's Essay."The famous La Quintinie, director of the royal gardens
in France, obtained from Louis XIV.an abbacy for his son, in one of the
remote provinces; and going soon afterwards to make the abbot a visit,
(who was not then settled in his apartments) he was entertained and
lodged by a neighbouring gentleman with great friendliness and
hospitality.La Quintinie, as was natural, soon examined the gardens of
his host; he found the situation beautiful, and the soil excellent; but
every thing was rude, savage, and neglected: nature had done much, art
nothing.The guest, delighted with his friendly reception, took leave
with regret, and some months after, sent one of the king's gardeners,
and four under-gardeners, to the gentleman, with strict command to
accept of no gratuity.They took possession of his little inclosure the
moment they arrived, and having digged it many times over, they manured,
replanted it, and left one of their number behind them, as a settled
servant in the family.This young man was soon solicited to assist the
neighbourhood, and filled their kitchen gardens and fruit gardens with
the _best_ productions of every kind, which are preserved and propagated
to this very hour."_Perrault_, in
his _Hommes Illustres_, has given his Life, and Portrait.Gibson, in
his Fruit Gardener, calls him "truly an original author;" and further
pays him high compliments.thus speaks of him:--"Il vint a Paris se faire
recevoir avocat.Une eloquence naturelle, cultivee avec soin, le fit
briller dans le Barreau, et lui consila l'estime des premiers
magistrais.Quoi qu'il eut peu de temps dont il put disposer, il en
trouvoit neanmoins suffisament pour satisfaire la passion qu'il avoit
pour l'agriculture.Il augmenta ses connoissances sur le jardinage, dans
un voyage qu'il fit en Italie.De retour a Paris, il se livra tout
entier a l'agriculture, et fit un grand nombre d'experiences curieuses
et utiles.Le grand Prince de _Conde_, qui aimoit l'agriculture, prenoit
une extreme plaisir a s'entretenir avec lui; et Charles II.Roi
d'Angleterre lui offrit une pension considerable pour l'attacher a la
culture de ses Jardins, mais il refusa ses offres avantageuses par
l'amour qu'il avoit pour sa patrie, et trouva en France les recompenses
due a son merite.On a de lui un excellent livre, intitule 'Instructions
pour les Jardins Fruitiers et Potagers, Paris, 1725, 2 tom._et
plusieurs Lettres sur la meme matiere_."Switzer, in his History of
Gardening, says, that in Mons.de la Quintinye's "Two Voyages into
England, he gained considerable friendship with several lords with whom
he kept correspondence by letters till his death, and these letters,
says Perrault, are all _printed at London_."And he afterwards says,
speaking of Lord Capel's garden at Kew, "the greatest advance made by
him herein, was the bringing over several sorts of fruits from France;
and this noble lord we may suppose to be one that held for many years a
correspondence with Mons.Such letters on such
correspondence if ever printed, must be worth perusal.[55] Lamoignon de Malherbes (that excellent man) had naturalized a vast
number of foreign trees, and at the age of eighty-four, saw every where,
in France, (as Duleuze observes) plants of his own introduction.The old Earl of _Tweedale_, in the reign of Charles II.and his
immediate successor, planted more than six thousand acres, in Scotland,
with fir trees.In a Tour through Scotland, in 1753, it mentions, that
"The county of Aberdeen is noted for its timber, having in it upwards of
five millions of fir trees, besides vast numbers of other kinds, planted
within these seventy years, by the gentry at and about their seats."Marshall, in his "Planting and Rural Ornament," states, that "In
1792, his Grace the Duke of Athol (we speak from the highest authority)
was possessed of a thousand larch trees, then growing on his estates of
Dunkeld and Blair only, of not less than two to four tons of timber
each; and had, at that time, a million larches, of different sizes,
rising rapidly on his estate."The zeal for planting in Scotland, of late years, has been stimulated by
the writings of James Anderson, and Lord Kames.It is pleasing to transcribe the following paragraph from a newspaper of
the year 1819:--"Sir Watkin Williams Wynn has planted, within the last
five years, on the mountainous lands in the vicinity of Llangollen,
situated from 1200 to 1400 feet above the level of the sea, 80,000 oaks,
63,000 Spanish chesnuts, 102,000 spruce firs, 110,000 Scotch firs,
90,000 larches, 30,000 wych elms, 35,000 mountain elms, 80,000 ash, and
40,000 sycamores, all of which are, at this time, in a healthy and
thriving condition."It is impossible, on this subject, to avoid paying
a grateful respect to the memory of that bright ornament of our church,
and literature, the late Dr.Watson, Bishop of Llandaff, whose extensive
plantations, near Ambleside, have long since enriched that part.The
late Richard Crawshay (surpassed by no being during the whole course of
his very long life, for either integrity or generosity) assured the
present writer, that during an early period of Dr.Watson's planting, he
offered him, on the security of his note of hand only, and to be repaid
at his own entire convenience, ten thousand pounds, and that he (with
grateful thanks to Mr.[56] How widely different has the liberal and classic mind of Dr.Alison
viewed the rich pages of Mr.Whateley, in his deep and learned Essays on
Taste, first published nearly twenty years after Mr.One regrets that there is no Portrait of Mr.Alison,
there is a masterly one by Sir Henry Raeburn, admirably engraved by W.
Walker, of Edinburgh, in 1823.Perhaps it is one of the finest Portraits
of the present day.One is happy to perceive marks of health expressed
in his intellectually striking countenance.[57] In Biographical Anecdotes, 3 vols.appears a correspondence in
London, with Dr.Franklin, and William Whateley, and Joseph Whateley, in
1774.Temple, by a brother of Thomas
Whateley.Franklin, it appears, that
inflammatory and ill-judged letters were written by George Hutchinson,
and others, to _Thomas_ Whateley, Esq._private Secretary to Lord
Grenville_, respecting some disturbances in America, concerning Lord
Grenville's Stamp Act.On the death of Thomas, these letters were placed
in the hands of Dr.Franklin, whose duty, as agent to the colony, caused
him to transmit them to Boston.A quarrel arose between William Whateley
and Mr.Temple, as to which of them gave up those letters, and a duel
was fought.Franklin immediately cleared both those gentlemen from
all imputation.Of the celebrated interview in the council chamber,
between Mr.Franklin, an account is given by Dr.page 1. of the Monthly Magazine, and which candid
account entirely acquits Dr.Franklin from having deserved the rancorous
political acrimony of Mr.Wedderburn, whose intemperate language is
fully related in some of the Lives of Dr.Franklin, and in his Life,
published and sold by G. Nicholson, _Stourport_, 12mo.Lord Chatham spoke of Franklin in the highest strain of panegyric, when
adverting, in the year 1777, to his dissuasive arguments against the
American war.William Whateley was administrator of the goods and chattels of his
brother Thomas, who, of course, died without a will.and Political Tracts, the nineteenth
chapter consists of his account of two _Political_ Tracts, by Thomas
Whateley, Esq.and he thus concludes this chapter:--"Mr.Whateley also
wrote a tract on laying out pleasure grounds."is an
account of the quarrel and duel with Mr.It appears that Thomas Whateley died in June, 1772, and left two
brothers, William and Joseph.Debrett published "Scarce Tracts," in 4 vols.i. is one
called "The Budget," by D. Hartley, Esq.This same volume contains a
reply to this, viz."Remarks on the Budget, by Thomas Whateley, Esq.another tract by
Thomas Whateley, Esq.entitled "Considerations on the Trade and Finances
of the Kingdom."These two pamphlets, upon subjects so very different
from the alluring one on landscape gardening, and his unfinished one on
Shakspeare, convinces us, what a powerful writer he would have been, had
his life been longer spared.[58] The reader will be amply gratified by perusing page 158 of the late
Sir U. Price's well known Letter to Mr.Morris's
Observations on Water, as regards Ornamental Scenery; inserted in the
Gardener's Magazine for May, 1827.Whateley's distinction between a
river, a rivulet, and a rill, form, perhaps, five of the most seductive
pages of his book.Our own Shakspeare's imagery on this subject, should
not be overlooked:--

   The current that with gentle murmur glides,
   Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;
   But when his fair course is not hindered,
   He makes sweet music with the enamelled stones,
   Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
   He overtaketh in his pilgrimage:
   And so by many winding nooks he strays
   With willing sport to the wild ocean.[59] The benevolent mind of the marquis shines even in his concluding
chapter; for he there wishes "to bring us back to a true taste for
beautiful nature--to more humane and salutary regulations of the
country--to produce the _moral_ landscapes which delight the mind.His
view of the good mother, seeing her children playing round her at their
cottage, near the common, thus "endearing her home, and making even the
air she breathed more delightful to her, make these sort of commons, to
me, the most delightful of _English gardens_.The dwellings of the happy
and peaceful husbandmen would soon rise up in the midst of compact
farms.Can there exist a more delightful habitation for man, than a neat
farm-house in the centre of a pleasing landscape?There avoiding disease
and lassitude, useless expence, the waste of land in large and dismal
parks, and above all, by preventing misery, and promoting happiness, we
shall indeed have gained the prize of having united the agreeable with
the useful.Perhaps, when every folly is exhausted, there will come a
time, in which men will be so far enlightened as to prefer the real
pleasures of nature to vanity and chimera."[60] Perhaps it may gratify those who seek for health, by their
attachment to gardens, to note the age that some of our English
horticulturists have attained to:--Parkinson died at about 78;
Tradescant, the father, died an old man; Switzer, about 80; Sir Thomas
Browne died at 77; Evelyn, at 86; Dr.Beale, at 80; Jacob Bobart, at 85;
Collinson, at 75; a son of Dr.Lawrence (equally fond of gardens as his
father) at 86; Bishop Compton, at 81; Bridgman, at an advanced age;
Knowlton, gardener to Lord Burlington, at 90; Miller, at 80; James Lee,
at an advanced age; Lord Kames, at 86; Abercrombie, at 80; the Rev.Gilpin, at 80; Duncan, a gardener, upwards of 90; Hunter, who published
_Sylva_, at 86; Speechley, at 86; Horace Walpole, at 80; Mr.Bates, the
celebrated and ancient horticulturist of High Wickham, who died there in
December, 1819, at the great age of 89; Marshall, at an advanced age;
Sir Jos.Banks, at 77; Joseph Cradock, at 85; James Dickson, at 89; Dr.Andrew Duncan, at 83; and Sir U. Price, at 83.Loudon, at page 1063
of his Encyclop.inform us, that a market garden, and nursery, near
Parson's Green, had been, for upwards of two centuries, occupied by a
family of the name of Rench; that one of them (who instituted the first
annual exhibition of flowers) died at the age of ninety-nine years,
having had thirty-three children; and that his son (mentioned by
Collinson, as famous for forest trees) introduced the moss-rose, planted
the elm trees now growing in the Bird-cage Walk, St.James's Park, from
trees reared in his own nursery, married two wives, had thirty-five
children, and died in 1783, in the same room in which he was born, at
the age of a hundred and one years.Reflecting on the great age of some
of the above, reminds me of what a "Journal Encyclopedique" said of
Lestiboudois, another horticulturist and botanist, who died at Lille, at
the age of ninety, and who (for even almost in our ashes _live their
wonted fires_) gave lectures in the very last year of his life."When he
had (says an ancient friend of his) but few hours more to live, he
ordered snow-drops, violets, and crocuses, to be brought to his bed, and
compared them with the figures in Tournefort.His whole existence had
been consecrated to the good of the public, and to the alleviation of
misery; thus he looked forward to his dissolution with a tranquillity of
soul that can only result from a life of rectitude; he never acquired a
fortune; and left no other inheritance to his children, but integrity
and virtue."[61] About eighty years previous to Hyll's Treatise on Bees, Rucellai,
an Italian of distinction, who aspired to a cardinal's hat, and who
laboured with zeal and taste (I am copying from De Sismondi's View of
the Literature of the South of Europe) to render Italian poetry
classical, or a pure imitation of the ancients, published his most
celebrated poem on Bees."It receives (says De Sismondi) a particular
interest from the real fondness which Rucellai seems to have entertained
for these creatures.There is something so sincere in his respect for
their virgin purity, and in his admiration of the order of their
government, that he inspires us with real interest for them.All his
descriptions are full of life and truth."[62] Ben Jonson, in his _Discourses_, gives the following eulogy on this
illustrious author:--"No member of his speech but consisted of his own
graces.His hearers could not cough or look aside from him without loss.He commanded where he spoke, and had his judges angry and pleased at his
devotion: no man had their affections more in his power; the fear of
every man that heard him was, lest he should make an end."Loudon,
when treating on the study of plants, observes, that "This wonderful
philosopher explored and developed the true foundations of human
knowledge, with a sagacity and penetration unparalleled in the history
of mankind."applied to the eight books of Hooker's
Ecclesiastical Polity, may well apply to the writings of Bacon:--"there
is no learning that this man hath not searched into.His books will get
reverence by age, for there is in them such seeds of eternity, that they
will continue till the last fire shall devour all learning."Monsieur
Thomas, in his Eulogy of Descartes, says, "Bacon explored every path of
human knowledge, he sat in judgment on past ages, and anticipated those
that were to come."The reader will be gratified by inspecting the
second volume of Mr.Malone's publication of Aubrey's Letters, in the
Bodleian Library, as well as the richly decorated and entertaining
Beauties of England and Wales, and Pennant's Tour from Chester to
London, for some curious notices of the ancient mansion, garden, and
orchard, at Gorhambury.[63] The reader will be amply gratified by Mr.Johnson's review of the
general state of horticulture at this period, in his History of English
Gardening, and with the zeal with which he records the attachment of
James I. and Charles, to this science; and where, in a subsequent
chapter, he glances on the progress of our Botany, and proudly twines
round the brows of the modest, but immortal, Ray, a most deserved and
generous wreath.[64] I subjoin a few extracts from the first book of his English
Husbandman, 4to.1635:--"A garden is so profitable, necessary, and such
an ornament and grace to every house and housekeeper, that the
dwelling-place is lame and maimed if it want that goodly limbe, and
beauty.I do not wonder either at the worke of art, or nature, when I
behold in a goodly, rich and fertill soyle, a garden adorned with all
the delights and delicacies which are within man's understanding,
because the naturall goodnesse of the earth (which not enduring to bee
idle) will bring forth whatsoever is cast into her; but when I behold
upon a barren, dry, and dejected earth, such as the Peake-hills, where a
man may behold snow all summer, or on the East-mores, whose best herbage
is nothing but mosse, and iron-stone, in such a place, I say, to behold
a delicate, rich, and fruitful garden, it shewes great worthinesse in
the owner, and infinite art and industry in the workeman, and makes mee
both admire and love the begetters of such excellencies."And again,--"For the situation of the garden-plot for pleasure, you
shall understand, that it must ever bee placed so neare unto the
dwelling-house as it is possible, both because the eye of the owner may
be a guard and support from inconveniences, as all that the especial
roomes and prospects of the house may be adorned, perfumed, and inriched
with the delicate proportions, odoriferous smells, and wholesome airs
which shall ascend and vaporate from the same."He then gives a variety of cuts of knots and mazes, and labyrinths, of
which he observes, that "many other adornations and beautifyings there
are, which belong to the setting forth of a curious garden, but for as
much as none are more rare or more esteemed than these I have set down,
being the best ornaments of the best gardens of this kingdome, I think
them tastes sufficient for every husbandman or other of better quality,
which delighteth in the beauty, and well trimming of his ground."He
thus remarks:--"as in the composition of a delicate woman, the grace of
her cheeke is the mixture of red and white, the wonder of her eye blacke
and white, and the beauty of her hand blew and white, any of which is
not said to be beautifull if it consist of single or simple colours; and
so in these walkes or alleyes the all greene, nor the all yellow cannot
be said to bee most beautifull, but the greene and yellow, (that is to
say, the untroade grasse, and the well knit gravell) being equally mixt,
give the eye both luster and delight beyond all comparison."His description of the following flower is singular: "_The Crowne
Emperiall_, is, of all flowers, both forraigne and home-bred, the
delicatest, and strangest: it hath the true shape of an imperiall
crowne, and will be of divers colours, according to the art of the
gardener.In the middest of the flower you shall see a round pearle
stand, in proportion, colour, and orientnesse, like a true naturall
pearle, only it is of a soft liquid substance: this pearle, if you shake
the flower never so violently, will not fall off, neyther if you let it
continue never so long, will it eyther encrease or diminish in the
bignesse, but remaineth all one: yet if with your finger you take and
wipe it away, in less than an hour after you shall have another arise in
the same place, and of the same bignesse.This pearle, if you taste it
upon your tongue, is pleasant, and sweet like honey: this flower when
the sunne ariseth, you shall see it looke directly to the east, with the
stalk bent lowe thereunto, and as the sunne ariseth higher and higher,
so the flower will likewise ascend, and when the sunne is come into the
meridian or noone poynt, which is directly over it, then will it stand
upright upon the stalke, and looke directly upward, and as the sunne
declineth, so will it likewise decline, and at the sunne setting looke
directly to the west only."His mention of another flower is attractive:--"Now for your _Wall
Gilliflower_, it delighteth in hard rubbish, limy, and stony grounds,
whence it commeth they covet most to grow upon walls, pavements, and
such like barraine places.It may be sowen in any moneth or season, for
it is a seed of that hardness, that it makes no difference betwixt
winter and summer, but will flourish in both equally, and beareth his
flowers all the yeere, whence it comes that the husbandman preserves it
most in his _bee-garden_, for it is _wondrous sweet_, and affordeth much
honey.It would be sowen in very small quantity, for after it hath once
taken roote, it will naturally of itself overspread much ground, and
hardly ever after be rooted out.It is of itselfe of so exceeding a
strong, and _sweet smell_, that it cannot be forced to take any other,
and therefore is ever preserved in its owne nature."of Gardening, fondly reviews the taste
for flowers which pervaded most ranks during the time of Elizabeth, and
Evelyn.The _Spectacle de la Nature_, of which we have a translation in 1740,
has a richly diffuse chapter on flowers.I here transcribe a small part
thereof:--

_Prior._ "The beauty of flowers never fails to inspire us with joy; and
when we have sufficiently examined the fairest, we are sensible they are
only proper to refresh the sight; and, indeed, the prospect they afford
is so touching, and we experience their power to be so effectual, that
the generality of those arts which are ambitious to please, seem most
successful when they borrow their assistance.Sculpture imitates them in
its softest ornaments; architecture bestows the embellishments of leaves
and festoons on those columns and fronts, which would otherwise be too
naked.The richest embroideries are little more than foliage and
flowers; the most magnificent silks are almost covered with these
charming forms, and are thought beautiful, in proportion as they
resemble the lively tinge of natural flowers."These have always been the symbols, or representations of joy; they
were formerly the inseparable ornaments of feasts, and are still
introduced with applause, toward the close of our entertainments, when
they are brought in with the fruit, to enliven the festival that begins
to languish.And they are so peculiarly adapted to scenes of pleasure,
that they are always considered as inconsistent with mourning.Decency,
informed by nature, never admits them into those places where tears and
affliction are predominant._Countess._ "The festivals in the country are never celebrated without
garlands, and the entertainments of the polite are ushered in by a
flower.If the winter denies them that gratification, they have recourse
to art.A young bride, in all the magnificence of her nuptial array,
would imagine she wanted a necessary part of her ornaments, if she did
not improve them with a sprig of flowers.A queen, amidst the greatest
solemnities, though she is covered with the jewels of the crown, has an
inclination to this rural ornament; she is not satisfied with mere
grandeur and majesty, but is desirous of assuming an air of softness and
gaiety, by the mediation of flowers._Prior._ "Religion itself, with all its simplicity and abstraction, and
amidst the abhorrence it professes to theatrical pomp, which rather
tends to dissipate the heart, than to inspire it with a due reverence
for sacred mysteries, and a sensibility of human wants, permits some of
its festivals to be celebrated with boughs, and chaplets of flowers."[66] In his Diary is the following entry:--"1658, 27 Jan.After six fits
of an ague, died my son Richard, five years and three days old onely,
but, at that tender age, a prodigy for witt and understanding; for
beauty of body, a very angel; for endowment of mind, of incredible and
rare hopes.He was all life, all prettinesse.What shall I say of his
frequent pathetical ejaculations uttered of himselfe: _Sweete Jesus,
save me, deliver me, pardon my sins, let thine angels receive me!_ So
early knowledge, so much piety and perfection!for such a child I blesse God in whose bosome he is!"Nanteuil's portrait is prefixed to his _Sylva_, 1664; and a fine copy of
the same, by Bartolozzi, is prefixed to Hunter's _Sylva_.Worlidge
engraved a fine portrait of him, prefixed to his _Sculptura_.Gaywood
engraved his portrait for the translation of _Lucretius_.In Walpole's
Anecdotes is his portrait, by Bannerman.[67] In "A Picturesque Promenade round Dorking," are selected many
interesting particulars of Mr.[68] Essex lost his head for having said that Elizabeth grew old and
cankered, and that her mind was as crooked as her carcase.Perhaps the
beauty of Mary galled Elizabeth.The Quarterly Review of July, 1828, thus remarks:--"When Elizabeth's
wrinkles waxed many, it is reported that an unfortunate master of the
Mint incurred disgrace, by a too faithful shilling; the die was broken,
and only one mutilated impression is now in existence.Her maids of
honour took the hint, and were thenceforth careful that no fragment of a
looking glass should remain in any room of the palace.In fact, the
lion-hearted lady had not heart to look herself in the face for the last
twenty years of her life."She loved Essex, of all
men, best; and yet the same axe which murdered Anne Bulleyn, was used to
revenge herself on him.The bloody task took three strokes, which so
enraged the multitude, (who loved Essex) that they would have torn the
executioner to pieces, had not the soldiers prevented them.Hutton,
in his "Journey to London," observes, that "their vengeance ought to
have been directed against the person who caused him to use it."What
her reflections were on these two bloody acts when on her death-bed, we
scarcely know.A modern writer on horticulture, nearly concludes a very
pleasing work, by enumerating (with slight historical notices) the
several plants cultivated in our gardens.He thus concludes his account
of one:--"Queen Elizabeth, in her last illness, eat little but Succory
Pottage."Loudon says it is used "as a fodder for cattle."The
French call it Chicoree _sauvage_.Her taste must have been something
like her heart.Poor Mary eat no supper the night previous to _her_ last
illness.Had it been possible for Elizabeth to have read those pages of
Robertson, which paint the long succession of calamities which befel
Mary, and the insolence and brutality she received from Darnley, and
which so eloquently plead for her frailties, perhaps even these pages
would not have softened her bloody disposition, which she seems to have
inherited from that insolent monster, her father."Mary's sufferings
(says this enchanting historian) exceed, both in degree and duration,
those tragical distresses which fancy has feigned, to excite sorrow and
commiseration; and while we survey them, we are apt altogether to forget
her frailties; we think of her faults with less indignation, and approve
of our tears as if they were shed for a person who had attained much
nearer to pure virtue.With regard to the queen's person, all
contemporary authors agree in ascribing to Mary the utmost beauty of
countenance, and elegance of shape, of which the human form is capable.Her hair was black, though, according to the fashion of that age, she
frequently borrowed locks, and of different colours.Her eyes were a
dark grey; her complexion was exquisitely fine, and her hands and arms
remarkably delicate, both as to shape and colour.Her stature was of an
height that rose to the majestic.She danced, she walked, and she rode
with equal grace.She sung, and played upon the lute with uncommon
skill."[69] I will merely give this brief extract as one out of many of great
force and beauty, from his _Salmonia_:--"If we look with wonder upon the
great remains of human works, such as the columns of Palmyra, broken in
the midst of the desert, the temples of Paestum, beautiful in the decay
of twenty centuries, or the mutilated fragments of Greek sculpture in
the Acropolis of Athens, or in our own Museum, as proofs of the genius
of artists, and power and riches of nations now past away, with how much
deeper feeling of admiration must we consider those grand monuments of
nature, which mark the revolutions of the globe; continents broken into
islands; one land produced, another destroyed; the bottom of the ocean
become a fertile soil; whole races of animals extinct; and the bones and
exuviae of one class covered with the remains of another, and upon the
graves of past generations--the marble or rocky tomb, as it were, of a
former animated world--new generations rising, and order and harmony
established, and a system of life and beauty produced, as it were, out
of chaos and death; proving the infinite power, wisdom, and goodness, of
the GREAT CAUSE OF ALL BEING!"I must trespass on my reader, by again
quoting from _Salmonia_:--"I envy no quality of the mind or intellect in
others; not genius, power, wit, or fancy; but if I could choose what
would be most delightful, and I believe most useful to me, I should
prefer _a firm religious belief_ to every other blessing; for it makes
life a discipline of goodness--creates new hopes, when all earthly hopes
vanish; and throws over the decay, the destruction of existence, the
most gorgeous of lights; awakens life even in death, and from corruption
and decay calls up beauty and divinity: makes an instrument of torture
and of shame the ladder of ascent to Paradise; and, far above all
combinations of earthly hopes, calls up the most delightful visions of
palms and amaranths, the gardens of the blest, the security of
everlasting joys, where the sensualist and the sceptic view only gloom,
decay, annihilation, and despair!"[70] In this delightful essay, he says, "the most exquisite delights of
sense are pursued, in the contrivance and plantation of gardens, which,
with fruits, flowers, shades, fountains, and the music of birds that
frequent such happy places, seem to furnish all the pleasures of the
several senses."Johnson, in his History of English Gardening, admirably
confirms this conflagration argument, by quoting the opinion or
testimony of the celebrated Goethe.[72] To this interesting subject is devoted, a part of Mr.Loudon's
concise and luminous review "Of the Rise, Progress, and Present State of
Gardening in the British Isles;" being chapter iv.[73] Perhaps there are few pages that more awfully paint the sacredness
of this spot, than page 36 in the fifth edition of Dr.[74] I do not mean to apply to the hospitable table of this reverend
gentleman, the lines of Peter Pindar:--

   One cut from _venison_, to the heart can speak,
   Stronger than ten quotations from the _Greek_.[75] I cannot prevent myself from quoting a very small portion of the
animated address of another clergyman, the Rev.J. G. Morris, as
chairman to the Wakefield Horticultural Society.I am certain each one
of my readers will blame me for not having inserted the whole of this
eloquent appeal.I copy it from the Gardener's Magazine for August,
1828:--"Conscious that I possessed no qualifications to fit me for the
task, and feeling that it ill became me to assume it, as I am as yet
nearly a stranger amongst you; aware, too, that I should be surrounded
by individuals so much more eligible, inasmuch as they are eminently
gifted with botanical science and practical knowledge, the result of
their horticultural pursuits and facilities, of which I am quite devoid;
I wished and begged to decline the proffered honour.It appears,
however, that my entreaties are not listened to, and that your kindness
and partiality persist in selecting for your chairman one so inadequate
to the situation.Gentlemen, I take the chair with much diffidence; but
I will presume to say, that, in the absence of other qualities, I bring
with me a passionate love for plants and flowers, for the sweets and
beauties of the garden, and no inconsiderable fondness for its more
substantial productions.Gardening, as a recreation and relaxation from
severer studies and more important avocations, has exquisite charms for
me; and I am ready, with old _Gerarde_, to confess, that 'the principal
delight is in the mind, singularly enriched with the knowledge of these
visible things; setting forth to us the invisible wisdom and admirable
workmanship of Almighty God.'With such predilections, you will easily
give me credit, gentlemen, for participating with this assembly in the
sincerest wishes for the complete and permanent establishment of a
society amongst us, whose object shall be to promote, in the surrounding
district, the introduction of different sorts of flowers, culinary
vegetables, fruits, improved culture and management generally, and _a
taste_ for botany as a science.These are pursuits, gentlemen, combining
at once health and innocence, pleasure and utility.Wakefield and its
vicinity appear to possess facilities for the accomplishment of such a
project, inferior to no district within this great palatinate, indeed,
little inferior to any in the kingdom.The country is beautiful and
charmingly varied, and, from the diversity of soil, suited to varied
productions; the whole thickly interspersed with seats and villas of
persons of opulence, possessing their conservatories, hot-houses, and
stoves, their orchards, flower and kitchen gardens: whilst few towns can
boast (as Wakefield can) of so many gardens within its enclosure,
cultivated with so much assiduity and skill, so much taste and deserved
success.Seven years ago, I had the honour to originate a similar
project in Preston, in Lancashire, and with the happiest success.In
that borough, possessing far less advantages than Wakefield offers, a
horticultural society was established, which, in its four annual
meetings, assembles all the rank and fashion of a circuit of more than
ten miles, and numbers more than a hundred and twenty subscribers to its
funds.Those who have not witnessed the interesting sight, can form but
a faint idea of the animating scene which is presented in a spacious and
handsome room, tastefully adorned with the choicest exotics from various
conservatories, and the more choice, because selected with a view to
competition: decorated with the varied beauties of the parterre, vieing
with each other in fragrance, hue, and delicacy of texture; whilst the
tables groan under the weight of delicious fruits and rare vegetables in
endless variety, the joint produce of hot-houses, stoves, orchards, and
kitchen gardens.Figure to yourselves, gentlemen, this elysium, graced
by some hundreds of our fair countrywomen, an absolute galaxy of
animated beauty, and that music lends its aid, and you will agree with
me that a more fascinating treat could hardly be devised.New flowers,
new fruits, recent varieties of those of long standing and established
character for excellence, are thus introduced, in lieu of those whose
inferiority is no longer doubtful.New culinary vegetables, or, from
superior treatment or mode of culture, rendered more salubrious and of
exquisite flavour, will load the stalls of our market-gardeners.I call
upon you, then, gentlemen, for your zealous support.Say not that you
have no gardens, or that your gardens are inconsiderable, or that you
are no cultivators; you are all interested in having good and delicious
fruits, nutritious and delicate culinary vegetables, and in procuring
them at a reasonable rate, which will be the results of improved and
successful cultivation.At our various exhibitions, let each contribute
that in which he excels, and our object will be attained.Gentlemen, I
fear I have trespassed too long on your patience and indulgence.I will
just urge one more motive for your warm support of our intended society;
it is this: that, by diffusing a love of plants and gardening, you will
materially contribute to the comfort and happiness of the laborious
classes; for the pleasure taken in such pursuits forms an
unexceptionable relaxation from the toils of business, and every hour
thus spent is subtracted from the ale-house and other haunts of idleness
and dissipation."[76] In the grounds of _Hagley_, were once inscribed these lines:--

   Here Pope!--ah, never must that tow'ring mind
   To his loved haunts, or dearer friend return;
   What art, what friendships!what fame resign'd:
   In yonder glade I trace his mournful urn.[77] At Holm-Lacey is preserved a sketch, in crayons, by Pope, (when on
a visit there) of Lord Strafford by Vandyke.It is well known that Pope
painted Betterton in oil colours, and gave it to Lord Mansfield.The
noble lord regretted the loss of this memorial, when his house was
consumed at the time of the disgraceful and ignorant riots.[78] Sir Joshua Reynolds used to tell the following anecdote relative to
Pope.--"When Reynolds was a young man, he was present at an auction of
very scarce pictures, which attracted a great crowd of _connoisseurs_
and others; when, in the moment of a very interesting piece being put
up, Mr.All was in an instant, from a scene of
confusion and bustle, a dead calm.The auctioneer, as if by instinct,
suspended his hammer.The audience, to an individual, as if by the same
impulse, rose up to receive the poet; and did not resume their seats
till he had reached the upper end of the room."A similar honour was paid to the Abbe Raynal, whose reputation was such,
that the Speaker of the House of Commons observing _him_ among the
spectators, suspended the business of the house till he had seen the
eloquent historian placed in a more commodious seat.It is painful to
relate, that this powerful writer, and good man, who narrowly escaped
the guillotine, expired in a garret, in extreme poverty, at the age of
eighty-four; the only property he left being one assignat of fifty
livres, worth not threepence in ready money.Perhaps one might have
applied the following anecdote (told by Dr.Drake in his Literary Hours)
to Abbe Raynal:--"A respectable character, having long figured in the
gay world at Paris, was at length compelled to live in an obscure
retreat in that city, the victim of severe misfortunes.He was so
indigent, that he subsisted only on an allowance from the parish.Every
week bread was sent to him sufficient for his support, and yet at
length, he demanded more.'With whom, sir, is it possible I should live?I am wretched, since I thus solicit charity, and am abandoned by all the
world.''But, sir, if you live alone, why do you ask for more bread than
is sufficient for yourself?'The other at last, with great reluctance,
confessed that he had a dog.The curate desired him to observe, that he
was only the distributor of the bread that belonged to the poor, and
that it was absolutely necessary that he should dispose of his dog.exclaimed the poor man, weeping, 'and if I lose my dog, who is
there then to love me?'The good pastor took his purse, and giving it to
him, 'take this, sir,' said he; 'this is mine--this I _can_ give.'"[79] How applicable are Gray's lines to Lord Byron himself, now!Can storied urn or animated bust
     Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?Can honour's voice provoke the silent dust,
     Or flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of death?Perhaps in this _neglected_ spot is laid
     Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire!--



[80] Mr.Bowles, in some stanzas written since the death of Byron, thus
feelingly apostrophizes his noble spirit:--

   But I will bid th' Arcadian cypress wave,
     Pluck the green laurel from Peneus' side,
   And pray thy spirit may such quiet have
     That not one thought unkind be murmur'd o'er thy grave.[81] Perhaps one motive (no doubt there were numberless others) that
_might_ have induced Mr.Mason thus to honour the memory of Pope,

   ----_letting cold tears bedew his silver urn_,

_might_ have been from the recollection of his attachment to what
equally charmed Mr.[82] I know not whether Milton's portrait should have been here noticed.In a note to the eloquent, the talented, and graceful "Discours
d'Installation, prononce par M. le Vicomte H. de Thury, president de la
Societe d'Horticulture de Paris," it is beautifully observed, that
"Personne n'a mieux decrit ce delicieux jardin que Milton.Les Anglais
regardent comme le type de tous les jardins paysagers, et pittoresques,
la description que fait Milton du jardin d'Eden, et qui atteste que se
sublime genie etoit egalement poete, peintre et paysagiste."As I have
sought for the portraits of Mr.Whateley, and
have noticed those of Launcelot Brown, and Mr.Cradock, M.
R. P. Knight and Sir U. Price, who were all _paysagists_; surely our
great and severe republican was one.The Prince de Ligne speaks thus of Milton:--"les vers enchanteurs de ce
Roi des poetes, et des _jardiniers_.I do not know that every one will agree with Switzer in the concluding
part of what he says of Milton, in the History of Gardening, prefixed to
his Iconologia:--"But although things were in this terrible combustion,
we must not omit the famous Mr.John Milton, one of Cromwell's
Secretaries; who, by his excellent and never-to-be-equalled poem of
Paradise Lost, has particularly distinguished gardening, by taking that
for his theme; and shows, that though his eyes deprived him of the
benefit of seeing, yet his mind was wonderfully moved with the
philosophy, innocence, and beauty of this employ; his books, though
mixed with other subjects, being a kind of a philosophical body of
gardening, as well as divinity._had his pen been employed on
no other subject_."It must be needless reminding my reader, that Mr.Walpole's powerful pen
has taken care that our mighty poet, (who "on evil days, though fallen,
and with darkness and solitude compassed round,") shall not be
_defrauded of half his glory_.It is gratifying to remark, that an edition of Paradise Lost is now
announced for publication, in which the zeal of its spirited proprietors
has determined, that every word shall be printed in letters of gold.The
sanction of some of our most distinguished divines, and men of high
rank, evince the pride with which we all acknowledge the devout zeal and
mighty powers of the blind poet.Garrick's fondness for ornamental gardening, induced him finely
to catch at this invention, in his inimitable performance of Lord
Chalkstone.Pulteney relates this anecdote of Mr.Miller: "He was the only
person I ever knew who remembered to have seen Mr.I shall not
easily forget the pleasure that enlightened his countenance, it so
strongly expressed the _Virgilium tantum vidi_, when, in speaking of
that revered man, he related to me that incident of his youth."Ray only meditated a work to have been entitled _Horti_ Angliae.Had he written it, I should have felt a singular pride in introducing
his valued name in the present imperfect volume.[85] The generous minded reader will be gratified by referring to the
kind tribute, paid to the memory of Shenstone, by Mr.Johnson, in his History
of Gardening, thus speaks:--"Taken as a whole, it is the most complete
book of gardening ever published;"--and that, with the exception of
chymistry, "every art and science, at all illustrative of gardening, are
made to contribute their assistance."[86] In his "Unconnected Thoughts" he admires the _Oak_, for "its
majestic appearance, the rough grandeur of its bark, and the wide
protection of its branches: a large, branching, aged oak, is, perhaps,
the most venerable of all inanimate objects."[87] Tea was the favourite beverage of Dr.When Hanway
pronounced his anathema against it, Johnson rose in defence of it,
declaring himself "in that article a hardened sinner, having for years
diluted my meals with the infusion of that fascinating plant; my
tea-kettle has had no time to cool; with tea I have solaced the midnight
hour, and with tea welcomed the morning."Pennant was a great lover
of tea; a hardy honest Welch parson, on hearing that he usually retired
in the afternoon to his summer-house to enjoy that beverage, was moved
with indignation, that any thing weaker than ale or wine should be drunk
there; and calling to mind the good hunting times of old, passionately
exclaimed, "his father would have scorned it."[88] Sir Uvedale thus expresses his own sensations when viewing some of
these plantations:--"The inside fully answers to the dreary appearance
of the outside; of all dismal scenes it seems to me the most likely for
a man to hang himself in; he would, however, find some difficulty in the
execution, for amidst the endless multitude of stems, there is rarely a
single side branch to which a rope could be fastened.The whole wood is
a collection of tall naked poles.... Even its gloom is without
solemnity; it is only dull and dismal; and what light there is, like
that of hell,

   _Serves only to discover scenes of woe,
   Regions of sorrow, doleful shades._"



[89] This observation confirms what Sir U. Price so pointedly enforces
throughout the whole of his causticly sportive letter to Mr.Repton:
"that the best landscape painters would be the best landscape gardeners,
were they to turn their minds to the practical part; consequently, a
study of their works, the most useful study to an improver."--And that
"Van Huysum would be a much better judge of the merits and defects of
the most dressed scene--of a mere flower garden,--than a gardener."Browne was not an author; yet the title of the present volume
is "On the Portraits of English _Authors_ on Gardening."Neither was old
Bridgman nor Kent _authors_ on this subject; still I could not prevail
on myself to pass over such names in total silence.Clive resided at Moreton-Say, near Market-Drayton.He was a
prebend of Westminster.In
his village, scarcely a poor man existed.His kindness and benevolence
to the poor, could only be equalled by his friendly hospitality and kind
feeling to the more affluent in his neighbourhood:

   _Thy works, and alms, and all thy good endeavour,
   Follow thee up to joy and bliss for ever._

Miss Seward thus concludes one of her letters to him:--"I wish none were
permitted to enter the lists of criticism but those who feel poetic
beauty as keenly as yourself, and who have the same generous desire that
others should feel it."Clive with gratitude, from a
recollection of kindnesses received from him at a very early period of
my life, and which were of such a nature, as could not fail to animate
the mind of a young man to studious exertions.Archdeacon Plimley (now
the truly venerable Archdeacon Corbet, and who has been so long an
honour to his native county), in his Agricultural Survey of Shropshire,
respectfully introduces Mr.Clive's name; and when he addressed his
charge to the diocese of Hereford, in 1793, one really cannot but apply
to Mr.Clive, what he so eloquently enforces in that charge to each
clergyman:--"to cultivate a pure spirit within their own bosoms; to be
in every instance the right-hand neighbour to each parishioner; their
private adviser, their public monitor, their example in christian
conduct, their joy in health, their consolation in sickness."Archdeacon Clive, lies buried Robert Lord Clive,
conqueror of _Plassy_: on whose death appeared these extempore lines, by
a man of distinction, a friend to Lord Clive:--

   Life's a surface, slippery, glassy,
   Whereon tumbled Clive of Plassy;
   All the wealth the east could give,
   Brib'd not death to let him live:
   There's no distinction in the grave
   'Twixt the nabob and the slave.His lordship's death, in 1774, was owing to the same cause which
hastened that of the most worthy of men, Sir Samuel Romilly--from
shattered and worn out nerves;--from severe study in the latter, and
from the burning climate of the east in the former.Had Lord Clive lived
a few years longer, he would have enriched the whole neighbourhood round
his native spot.His vigorous, ardently-gifted, and penetrating mind,
projected plantations and other improvements, that could only have been
conceived by such minds as Olivier de Serres, or by Sully, or by our own
Evelyn.He was generous, social and
friendly; and if ever charity to the poor warmed the breast of any
mortal, it warmed that of Lord Clive.Few men had more kind affections
than Lord Clive.[92] The following passage from a favourite book of Dr.Darwin's, (the
System of Nature, by Linnaeus) will well apply to that searching and
penetrating mind, which so strongly possessed him through life.--"How
small a part of the great works of nature is laid open to our eyes, and
how many things are going on in secret which we know nothing of!How
many things are there which this age first was acquainted with!How many
things that we are ignorant of will come to light when all memory of us
shall be no more!for nature does not at once reveal all her secrets.We
are apt to look on ourselves as already admitted into the sanctuary of
her temple; we are still only in the porch."How full of grace, of
tenderness, and passion, is that elegy, which he composed the night he
feared a life he so passionately loved (Mrs.Pole, of Radburn,) was in
imminent danger, and when he dreamed she was dead:

   Stretch'd on her sable bier, the grave beside,
     A snow-white shroud her breathless bosom bound,
   O'er her white brow the _mimic lace_ was tied,
     And loves, and virtues, hung their garlands round.From these cold lips did softest accents flow?Round that pale mouth did sweetest dimples play?On this dull cheek the rose of beauty blow,
     And those dim eyes diffuse celestial rays?Did this cold hand unasking want relieve,
     Or wake the lyre to every rapturous sound?How sad, for other's woes, this breast could heave!How light this heart, for other's transport, bound![93] It was at this period of his residence at Lichfield, that the
present writer heard him strongly enforce the cultivation of _papaver
somniferum_.What he may have also enforced to others, may possibly have
given rise to some of those ingenious papers on its cultivation, which
are inserted not only in the Transactions of the Society for the
Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce; in other publications,
but in the first and fifth volumes of the Memoirs of the Caledonian
Horticultural Society.Jones, on its
cultivation, in the former of these transactions, are particularly
diffuse and valuable.The subjoined plate is a copy of that in the title page to
"_Opiologia_, ou traicte concernant le naturel proprietes, vraye
preparation, et seur vsage de l'opium," a favourite volume with Dr.Darwin, printed at _la Haye_, 1614, 12mo.Darwin, in his Botanical
Garden, thus speaks of opium: "the finest opium is procured by wounding
the heads of large poppies with a three-edged knife, and tying
muscle-shells to them, to catch the drops.In small quantities it
exhilirates the mind, raises the passions, and invigorates the body; in
large ones, it is succeeded by intoxication, languor, stupor, and
death."[94] _Sterne_ mentions a traveller who always set out with the spleen
and jaundice,--"without one generous connection, or pleasurable anecdote
to tell of,--travelling straight on, looking neither to his right hand
or his left, lest love or pity should seduce him out of the road."Loudon seems to be a very different kind of a traveller: for his
horticultural spirit and benevolent views, pervade almost every page of
his late tour through _Bavaria_.One envies his feelings, too, in
another rural excursion, through the romantic scenery of _Bury_, at Mr.Hope's at _Deepdene_; and particularly when he
paints his own emotions on viewing the room of sculpture there.He even
could not, in October last, take his rural ride from _Edgware_ to _St.Alban's_ without thus awakening in each traveller a love of gardens, and
giving this gentle hint to an honest landlord:--"A new inn, in the
outskirts of _St.Alban's_, in the _Dunstable_ road, has an ample
garden, not made the most of.Such a piece of ground, and a gardener of
taste, would give an inn, so situated, so great a superiority, that
_every one would be tempted to stop there_; but the garden of this
Boniface, exhibits but the beginning of a good idea."When travelling
along our English roads, his mind no doubt frequently reverts to those
road-side gardens in the Netherlands, which he thus happily adverts to
in p.32 of his Encyclopaedia: "The gardens of the cottagers in these
countries, are undoubtedly better managed and more productive than those
of any other country; no man who has a cottage is without a garden
attached; often small, but rendered useful to a poor family, by the high
degree of culture given to it."Linnaeus, in his eloquent oration at
Upsal, enforces the pleasure of travelling in one's own country, through
its fields _and roads_.Heath, the zealous and affectionate
historian of Monmouth, in his account of that town and its romantic
neighbourhood, (published in 1804,) omits no opportunity of noticing the
many neat gardens, which add to the other rural charms of its rich
scenery, thus mentions another Boniface:--"The late Thomas Moxley, who
kept the public-house at Manson Cross, was a person that took great
delight in fruit-trees, and had a large piece of ground let him, for the
purpose of planting it with apple-trees; but his death (which followed
soon after) prevented the plan from being carried to the extent he
intended, though some of the land bears evidence of his zeal and
labour."Heath cannot even travel on the turnpike road, from
Monmouth to Hereford, without benevolently remarking, that "a number of
laborious families have erected small tenements, with a garden to each,
most of which are thickly planted with apple-trees, whose produce
considerably adds to the owner's support."[95] Of this celebrated biographer of Dr.Darwin (whose Verses to the
Memory of Mr.Garrick, and whose Monody on Captain Cook, will live as
long as our language is spoken,) Sir W. Scott thus describes his first
personal interview with:--"Miss Seward, when young, must have been
exquisitely beautiful; for, in advanced age, the regularity of her
features, the fire and expression of her countenance, gave her the
appearance of beauty, and almost of youth.Her eyes were auburn, of the
precise shade and hue of her hair, and possessed great expression.In
reciting, or in speaking with animation, they appeared to become darker;
and, as it were, to flash fire.I should have hesitated to state the
impression which this peculiarity made upon me at the time, had not my
observation been confirmed by that of the first actress of this or any
other age, with whom I lately happened to converse on our deceased
friend's expressive powers of countenance."[96] From one of these pleasing sermons I extract these few
lines:--"Among the most pleasing sights of a country village, is that of
a father and mother, followed by their family of different ages, issuing
from their little dwelling on a Sunday morning, as the bell tolls to
church.The children, with their ruddy, wholesome looks, are all neat
and clean.Their behaviour at church shews what an impression their
parents have given them of the holiness of the place, and of the duties
they have to perform.Though unregarded, as they return home, by their
richer neighbours, they carry back with them to their humble cottage the
blessing of God.--Pious parents!lead on your children from church to
heaven.an account of
some of the most remarkable places in North Wales.de Voltaire was so charmed with the taste and talents, and
polite engaging manners of La Fage, that he paid him the following
compliment; which may very justly be applied to Mr.Cradock:

   _Il recut deux presens des Dieux,
   Les plus charmans qu'ils puissent faire;
   L'un etoit le talent de plaire,
   L'autre le secret d'etre heureux._



[99] The Quarterly Review for April, 1821, observes, that "The total
number of exotics, introduced into this country, appears to be 11,970,
of which the first forty-seven species, including the orange, apricot,
pomegranate, &c. were introduced previously or during the reign of Henry
VIII., and no fewer than 6756 in the reign of George III.For this proud
accession to our exotic botany in the last century, the public are
chiefly indebted to Sir Joseph Banks, and Messrs.Lee and Kennedy, of
the Hammersmith nursery."[100] The invocation to this Vale, reminds one of Mr.Repton's
description:--"Downton Vale, near Ludlow, one of the most beautiful and
romantic valleys that the imagination can conceive.It is impossible by
description to convey an idea of its natural charms, or to do justice to
that taste which has displayed these charms to the greatest advantage,

   _With art clandestine, and conceal'd design._

A narrow, wild, and natural path, sometimes creeps under the beetling
rock, close by the margin of a mountain stream.It sometimes ascends to
an awful precipice, from whence the foaming waters are heard roaring in
the dark abyss below, or seen wildly dashing against its opposite banks;
while, in other places, the course of the river _Teme_ being impeded by
natural ledges of rock, the vale presents a calm, glassy mirror, that
reflects the surrounding foliage.The path, in various places, crosses
the water by bridges of the most romantic and contrasted forms; and,
branching in various directions, including some miles in length, is
occasionally varied and enriched by caves and cells, hovels, and covered
seats, or other buildings, in perfect harmony with the wild but pleasing
horrors of the scene."[101] Foxley, this far-famed seat of dignified and benevolent
retirement, has on many occasions become interesting.It gave a peaceful asylum to Benjamin Stillingfleet, when
his mind was depressed by disappointment.The then owner, Robert Price,
Esq.and his mild and amiable lady, both kindly pressed him to become an
inmate of their domestic retreat, that his health might be restored, and
his mind calmed; and though he modestly refused being a constant
intruder, yet he took up his residence in a cottage near them, and
delighted to pass his leisure hours in their happy domestic circle,
"blending his studious pursuits, with rural occupations," and
particularly with gardening.No doubt, to this protecting kindness, may,
on this spot, have been imbibed his great veneration for Theophrastus;
and here he must have laid the foundation of those attainments, which,
during the future periods of his life, obtained for him the high
approbation of the justly celebrated Mrs.Montagu, who, in her letters,
speaks of "this invaluable friend," in the highest possible terms of
praise.In this peaceful and consoling retreat, was written his original
and masterly tribute to the talents of Xenophon; and here was first
kindled his deep enthusiastic zeal for the classic authors of antiquity;
and the materials for his then intended edition of Milton (who he says
equalled all the ancients whom he imitated; the sublimity of Homer, the
majesty of Sophocles, the softness of Theocritus, and the gaiety of
Anacreon,) enriched with parallel passages from holy writ, the classics,
and the early Italian poets; and here he composed his matchless treatise
on the power and principles of Tartini's music (for it seems Mr.Price
himself "was a master of the art.")Here too, most probably, he
sketched, or first gathered, his early memoranda towards his future
general history of husbandry, from the earliest ages of the world to his
own time; and fostered a devoted zeal for Linnaeus, which produced that
spirited eulogium on him, which pervades the preface to his translation
of "Miscellaneous Tracts on Natural History."[102] Sir Uvedale, about fifty years ago, translated _Pausanias_ from
the Greek.One may judge of the feeling with which he dwelt on the pages
of this book, by what he says of that nation in vol.65 of his
Essays, where he speaks of being struck with the extreme richness of
some of the windows of our cathedrals and ruined abbeys: "I hope it will
not be supposed, that by admiring the picturesque circumstances of the
Gothic, I mean to undervalue the symmetry and beauty of Grecian
buildings: whatever comes to us from the Greeks, has an irresistible
claim to our admiration; that distinguished people seized on the true
points both of beauty and grandeur in all the arts, and their
architecture has justly obtained the same high pre-eminence as their
sculpture, poetry, and eloquence."[103] On the pomp of devotion in our ancient abbeys, Mr.R. P. Knight
thus interests his readers, in the chapter "Of the Sublime and
Pathetic," in the Inquiry into the principles of Taste:--"Every person
who has attended the celebration of high mass, at any considerable
ecclesiastical establishment, must have felt how much the splendour and
magnificence of the Roman Catholic worship tends to exalt the spirit of
devotion, and to inspire the soul with rapture and enthusiasm.Not only
the impressive melody of the vocal and instrumental music, and the
imposing solemnity of the ceremonies, but the pomp and brilliancy of the
sacerdotal garments, and the rich and costly decorations of the altar,
raise the character of religion, and give it an air of dignity and
majesty unknown to any of the reformed churches."he thus adverts to the effects of
the levelling system of Launcelot Browne:--"From this influence of
fashion, and the particular influence of Mr.Browne, models of old
gardens are in this country still scarcer in nature than in painting;
and therefore what good parts there may be in such gardens, whether
proceeding from original design, or from the changes produced by time
and accident, can no longer be observed; and yet, from these specimens
of ancient art, however they may be condemned as old fashioned, many
hints might certainly be taken, and blended with such modern
improvements as really deserve the name."--"Were my arguments in favour
of many parts of the old style of gardening ever so convincing, the most
I could hope from them at present, would be, to produce _some caution_;
and to assist in preserving some of the few remains of old magnificence
that still exist, by making the owner less ready to listen to a
professor, whose interest it is to recommend total demolition."R.
P. Knight, in a note to his _landscape_, thus remarks on this subject:
"I remember a country clock-maker, who being employed to clean a more
complex machine than he had been accustomed to, very confidently took it
to pieces; but finding, when he came to put it together again, some
wheels of which he could not discover the use, very discreetly carried
them off in his pocket.The simple artifice of this prudent mechanic,
always recurs to my mind, when I observe the manner in which our modern
improvers repair and embellish old places; not knowing how to employ the
terraces, mounds, avenues, and other features which they find there,
they take them all away, and cover the places which they occupied with
turf.It is a short and easy method of proceeding; and if their
employers will be satisfied with it, they are not to be blamed for
persevering in it, as it may be executed by proxy, as well as in
person."Severely (and no doubt justly), as the too generally smooth and
monotonous system of Mr.Browne has been condemned, yet he must have had
great merit to have obtained the many encomiums he did obtain from some
of our first nobility and gentry.The _evil_ which he did in many of
their altered pleasure-grounds, _lives after him--the good is oft
interred in his grave_.George Mason justly observes that "Nature's favourite haunts
are the school of gardening."Chrysostom said of Xenophon, that "he had something of
witchcraft in his writings."It would not be too much to say the same of
this poet.Ginger was gone about two hours, and when 'e came back he looked so
solemn that old Sam asked 'im whether he 'ad seen a ghost.Ginger didn't
answer 'im; he set down on the side o' the bed and sat thinking."I s'pose--I s'pose it's nice and fresh in the streets this morning?"ses Bill, at last, in a trembling voice."I didn't notice, mate," he ses.Then
'e got up and patted Bill on the back, very gentle, and sat down again.[Illustration: "Patted Bill on the back, very gentle."]asks Peter Russet, staring at 'im."It's that landlord," ses Ginger; "there's straw down in the road
outside, and they say that he's dying.Pore old Bill don't know 'is own
strength.The best thing you can do, old pal, is to go as far away as
you can, at once.""I shouldn't wait a minnit if it was me," ses old Sam.Bill groaned and hid 'is face in his 'ands, and then Peter Russet went
and spoilt things by saying that the safest place for a murderer to 'ide
in was London.Bill gave a dreadful groan when 'e said murderer, but 'e
up and agreed with Peter, and all Sam and Ginger Dick could do wouldn't
make 'im alter his mind.He said that he would shave off 'is beard and
moustache, and when night came 'e would creep out and take a lodging
somewhere right the other end of London."It'll soon be dark," ses Ginger, "and your own brother wouldn't know you
now, Bill."Nobody must know that, mate," he ses."I must go
into hiding for as long as I can--as long as my money lasts; I've only
got six pounds left.""That'll last a long time if you're careful," ses Ginger."I want a lot more," ses Bill."I want you to take this silver ring as a
keepsake, Ginger.If I 'ad another six pounds or so I should feel much
safer.'Ow much 'ave you got, Ginger?""Not much," ses Ginger, shaking his 'ead."Lend it to me, mate," ses Bill, stretching out his 'and.Ah, I wish I was you; I'd be as 'appy as 'appy if I
hadn't got a penny.""I'm very sorry, Bill," ses Ginger, trying to smile, "but I've already
promised to lend it to a man wot we met this evening.A promise is a
promise, else I'd lend it to you with pleasure.""Would you let me be 'ung for the sake of a few pounds, Ginger?"ses
Bill, looking at 'im reproach-fully."I'm a desprit man, Ginger, and I
must 'ave that money."Afore pore Ginger could move he suddenly clapped 'is hand over 'is mouth
and flung 'im on the bed.Ginger was like a child in 'is hands, although
he struggled like a madman, and in five minutes 'e was laying there with
a towel tied round his mouth and 'is arms and legs tied up with the cord
off of Sam's chest."I'm very sorry, Ginger," ses Bill, as 'e took a little over eight pounds
out of Ginger's pocket."I'll pay you back one o' these days, if I can.If you'd got a rope round your neck same as I 'ave you'd do the same as
I've done."He lifted up the bedclothes and put Ginger inside and tucked 'im up.Ginger's face was red with passion and 'is eyes starting out of his 'ead."Eight and six is fifteen," ses Bill, and just then he 'eard somebody
coming up the stairs.Ginger 'eard it, too, and as Peter Russet came
into the room 'e tried all 'e could to attract 'is attention by rolling
'is 'ead from side to side."Why, 'as Ginger gone to bed?""He's all right," ses Bill; "just a bit of a 'eadache."Peter stood staring at the bed, and then 'e pulled the clothes off and
saw pore Ginger all tied up, and making awful eyes at 'im to undo him."I 'ad to do it, Peter," ses Bill."I wanted some more money to escape
with, and 'e wouldn't lend it to me.I 'aven't got as much as I want
now.You just came in in the nick of time.Another minute and you'd ha'
missed me."Ah, I wish I could lend you some, Bill," ses Peter Russet, turning pale,
"but I've 'ad my pocket picked; that's wot I came back for, to get some
from Ginger.""You see 'ow it is, Bill," ses Peter, edging back toward the door; "three
men laid 'old of me and took every farthing I'd got.""Well, I can't rob you, then," ses Bill, catching 'old of 'im."Whoever's money this is," he ses, pulling a handful out o' Peter's
pocket, "it can't be yours.Now, if you make another sound I'll knock
your 'ead off afore I tie you up.""Don't tie me up, Bill," ses Peter, struggling."I can't trust you," ses Bill, dragging 'im over to the washstand and
taking up the other towel; "turn round."Peter was a much easier job than Ginger Dick, and arter Bill 'ad done 'im
'e put 'im in alongside o' Ginger and covered 'em up, arter first tying
both the gags round with some string to prevent 'em slipping."Mind, I've only borrowed it," he ses, standing by the side o' the bed;
"but I must say, mates, I'm disappointed in both of you.If either of
you 'ad 'ad the misfortune wot I've 'ad, I'd have sold the clothes off my
back to 'elp you.And I wouldn't 'ave waited to be asked neither."He stood there for a minute very sorrowful, and then 'e patted both their
'eads and went downstairs.Ginger and Peter lay listening for a bit, and
then they turned their pore bound-up faces to each other and tried to
talk with their eyes.Then Ginger began to wriggle and try and twist the cords off, but 'e
might as well 'ave tried to wriggle out of 'is skin.The worst of it was
they couldn't make known their intentions to each other, and when Peter
Russet leaned over 'im and tried to work 'is gag off by rubbing it up
agin 'is nose, Ginger pretty near went crazy with temper.He banged
Peter with his 'ead, and Peter banged back, and they kept it up till
they'd both got splitting 'eadaches, and at last they gave up in despair
and lay in the darkness waiting for Sam.And all this time Sam was sitting in the Red Lion, waiting for them.He
sat there quite patient till twelve o'clock and then walked slowly 'ome,
wondering wot 'ad happened and whether Bill had gone.Ginger was the fust to 'ear 'is foot on the stairs, and as he came into
the room, in the darkness, him an' Peter Russet started shaking their bed
in a way that scared old Sam nearly to death.He thought it was Bill
carrying on agin, and 'e was out o' that door and 'arf-way downstairs
afore he stopped to take breath.He stood there trembling for about ten
minutes, and then, as nothing 'appened, he walked slowly upstairs agin on
tiptoe, and as soon as they heard the door creak Peter and Ginger made
that bed do everything but speak.ses old Sam, in a shaky voice, and standing ready
to dash downstairs agin.There was no answer except for the bed, and Sam didn't know whether Bill
was dying or whether 'e 'ad got delirium trimmings.All 'e did know was
that 'e wasn't going to sleep in that room.He shut the door gently and
went downstairs agin, feeling in 'is pocket for a match, and, not finding
one, 'e picked out the softest stair 'e could find and, leaning his 'ead
agin the banisters, went to sleep.[Illustration: "Picked out the softest stair 'e could find."]It was about six o'clock when 'e woke up, and broad daylight.He was
stiff and sore all over, and feeling braver in the light 'e stepped
softly upstairs and opened the door.Peter and Ginger was waiting for
'im, and as he peeped in 'e saw two things sitting up in bed with their
'air standing up all over like mops and their faces tied up with
bandages.He was that startled 'e nearly screamed, and then 'e stepped
into the room and stared at 'em as if he couldn't believe 'is eyes."Wot d'ye mean by making sights of
yourselves like that?'Ave you took leave of your senses?"Ginger and Peter shook their 'eads and rolled their eyes, and then Sam
see wot was the matter with 'em.Fust thing 'e did was to pull out 'is
knife and cut Ginger's gag off, and the fust thing Ginger did was to call
'im every name 'e could lay his tongue to."You wait a moment," he screams, 'arf crying with rage."You wait till I
get my 'ands loose and I'll pull you to pieces.The idea o' leaving us
like this all night, you old crocodile.He cut off Peter Russet's gag, and Peter Russet
called 'im 'arf a score o' names without taking breath."And when Ginger's finished I'll 'ave a go at you," he ses."Oh, you wait till I get my 'ands on
you."Sam didn't answer 'em; he shut up 'is knife with a click and then 'e sat
at the foot o' the bed on Ginger's feet and looked at 'em.It wasn't the
fust time they'd been rude to 'im, but as a rule he'd 'ad to put up with
it.He sat and listened while Ginger swore 'imself faint."That'll do," he ses, at last; "another word and I shall put the
bedclothes over your 'ead.Afore I do anything more I want to know wot
it's all about."Peter told 'im, arter fust calling 'im some more names, because Ginger
was past it, and when 'e'd finished old Sam said 'ow surprised he was
at them for letting Bill do it, and told 'em how they ought to 'ave
prevented it.He sat there talking as though 'e enjoyed the sound of 'is
own voice, and he told Peter and Ginger all their faults and said wot
sorrow it caused their friends.Twice he 'ad to throw the bedclothes
over their 'eads because o' the noise they was making.[Illustration: "Old Sam said 'ow surprised he was at them for letting
Bill do it."]"_Are you going--to undo--us?_"  ses Ginger, at last."No, Ginger," ses old Sam; "in justice to myself I couldn't do it.Arter
wot you've said--and arter wot I've said--my life wouldn't be safe.Besides which, you'd want to go shares in my money."He took up 'is chest and marched downstairs with it, and about 'arf an
hour arterward the landlady's 'usband came up and set 'em free.As soon
as they'd got the use of their legs back they started out to look for
Sam, but they didn't find 'im for nearly a year, and as for Bill, they
never set eyes on 'im again.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Bill's Lapse, by W.W."Prentiss and Wallace have
surrendered.""Oh, for Lew Wallace, for Nelson, or
for night," he groaned.From across the river there came to his ears the sound of cheering.Grant looked, and there among the trees he saw the banners of Nelson's
regiments waving.Hope came into his eyes; his face lighted up.he cried to his aids, "go to Sherman, to McClernand, to
Hurlbut.But if Grant had known it the danger had already passed; for Beauregard
had given orders for his army to cease fighting.Night was coming on,
the capture of W. H. L. Wallace's and Prentiss' divisions had
disarranged his lines, and thinking that he was sure of his prey in the
morning, he had given orders to withdraw.One brigade of the Confederate army did not receive this order, and when
Nelson's advance crossed the river this brigade was charging the line of
cannon on the left.These cannon were entirely unprotected by infantry,
and Grant himself placed Nelson's men in line as they arrived.The Confederate brigade was advancing with triumphant shouts, when they
were met with a withering volley and sent reeling back.Then, to his
surprise, the commander found that of all of the Confederate army his
brigade was the only one continuing the fight, and he hastily fell back.Alone and practically unaided the brave soldiers of the Army of the
Tennessee had fought the battle of Sunday and saved themselves from
capture.The battle of Monday was mainly the fight of the Army of the Ohio.Without its aid Grant could never have been able to turn defeat into
victory, and send the Confederate hosts in headlong flight back to
Corinth.There would have been no advance Monday morning if Buell had
not been on the field.The whole energy of Grant would have been devoted
to the saving of what remained of his army.The terrible conflict of the day had left its impress on the Army of the
Tennessee.There was but a remnant in line capable of battle when night
came.The generals of divisions were so disheartened that the coming of Buell
failed to restore their spirits.Even the lion-hearted Sherman wavered
and was downcast.Grant found him sitting in the darkness beside a tree,
his head buried in his hands, and his heart full of fears.Three horses had been shot under him, and he
had received two wounds.When Grant told him there was to be an advance
in the morning, he sadly shook his head and said: "No use, General, no
use; the fight is all out of the men.I do not possibly see how we can
assume the offensive."If we assume the offensive in the morning a glorious victory awaits us.Lew Wallace is here; Buell will have at least 20,000 fresh troops on the
field.The Confederates, like ourselves, are exhausted and demoralized.If we become the aggressors, success is sure."Sherman became convinced; his fears were gone, his hopes revived.Why was it that the fiery and impetuous Nelson was so late in getting on
the field?He was only nine miles away early in the morning, and had
received orders from Grant to move his division opposite Pittsburg
Landing.If there had been any roads there would have been no excuse for
his delay.But a heavily timbered, swampy bottom lay between him and his
destination.The river had been very high, overflowing the whole bottom,
and when the water had receded it left a waste of mud, from which all
vestige of a road had disappeared.To plunge into that waste of mud and
wilderness without a guide would have been madness.A guide, though
Grant said one could easily be found, could not be secured.So Nelson
sent a staff officer to see if he could find a practicable route.This
officer did not return until noon.All of this time the division lay
listening to the booming of cannon and eager to be led to the fray.As
for Nelson, he fretted and fumed, stormed and swore at the delay."The expected has come," he growled, "and here I am doing no more good
than if I were a hundred miles away.Might have been on the field, too,
if Grant had not kept saying, 'No use hurrying!'I knew they were a set
of fools to think that Johnston would sit down at Corinth and suck his
thumbs."At length a guide was found who said he could pilot the division
through the bottom, but that the route was passable only for horsemen
and infantry; the artillery would have to be left behind.The division
started at one o'clock, the men keeping step to the music of the thunder
of cannon."This beats Donelson," remarked Fred, as the roar of artillery never
ceased."My boy," replied Nelson, "the greatest battle ever fought on this
continent is now being waged.God grant that we may get there in time.It was rumored at Savannah that the Confederates were sweeping
everything before them.""Your division will surely give a good account of itself," said Fred,
looking back, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm."See how eager the men
are, and how well they keep closed up, notwithstanding the mud.Half of
them are mourning because they think the battle will be over before they
get there.""The question is, shall we be in
time."Soon the roll of musketry began to be heard; then the cheers of the
combatants.A quiver of excitement ran along the lines, and every
soldier grasped his musket with a firmer hold.As they approached the
river cannon balls began to crash through the treetops above them; then
was heard the peculiar whir of the minie ball when it is nearly
spent--so close was the fighting to the river.To Fred's surprise, he saw numerous skulkers dodging through the timber
on the same side of the river as himself.In some manner they had
managed to get across the river; not only this, but the boats which came
to ferry Nelson's troops over were more or less crowded with these
skulkers, who would have died rather than be driven off.In the river
were seen men on logs making their way across, and some of these men
wore shoulder straps.So incensed were Nelson's soldiers at the sight of such cowardice that
they begged for permission to shoot them.As they landed, Fred stood aghast at the sight before him.Cowering
beneath the high bank were thousands upon thousands of trembling
wretches.It was a dense mass of shivering, weeping, wailing, swearing,
praying humanity, each one lost to shame, lost to honor, lost to
everything but that dreadful fear which chained him soul and body.As Nelson's advance brigade forced its way through the panic-stricken
throng, they were greeted with, "You are all going to your death!"Don't touch my men; you
contaminate them; don't speak to them, you cowards, miscreants, you
should be swept from the face of the earth."And in the fury of his wrath, Nelson begged for the privilege of turning
cannon on them.With firm, unwavering steps, and well closed up, the division pressed
their way up the bank, and there were soldiers in the ranks who looked
with contempt on the shivering wretches below the hill, who themselves,
the next day, fled in terror from the awful destruction going on around
them.So little do we know ourselves and what we will do when the
supreme moment comes.Afterward the great majority of the soldiers who cowered under the bank
at Shiloh covered themselves with glory, and hundreds of them laid down
their lives for their country.From the Landing
came the groans and shrieks of the wounded, tortured under the knives of
the surgeons.The night was as dark and cloudy as the day had been
bright and clear.About eleven o'clock a torrent of rain fell, drenching
the living, and cooling the fevered brows of the wounded.Fred sat
against a tree, holding the bridle of his horse in his hand.If by
chance he fell asleep, he would be awakened by the great cannon of the
gunboats, which threw shells far inland every fifteen minutes.At the first dawn of day Nelson's division advanced, and the battle
began.Fred acted as aid to Nelson, and as the general watched him as he
rode amid the storm of bullets unmoved he would say to those around him:
"Just see that boy; there is the making of a hero."About eleven o'clock one of Nelson's brigades made a most gallant
charge.Wheeling to the right, the brigade swept the Confederate line
for more than half a mile.Before them the enemy fled, a panic-stricken
mob.A battery was run over as though the guns were blocks of wood,
instead of iron-throated monsters vomiting forth fire and death.In the
thickest of the fight, Fred noticed Robert Marsden, the betrothed of
Mabel Vaughn, cheering on his men.thought Fred, "he is worthy of Mabel.May his life be spared to
make her happy."On, on swept the brigade; a second battery was reached, and over one of
the guns he saw Marsden fighting like a tiger.Then the smoke of battle
hid him from view.On the left Fred saw a mere boy spring from out an Indiana regiment,
shoot down a Confederate color-bearer, snatch the colors from his dying
grasp, wave them defiantly in the face of the enemy, and then coolly
walk back to his place in the ranks.General Nelson saw the act, and turning to Fred, said: "I want you to
hunt that boy up, and bring him to me after the battle."But the brigade paid dearly for its daring charge.A strong line, lying
down, let the frightened fugitives pass over them; then they arose and
poured a deadly volley into the very faces of the charging column.Cannon in front and on the flank tore great gaps through the line.The
brigade halted, wavered, and then fled wildly back, leaving a third of
its number dead and wounded.By three o'clock the battle was over; the Confederates were in full
retreat, and the bloody field of Shiloh won.As the firing died away, Fred sat on his horse and shudderingly surveyed
the field.The muddy ground was trampled as by the feet of giants.The
forest was shattered as by ten thousand thunderbolts, while whole
thickets had been leveled, as though a huge jagged scythe had swept over
them.By tree and log, in every thicket, on every hillside, dotting every
field, lay the dead and wounded.Many of the dead were crushed out of
all semblance of humanity, trampled beneath the hoof of the warhorse or
ground beneath the ponderous wheels of the artillery.Over 20,000 men
lay dead and wounded, Confederate and Federal commingled.The fondest hopes of the Confederates had
been blasted; instead of marching triumphantly forward to Nashville, as
they hoped, they retreated sullenly back to Corinth.But the battle brought the war to the hearts of the people as it had
never been brought before.From the stricken homes of the North and the
South there arose a great wail of agony--a weeping for those who would
not return.On Monday morning, just as the first scattering shots of Nelson's
skirmishers were heard, Calhoun Pennington presented himself before the
Hon.G. M. Johnson, Provisional Governor of Kentucky, on whose staff he
was.When the Confederates retreated from Bowling Green Governor Johnson
accompanied the Kentucky brigade south, and although not a soldier he
had bravely fought throughout the entire battle of the day before.The Governor and General Beauregard were engaged in earnest conversation
when Calhoun came up, and both uttered an exclamation of surprise at his
forlorn appearance.He was pale and haggard, his eyes were sunken and
his garments were dripping with water, for he had just swum the
Tennessee river.cried Johnson, and he caught
Calhoun's hand and wrung it until he winced with pain."It is what is left of me," answered Calhoun, with a faint smile."You don't know," continued Johnson, "how glad I am to see you.I had
given you up for lost, and bitterly blamed myself for allowing you to
go on your dangerous undertaking."First," answered Calhoun, "I must speak to General Beauregard," and,
saluting, he said: "General, I bring you heavy news."I feared it, I feared it, when the
Federals opened the battle this morning.I was just telling the Governor
as you came up that Grant would never have assumed the offensive if he
had not been reinforced."said Calhoun, "if I had only been a couple of days earlier; if you
had only attacked a couple of days sooner!""That was the calculation," answered Beauregard, "but the dreadful roads
retarded us.Then we did not expect Buell for two or three days yet.Our
scouts brought us information that he was to halt at least a couple of
days at Waynesborough.""So he was," answered Calhoun, bitterly; "and he would have done so if
it had not been for that renegade Kentuckian, General Nelson.He it was
who rushed through, and made it possible for Buell to be on the field
to-day.""Do you know how many men Buell has?""Three strong divisions; I should say full 20,000.""I thank you,
Lieutenant, for your information, although it is the knell of defeat.Yesterday we fought for victory; to-day I shall have to fight to save my
army."So saying he mounted his horse and galloped rapidly to the scene
of action."This is bad news that you bring, Lieutenant," said the Governor, after
Beauregard had gone."But tell me about yourself; you must have been in
trouble."At first I was very successful, and
found out that Nelson expected to be in Savannah by April 5th.I was
just starting back with this important information, information which
meant victory for our cause, when I was suddenly set upon and captured
before I had time to raise a hand.I was accused of being a spy, but
there was no proof against me, the only person who could have convicted
me being a cousin, who refused to betray me; but he managed to hold me
until my knowledge could do no good.""It looks as though the hand of God were against us," solemnly responded
Johnson."If you had not been captured, we would surely have attacked a
day or two earlier, and a glorious victory would have awaited us.But
now----" the Governor paused, choked back something like a sob, and then
continued: "There is no use of vain regrets.See, the battle is on, and
I must once more take my place in the ranks and do my duty.""Must fight in the ranks as a private soldier, as I did yesterday,"
replied the Governor calmly."I shall go with you," replied Calhoun.So side by side the Governor and his aid fought as private soldiers, and
did yeoman service.Just before the battle closed, in repelling the last
furious charge of the Federals, Governor Johnson gave a sharp cry,
staggered, and would have fallen if he had not been caught in the arms
of Calhoun.Loving hands carried him back, but the brave spirit had fled
forever.Thus died the most distinguished private soldier that fell on
the field of Shiloh.One of the first acts of Fred after the battle was over was to ride in
search of Robert Marsden.He found him lying in a heap of slain at the
place where the battery had been charged.A bullet had pierced the
center of the miniature flag, and it was wet with his heart's blood.Reverently Fred removed the flag, closed the sightless eyes, and gave
orders that the body, as soon as possible, be sent to Louisville.As he was returning from this sad duty, he thought of the errand given
him by General Nelson to hunt up the boy whom they saw capture the
colors.Riding up to the regiment, he made inquiry, and to his surprise
and delight found that the hero was Hugh Raymond.asked Fred, when the boy presented
himself."Yes, sir," replied Hugh, respectfully."You are the young officer who
got me released when General Nelson tied me to the cannon.I have never
ceased to feel grateful towards you.""Well, Hugh, General Nelson wants to see you again.""Don't want to tie me up again, does
he?"He saw you capture that flag and he is awful mad; so come
along.""General," said Fred, when he had found Nelson, "here is the brave boy
who captured the colors.""That was a gallant act, my boy," kindly remarked Nelson, "and you
deserve the thanks of your general.""It was nothing, General," replied Hugh."It just made me mad to have
them shake their dirty rag in my face, and I resolved to have it."He noticed Hugh more closely, and
then suddenly asked: "Have I not seen you somewhere before, my boy?""Yes, General," replied Hugh, trembling."On the march here, when you tied me by the wrists to a cannon for
straggling."Nelson was slightly taken back by the answer; then an amused look came
into his face, and he said, in a bantering tone: "Liked it, didn't you?""I was just
mad enough at you to kill you.""There is the boy for me," said Nelson, turning to his staff."He not
only captures flags, but he tells his general to his face what he thinks
of him."Then addressing Hugh, he continued: "I want a good orderly, and
I will detail you for the position."So Hugh Raymond became an orderly to General Nelson, and learned to love
him as much as he once hated him.Now occurred one of those strange psychological impressions which
science has never yet explained.A feeling came to Fred that he must
ride over the battlefield.It was as if some unseen hand was pulling
him, some power exerted that he could not resist.He mounted his horse
and rode away, the course he took leading him to the place where
Trabue's Kentucky brigade made its last desperate stand.Suddenly the prostrate figure of a Confederate officer, apparently dead,
attracted Fred's attention.As he looked a great fear clutched at his
heart, causing it to stand still.Springing from his horse, he bent over
the death-like form; then with a cry of anguish sank on his knees beside
it.He had looked into the face of his father.[Illustration: Springing from his Horse, he bent over the death-like
form.]Bending down, he placed his ear over his father's heart; a faint
fluttering could be heard.A ball had shattered Colonel
Shackelford's leg, and he was bleeding to death.For Fred to cut away the clothing from around the wound, and then to
take a handkerchief and tightly twist it around the limb above the wound
was the work of a moment.Tenderly was
Colonel Shackelford carried back, his weeping son walking by his side.The surgeon carefully examined the wounded limb, and then brusquely
said: "It will have to come off.""It's that, or his life," shortly answered the surgeon."Do it then," hoarsely replied Fred, as he turned away unable to bear
the cruel sight.When Colonel Shackelford came to himself, he was lying in a state-room
in a steamboat, and was rapidly gliding down the Tennessee.Fred was
sitting by his side, watching every movement, for his father had been
hovering between life and death.Colonel Shackelford faintly asked."Dear father," whispered Fred, "you have been very sick.Don't talk,"
and he gave him a soothing potion.The colonel took it without a word, and sank into a quiet slumber.The
surgeon came in, and looking at him, said: "It is all right, captain; he
has passed the worst, and careful nursing will bring him around."When the surgeon was gone Fred fell on his knees and poured out his soul
in gratitude that his father was to live.When Colonel Shackelford became strong enough to hear the story, Fred
told him all; how he found him on the battlefield nearly dead from the
loss of blood; how he bound up his wound and saved his life."And now, father," he said, "I am taking you home--home where we can be
happy once more."The wounded man closed his eyes and did not speak.Fred sank on his
knees beside him."Father," he moaned, "father, can you not forgive?Can you not take me
to your heart and love me once more?"The father trembled; then stretching forth his feeble arm, he gently
placed his hand on the head of his boy and murmured, "My son!In the old Kentucky home
Fred nursed his father back to health and strength.But another sad duty remained for Fred to perform.As soon as he felt
that he could safely leave his father, he went to Louisville and placed
in Mabel Vaughn's hands the little flag, torn by the cruel bullet and
crimsoned with the heart's blood of her lover.The color fled from her
face, she tottered, and Fred thought she was going to faint, but she
recovered herself quickly, and leading him to a seat said gently: "Now
tell me all about it."Fred told her of the dreadful charge; how Marsden, in the very front,
among the bravest of the brave, had found a soldier's death; and when he
had finished the girl raised her streaming eyes to heaven and thanked
God that he had given her such a lover.Then standing before Fred, her beautiful face rendered still more
beautiful by her sorrow, she said:

"Robert is gone, but I still have a work to do.Hereafter I shall do
what I can to alleviate the sufferings of those who uphold the country's
flag.In memory of this," and she pressed the little blood-stained flag
to her lips, "I devote my life to this sacred object."And binding up her broken heart, she went forth on her mission of love.She cooled the fevered brow, she bound up the broken limb, she whispered
words of consolation into the ear of the dying, and wiped the death damp
from the marble brow.Her very presence was a benediction, and those
whose minds wandered would whisper as she passed that they had seen an
angel.Calhoun Pennington bitterly mourned the death of his chief.He afterward
joined his fortune with John H. Morgan, and became one of that famous
raider's most daring and trusted officers.For some weeks Fred remained at home, happy in the company and love of
his father.But their peace was rudely disturbed by the raids of Morgan,
and then by the invasion of Kentucky by the Confederate armies.After the untimely death of Nelson, Fred became attached to the staff of
General George H. Thomas, and greatly distinguished himself in the
numerous campaigns participated in by that famous general.But he never
performed more valiant service than when he was known as "General
Nelson's Scout."The Villa Garden Directory; or, Monthly Index of Work to be done in

RICHARD RICHARDSON.Of either of the above enumerated Authors on Gardening, I have not been
able to discover any Portrait.[Illustration]

   Of the following we _have_ Portraits:--

LEONARD MASCALL'S portrait appears at the bottom of the curious title
page to his "Government of Cattle," 4to.He published,
in 1572, "The New Art of Planting and Grafting;" 4to.WILLIAM BULLEYN practised physic at Durham.He had
the misfortune to lose great part of his library by shipwreck.He was
thrown into prison for debt, where he wrote a great part of his medical
treatises.Bishop Tanner says he was a man of acute judgment, and true
piety.He was universally esteemed as a polished scholar, and as a man
of probity, benevolence, and piety.Pulteney:--"Of Dr.Bulleyn there is a profile with a long beard, before
his "Government of Health," and a whole length of him, in wood, prefixed
to the "Bulwarke of Defence;" which book is a collection of most of his
works.Stukely, who, in 1722, was at
the expence of having a small head of him engraved.He proves that we
had excellent apples, pears, plums, cherries and hops, of our own
growth, (before the importation of these articles into England), by
London and Kentish gardeners.His zeal for the promotion of the useful
arts of gardening, the general culture of the land, and the commercial
interests of the kingdom, deserved the highest praise; and for the
information he has left of these affairs, in his own time, posterity owe
him acknowledgments."In a note to his Life, in the Biog.folio, 1748, is a curious account of many fruits, &c. then in our
gardens.Richardson's portraits to Granger
gives us the above profile.Johnson, at page 51 of his History of
English Gardening, pointedly says, "Dr.Bulleyn deserves the veneration
of every lover of gardening, for his strenuous advocating its cause, at
a time when it had become a fashion to depreciate the products of our
English gardens."And at page 57, pays him a further just tribute.THOMAS HYLL, who, in 1574, published, in 4to., "The Profitable Arte of
Gardeninge."His interesting chapter on
Bees is annexed to these editions."[61] There appears another edition in
small 12mo.imprinted at London, in Flete-strete, neare to St.Dunstone's Church, by Thomas Marshe, 1658.There are other editions, as
1570 and 1574, 4to.; and 1563 and 1594, 16mo.Bromley thus
mentions a portrait of him:--"Thomas Hill, wooden cut, prefixed to his
Physiognomie; 12mo.A friend to Hyll, in a complimentary
letter, prefixed to the above book, thus, in part, addresses the
reader:--

   _With painfull pen the writer hath exprest in English plane,
   The needfull ayd, and mightie force, that doth in hearbes remaine,
   The time to set, the time to plant, the time to raise again,
   This man by treble diligence hath brought to light with paine._

The portraits of the Lord Chancellor BACON are well known; but in Mr.Montagu's late edition of his works, a new or juvenile portrait is
added, namely, a most expressive, intelligent, and beautiful miniature
of him at his age of eighteen, by Hilyard, of whom Dr.Donne said,

         ----_a hand or eye
   By Hilyard drawn, is worth a history
   By a worse painter._

This fine edition of his works is illustrated by five portraits, taken
at different periods of his lordship's life; by engravings of his
residence, and monument, fac-similes, and other embellishments.In
Mallett's edition are two portraits, one by Vertue, finely
engraved.[62]

GERARDE'S portrait (a fine one) is prefixed to his own edition of his
Herbal.No painter, or engraver's
name, except the initials, W. R. intertwined, which I suppose are those
of W. Rogers, the engraver.There is another good head of Gerarde, a
small oval one, in the title page to Johnson's edition.A portrait, in
oil, of Gerarde, was sold by Mr.Pulteney
reviews both these Herbals.Gerarde is highly extolled by Dr.Bulleyn,
and indeed attained deserved eminence in his day.Pulteney relates
that "the thousand novelties which were brought into England by our
circumnavigators, Raleigh and Cavendish, in 1580 and 1588, excited a
degree of attention, which at this day cannot, without the aid of
considerable recollection, be easily conceived.Raleigh himself appears
to have possessed a larger share of taste for the curious productions of
nature, than was common to the seafaring adventurers of that period.And
posterity will rank these voyagers among the greatest benefactors to
this kingdom, in having been the means, if tradition may be credited, of
introducing the most useful root that Providence has held forth for the
service of man.A voyage round the globe, howsoever familiarized in
ours, was, in that age, a most interesting and fruitful occasion of
enquiry.The return of Raleigh, and the fame of his manifold discoveries
and collections, brought over from the continent the celebrated Clusius,
then in the fifty-fifth year of his age.He, who added more to the stock
of botany, in his day, than all his contemporaries united, visited
England for the third time, to partake, at this critical juncture, in
the general gratification.At this eventful period, Gerarde was in the
vigour of life, and, without doubt, felt the influence, and reaped
the advantage of all the circumstances I have enumerated."One
of the editions of Gerarde thus appears in a bookseller's
catalogue:--"Gerarde's Herball; or Generall Historie of Plants, very
much enlarged by Johnson, folio, _beautiful impression of the
frontispiece by Payne, fine copy, old Russia, gilt back, L3.[63]


WALTER BLYTHE'S whole-length portrait (exhibiting a pensive and
penetrating aspect), is prefixed to his "English Improver Improved;" and
which work Professor Martyn terms "an original and incomparable work for
the time."Beale calls him "honest Captain Blithe."GERVASE MARKHAM'S portrait is prefixed to his "Perfect Horseman;" 8vo.It is re-engraved for Richardson's portraits to Granger.Markham
appears to have been a good soldier, as well as a good scholar.1623, "The Country House-Wife's Garden."He wrote
Herod and Antipater, a tragedy.Langbaine speaks very much in his
praise, and seemingly not without reason.Dibden, in his "Library
Companion," says, "on many accounts does Markham seem entitled to more
notice and commendation."He translated Leibault's Maison Rustique, in
1616, in 4to.or small folio, and augmented it with many additions from
Oliver de Serres, and others.Weston, in his Catalogue, says he
re-printed the editions in 1614 and 1631, of Barnaby Gooche's Husbandry.He published many books on husbandry, on fowling, on angling, on
military discipline, on horsemanship.Many of their titles are
enumerated in Langbaine, and in Weston, and they appear all to be more
fully stated in Watts's Bibl.Much information, as to Markham, may
be seen in vol.of the Censura Literaria; and in Sir E. Brydges's
edition of Phillips's Theatrum Poetarum Anglicanorum, appears, perhaps,
the best list of his works, with a brief memoir.[64]


PARKINSON'S excellent portrait, by Marshall, appears in the title page
to his _Theatrum Botanicum_, in 1640.Some one _may_ now possess the
original.In his _Paradisus_, 1635, there is a very scurvy engraving of
his healthy, and hearty-looking old countenance.In this miserable cut,
which is on wood, the graver, Christopher Switzer, does not seem to have
had a strife "_with nature to outdo the life_."Marshall's head is
re-engraved for Richardson's Illustrations to Granger.Parkinson rose to
such a degree of reputation, as to be appointed Apothecary to King
James.He was appointed herbalist to Charles I. Dr.Pulteney speaks
highly of both the above works, particularly of the _Theatrum_.All the
memorials we have of the private history of this most industrious and
zealous herbalist, are very scanty.He died about 1645, aged about 78.The curious contents of his _Paradisus_ are diffusively narrated in
Johnson's English Gardening.When perusing the pages of either of the
above, one may exclaim,

                           ----"not a tree,
   A plant, a leaf, a blossom, but contains
   A folio volume.We may read, and read,
   And read again; and still find something new,
   Something to please, and something to instruct,
   E'en in the humble weed."[Illustration]

The above is scarcely better than Switzer's.There appears no faithful
portrait of Parkinson, but Marshall's, who _had the felicity_ to draw
other portraits besides his.Hollar's striking portraits of the TRADESCANTS, are well known.On their
tomb, at Lambeth, the following lines form part of the inscription:--

   These famous Antiquarians, that had been
   Both Gardeners to the rose and lily Queen,
   Transplanted now themselves, sleep here; and when
   Angels shall with their trumpets waken men,
   And fire shall purge the world, these hence shall rise,
   And change this Garden for a Paradise.In the Ashmolean Museum, is a portrait of the SON, _in his garden_, with
a spade in his hand.Nichols's "Illustrations to Granger,"
consisting of seventy-five portraits, appear those of the Tradescants,
father and son.Smith also engraved John Tradescant, with his son, and
their monument, 1793.Weston, in his Catalogue, fully describes the
_Museum Tradescantium_.Pulteney observes, that "in a work devoted
to the commemoration of Botanists, their name stands too high not to
demand an honourable notice; since they contributed, at an early period,
by their garden and museum, to raise a curiosity that was eminently
useful to the progress and improvement of natural history in general.The reader may see a curious account of the remains of this garden,
drawn up in the year 1749, by the late Sir W. Watson, and printed in
vol.His widow erected a
curious monument, in memory of the family, in Lambeth church-yard, of
which a large account, and engravings from a drawing of it in the
Pepysian Library, at Cambridge, are given by the late learned Dr.SIR HENRY WOTTON, Provost of Eaton.His portrait is given in Isaac
Walton's Lives of Wotton, and others.It, of course, accompanies
Zouch's, and the other well-known editions of Isaac Walton's Lives.In
Evans's Illustrations to Granger, is Sir H. Wotton, from the picture in
the Bodleian Library, engraved by _Stow_.In Sir Henry's Reflections on
Ancient and Modern Learning, is his chapter "On Ancient and Modern
Agriculture and Gardening."Cowley wrote an elegy on him, which thus
commences:--

   What shall we say since silent now is he,
   Who when he spoke, all things would silent be;
   Who had so many languages in store,
   That only Fame can speak of him with more.Isaac Walton published the "_Reliquiae Wottonianae_, or, Lives, Letters,
Poems, &c. by Sir Henry Wotton," 12mo.1654, with portraits of Wotton,
Charles I., Earl of Essex, and Buckingham.Sir E. Brydges printed at his
private press, at Lee Priory, Sir Henry's Characters of the Earl of
Essex and Buckingham.In the _Reliquiae_, among many curious and
interesting articles, is preserved Sir Henry's delicately complimentary
letter to Milton on receiving from him _Comus_.Sir Henry, when a
resident at Venice, (where he was sent on three several embassies by
James) purchased for that munificent encourager of painting, the Duke of
Buckingham, several valuable pictures, which were added to the Duke's
magnificent collection.Isaac Walton's Life of Wotton thus
concludes:--"Dying worthy of his name and family, worthy of the love of
so many princes, and persons of eminent wisdom and learning, worthy of
the trust committed unto him for the service of his prince and country."And, in his Angler, he thus sweetly paints the warm attachment he had
for Wotton:--"a man with whom I have often fished and conversed, whose
learning, wit, and cheerfulness, made his company to be esteemed one of
the delights of mankind.Peace and patience, and a calm content, did
cohabit in the cheerful heart of Sir Henry Wotton."Dallaway, in his Anecdotes of the Arts, mentions
the following portrait of Sir Thomas:--"At Devonshire-house is a family
groupe, by Dobson, of Sir Thomas Browne.He is smiling with the utmost
complacency upon his children, who surround him."His portrait is also
prefixed to his works.Dict., folio, 1748, says, "his
picture, in the College of Physicians, shews him to have been remarkably
handsome, and to have possessed, in a singular degree, the blessings of
a grave, yet cheerful and inviting, countenance."The same work farther
gives him a most amiable character.Ray, in his Ornithology, does
not omit paying a just compliment to his assistant and friend, "the
deservedly famous Sir Thomas Browne."Evelyn, in 1671, mentions Sir
Thomas Browne's garden at Norwich, as containing a paradise of
varieties, and the gardens of all the inhabitants as full of excellent
flowers.Switzer says, "The noble elegance of his style has since
induced many to read his works, (of which, that of _Cyrus's gardens_ is
some of the brightest,) though they have had little inclination to the
practice of gardening itself.There remains nothing that I have heard of
his putting gardening actually into practice himself; but some of his
last works being observations on several scarce plants mentioned in
Scripture; and of Garlands and Coronary garden plants and flowers, 'tis
reasonable to suppose he did; and the love he had so early and late
discovered toward it, was completed in the delightful practice thereof."He further says, " his elaborate and ingenious pen has not a little
added to the nobleness of our subject."[65] His works were published in
1 vol.folio, 1686, with his portrait, engraved by White.His portrait
appears also to his "Certain Miscellany Tracts," 8vo.A list of his
numerous works may be seen in the Biogr.Dictionaires, or in Watts's
Bibl.It is so masterly written, that it is impossible to give even an
abstract.Kippis has, however, in part, transcribed it.He was
chosen Honorary Fellow of the College of Physicians, as a man _virtute
et literas ornatissimus_.In 1671, he received the honour of Knighthood
from Charles II., a prince, (says Dr.Johnson) "who, with many frailties
and vices, had yet skill to discover excellence, and virtue to reward it
with such honorary distinctions, at least, as cost him nothing, yet,
conferred by a king so judicious and so much beloved, had the power of
giving merit new lustre and greater popularity."Thus he lived in high
reputation, till, in his seventy-sixth year, an illness, which tortured
him a week, put an end to his life, at Norwich, on his birth-day,
October 19, 1682."Some of his last words (we are told by _Whitefoot_)
were expressions of submission to the will of God, and fearlessness of
death."Johnson observes, "It is not on the praises of others, but
on his own writings, that he is to depend for the esteem of posterity;
of which he will not be easily deprived, while learning shall have any
reverence among men: for there is no science in which he does not
discover some skill; and scarce any kind of knowledge, profane or
sacred, abstruse or elegant, which he does not appear to have cultivated
with success.His exuberance of knowledge, and plenitude of ideas,
sometimes obstruct the tendency of his reasoning, and the clearness of
his decisions.On whatever subject he employed his mind, there started
up immediately so many images before him, that he lost one by grasping
another.His memory supplied him with so many illustrations, parallel or
dependent notions, that he was always starting into collateral
considerations.But the spirit and vigour of his pursuit always gives
delight; and the reader follows him, without reluctance, through his
mazes, of themselves flowery and pleasing, and ending at the point
originally in view.There remains yet an objection against the writings
of _Browne_, more formidable than the animadversions of criticism.There
are passages from which some have taken occasion to rank him among
deists, and others among atheists.It would be difficult to guess how
any such conclusion should be formed, had not experience shewn that
there are two sorts of men willing to enlarge the catalogue of infidels.When _Browne_ has been numbered among the contemners of religion by the
fury of its friends, or the artifices of its enemies, it is no difficult
task to replace him among the most zealous professors of christianity.He may perhaps, in the ardour of his imagination, have hazarded an
expression, which a mind intent upon faults may interpret into heresy,
if considered apart from the rest of his discourse; but a phrase is not
to be opposed to volumes.There is scarcely a writer to be found, whose
profession was not divinity, that has so frequently testified his belief
of the sacred writings, has appealed to them with such unlimited
submission, or mentioned them with such unvaried reverence."His portrait by Nanteuil, and that by Kneller, holding
his _Sylva_ in his hand, are well engraved in Mr.The
following remark is from the Quarterly Review, in its review of the same
work, in 1818:--"At four years old he was taught to read by the parish
school-master, whose school was over the church porch; and 'at six his
picture was drawn by one Chanteral, no ill painter.'If this portrait,
as is not unlikely, be preserved in the family, it should have been
engraved for the present work; it would have been very interesting to
compare the countenance of such a person, in childhood, in the flower of
years, when his head was engraved by Nanteuil, and in ripe old age, when
he sat to Sir G.Evelyn, and his family, and he gives a
list of his works.He says "his picture was thrice drawn in oil; first,
in 1641, by one Vanderborcht, brought out of Germany at the same time
with Hollar, the graver, by the Earl of Arundel; a second time in 1648,
by Walker; and the third time by Sir G. Kneller, for his friend Mr.Pepys, of the Admiralty, of which that at the Royal Society is a copy.There is a print of him by Nanteuil, who likewise drew him more than
once in black and white, with Indian ink; and a picture, in crayon, by
Luterel."Evelyn lived in the busy times of Charles I., Cromwell,
Charles II., James II., and William.He had much personal intercourse
with Charles II.and James II., and was in the habits of great intimacy
with many of the ministers of those two monarchs, and of the eminent men
of those days.Foreigners, distinguished for learning or arts, who came
to England, did not leave it without visiting him.His manners we may
presume to have been of the most agreeable kind, for his company was
sought by the greatest men, not merely by inviting him to their own
tables, but by their repeated visits to him at his own house.Evelyn
lived to the great age of eighty-six, and wished these words to be
inscribed on his tomb:--"all is vanity that is not honest, and there is
no solid wisdom but in real piety."[66] Cowley, in a letter to him,
says, "I know nobody that possesses more private happiness than you do
in your garden; and yet no man who makes his happiness more publick, by
a free communication of the art and knowledge of it to others.All that
I myself am able yet to do, is only to recommend to mankind the search
of that felicity, which you instruct them how to find and to enjoy."The
Quarterly Review thus speaks of his _Sylva_:--"The Sylva remained a
beautiful and enduring memorial of his amusements, his occupations, and
his studies, his private happiness, and his public virtues.The greater
part of the woods, which were raised in consequence of Evelyn's
writings, have been cut down; the oaks have borne the British flag to
seas and countries which were undiscovered when they were planted, and
generation after generation has been coffined in the elms.The trees of
his age, which may yet be standing, are verging fast toward their decay
and dissolution: but his name is fresh in the land, and his reputation,
like the trees of an Indian Paradise, exists, and will continue to exist
in full strength and beauty, uninjured by the course of time."of Gardening, thus speaks of him:--"Evelyn is
universally allowed to have been one of the warmest friends to
improvements in gardening and planting, that has ever appeared.He is
eulogized by Wotton, in his _Reflections on Ancient and Modern
Learning_, as having done more than all former ages."Switzer calls him
"that good esquire, the king of gardeners."Walpole)
"was a course of inquiry, study, curiosity, instruction, and
benevolence.He knew that retirement, in his own hands, was industry and
benefit to mankind; in those of others, laziness and inutility."There appears the following more modern publications respecting Mr.Sylva, with Notes by Hunter; in 4to, and 8vo.Another edition, in 2
vols., 4to.Evelyn's Miscellaneous Writings, collected and edited, with Notes, by
Mr.Forming a Supplement to the Evelyn Memoirs.of Gardening enumerates the whole of Mr.Johnson in his History of
English Gardening.[67]

ABRAHAM COWLEY.That in Bishop
Hurd's edition is very neat.This same portrait is also well engraved
for Ankars's edition of Cowley; and also in that by Aikens, in 8vo.Dean
Sprat has prefixed to his edition of Cowley, his portrait, engraved by
Faithorne, and, in his preface, pays a warm and just tribute to his
memory.When his death was announced to Charles II., he declared, that
Mr.Cowley had not left a better man behind him in England.Cowley
addresses his chapter _Of Gardens_ (which strongly paints his delight in
them) to Mr.He wrote this epitaph for himself:--

   From life's superfluous cares enlarg'd,
   His debt of human toil discharg'd,
   Here COWLEY lies, beneath this shed,
   To ev'ry worldly interest _dead_:
   With decent poverty content;
   His hours of ease not idly spent;
   To fortune's goods a foe profess'd,
   And, hating wealth, by all caress'd.'Tis sure he's _dead_; for, lo!how small
   A spot of earth is now his all!wish that earth may lightly lay,
   And ev'ry care be far away!Bring flow'rs, the short-liv'd roses bring,
   To _life deceased_ fit offering!And sweets around the poet strow,
   Whilst yet with life his ashes glow.JOHN ROSE, head gardener to the Lord Essex, at Essex-house, in the
Strand.He sent him to study the celebrated beauties in the gardens of
Versailles.He became afterwards the chief gardener to Charles II., at
the royal gardens in St.His portrait may be seen at
Kensington, in an oil painting, where he is presenting a pine to his
Majesty, whilst on a visit to the Duchess of Cleveland, at Downey Court,
Buckinghamshire.It has lately been engraved in mezzotinto.He was the
author of "The English Vineyard Vindicated, and the Way of Making Wine
in France;" first printed with Evelyn's French Gardener, in 1672, 12mo.Other editions in 1675, 1676, and 1690, in 8vo.The preface is by
Evelyn, as well as The Art of Making Wine.Rose brought to great
perfection dwarf fruit trees, in the gardens at Hampton Court, Carlton,
and Marlborough House.Switzer thus speaks of him:--"He was esteemed to
be the best of his profession in those days, and ought to be remembered
for the encouragement he gave to a servant of his, that has since made
the greatest figure that ever yet any gardener did, I mean Mr.Rose may be well ranked amongst the greatest virtuosos of that time,
(now dead) who were all well pleased to accept of his company while
living."He published "The Planter's Manual," 12mo.There
is prefixed to it a rural frontispiece, by Van Houe.Johnson
properly calls him "one of the _Scriptores minores_ of horticulture."His "devoted attachment to Izaak Walton, forms the best evidence we have
of his naturally amiable disposition."Major's extensively illustrated and most attractive editions of
the Angler; a delightful book, exhibiting a "matchless picture of rural
nature."Cotton's portrait is also well engraved in Zouch's Life of
Walton; and in the many other curious and embellished editions of Walton
and Cotton's Angler.He translated with such truth and spirit, the
celebrated Essays of Montaigne, that he received from that superior
critic, the Marquis of Halifax, a most elegant encomium.Sir John
Hawkins calls it "one of the most valuable books in the English
language."Cotton's works appears in Watts's
Bibl.When describing, in his _Wonders of the Peake_, the Queen
of Scot's Pillar, he thus breaks out:--

   Illustrious _Mary_, it had happy been,
   Had you then found a cave like this to skreen
   Your sacred person from those frontier spies,
   That of a sovereign princess durst make prize,
   When Neptune too officiously bore
   Your cred'lous innocence to this faithless shore.once who hadst the only fame
   Of being kind to all who hither came
   For refuge and protection, how couldst thou
   So strangely alter thy good nature now,
   Where there was so much excellence to move,
   Not only thy compassion, but thy love?'Twas strange on earth, save _Caledonian_ ground,
   So impudent a villain could be found,
   Such majesty and sweetness to accuse;
   Or, after that, a judge would not refuse
   Her sentence to pronounce; or that being done,
   Even amongst bloody'st hangmen, to find one
   Durst, though her face was veil'd, and neck laid down,
   Strike off the fairest head e'er wore a crown.And what state policy there might be here,
   Which does with right too often interfere,
   I'm not to judge: yet thus far dare be bold,
   A fouler act the sun did ne'er behold.[68]

Plott, in his Staffordshire, calls Mr.Cotton "his worthy, learned, and
most ingenious friend."Sir John Hawkins thus speaks of him:--"He was
both a wit and a scholar; of an open, cheerful, and hospitable temper;
endowed with fine talents for conversation, and the courtesy and
affability of a gentleman."He farther thus speaks of one of his
poems:--"It is not for their courtly and elegant turn, that the verses
of Charles Cotton ought to be praised; there is such a delightful flow
of feeling and sentiment, so much of the best part of our nature mixed
up in them, and so much fancy displayed, that one of our most
distinguished living poets has adduced several passages of his Ode upon
Winter, for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy."He
must have possessed many endearing qualities, for the benevolent and
pious Walton thus concludes a letter to his "most honoured friend,
Charles Cotton, Esq.:"--"though I be more than a hundred miles from you,
and in the eighty-third year of my age, yet I will forget both, and next
month begin a pilgrimage to beg your pardon: for I would die in your
favour, and till then will live, Sir, your most affectionate father and
friend, Isaac Walton."One cannot wonder at the good old man wishing to
visit the courteous and well-bred Mr.Cotton, and to enjoy the
intercourse of hospitable urbanity, near the pastoral streams of the
Dove, when he had received such an invitation as the following,
addressed to his "dear and most worthy friend, Mr.Isaac Walton:"--

   Whilst in this cold and blustering clime,
     Where bleak winds howl and tempests roar,
   We pass away the roughest time
     Has been of many years before;

   Whilst from the most tempestuous nooks
     The chillest blasts our peace invade,
   And by great rains our smallest brooks
     Are almost navigable made;

   Whilst all the ills are so improved,
     Of this dead quarter of the year,
   That even you, so much beloved,
     We would not now wish with us here;

   In this estate, I say, it is
     Some comfort to us to suppose,
   That, in a better clime than this,
     You, our dear friend, have more repose;

   And some delight to me the while,
     Though nature now does weep in rain,
   To think that I have seen her smile,
     And haply may I do again.If the all-ruling Power please
     We live to see another May,
   We'll recompense an age of these
     Foul days in one fine fishing day.We then shall have a day or two,
     Perhaps a week, wherein to try
   What the best master's hand can do
     With the most deadly killing fly:

   A day with not too bright a beam,
     A warm, but not a scorching sun,
   A southern gale to curl the stream,
     and, master, half our work is done.There, whilst behind some bush we wait
     The scaly people to betray,--
   We'll prove it just, with treacherous bait
     To make the preying _Trout_ our prey.And think ourselves, in such an hour,
     Happier than those, though not so high,
   Who, like _Leviathans_, devour
     Of meaner men the smaller fry.This, my best friend, at my poor home
     Shall be our pastime and our theme;
   But then--should you not deign to come,
     You make all this a flattering dream.In wandering over the lovely scenes, the pleasant brooks, the
flower-bespangled meadows, which the moral pages of Isaac Walton so
unaffectedly delineate, it is impossible not to recur to the name of the
late author of _Salmonia_, and to reflect, that on these pages he oft
unbended his vigorous mind from his severe and brilliant discoveries.We
can now only lament the (almost) premature death of this high-ranked
philosopher, this great benefactor to the arts, and deep promoter of
science, whose mortal remains were consigned to his unostentatious tomb,
at Geneva, in one of the finest evenings of summer, followed by the
eloquent and amiable historian, De Sismondi, and by other learned and
illustrious men.One may apply to his last moments at Geneva, (where he
had arrived only one day before) these lines of his own favourite
Herbert:--

   _Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,
     The bridal of the earth and sky,
   Sweet dews shall weep thy fall to-night,
     For thou must die!_[69]


SAMUEL GILBERT'S portrait is prefixed to his "Florist's Vade Mecum;"
12mo.In his "Gardener's Almanack," is a particular description of the
roses cultivated in the English gardens at that period.He was the
author of "Fons Sanitatis, or the Healing Spring at Willowbridge Wells."He was son-in-law to John Rea, the author of Flora, and who planned the
gardens at Gerard's Bromley.Willowbridge Wells are at a little distance
from where these once superb gardens were.JACOB BOBART, the elder, is an admirable portrait, by D. Loggan, taken
at his age of eighty-one, and engraved by Burghers.Beneath the head, which is dated 1675, is this
distich:--

   _Thou Germane prince of plants, each year to thee,
   Thousands of subjects grant a subsidy._

It is a venerable countenance, of deep thought.Richardson re-engraved
this among his Illustrations to Granger.Granger mentions also a
whole-length of Bobart in a garden, dog, goat, &c.of
Gardening says, "Bobart's descendants are still in Oxford, and known as
coach proprietors."The
munificence of the Earl of Danby placed Bobart in the physic garden at
Oxford, in 1632, as supervisor; and this garden flourished many years
under his care, and that of his son Jacob, whose zeal and diligence Dr.The elder Bobart was the author of the _Hortus
Oxoniensis_, 1648.Wood, in his Athenae, informs us, that "Jacob Bobart
died in his garden-house, in February, 1679, whereupon his body was
buried in the church of St.He left two sons, _Jacob_ and
_Tillemant_.Tillemant became a master coachman between Oxford and
London, but having had the misfortune to break his leg, became one of
the beadles of the university.Nicholls's late
curious work on autographs, among other _albums_, in the British Museum,
it mentions that of David Krein, in which is the autograph of Jacob
Bobart, with these verses;--

             ----"virtus sua gloria.Think that day lost whose descending sun
   Views from thy hand no noble action done.Yr success and happyness
               is sincerely wished by
                     Ja.It appears from Ray's History of Plants, that Jacob Bobart, the son, was
a frequent communicator to him of scarce plants.It was this son who
published the second volume of Morrison's Oxford History of Plants, who
wrote its excellent preface, and who engaged _Burghers_ to engrave many
of the new plants; which engravings are highly commended by Pulteney.Johnson, in page 148 of his History of Gardening, thus pays Bobart a
high compliment:--"a phalanx of botanists were then contemporaries,
which previous ages never equalled, nor succeeding ones surpassed.Ray,
Tournefort, Plumier, Plukenet, Commelin, Rivinus, _Bobart_, Petiver,
Sherard, Boccone, Linnaeus, may be said to have lived in the same age."His portrait is engraved by Vertue, from after Verelst,
and prefixed to his translation of _Rapin on Gardens_, 8vo.I believe he also wrote
"On the Beatitudes;" 2 vols.Switzer says, that this "incomparable
Latin poem was translated by an ingenious and worthily dignified
clergyman, and a great lover of gardening, Mr.Gardiner, Sub-Dean of
Lincoln."He became afterwards (I believe) Bishop of Lincoln; and a
Latin epitaph on this bishop is in Peck's _Desid.Curiosa._ There is a
print of "Jacobus Gardiner, Episc.Lincoln," engraved by George White,
from after Dahl.Vanderbane's engraving, from Sir Peter Lely's, is particularly fine.Vertue's engravings, from Sir Peter, in the folio editions of 1720 and
1740, are also fine.This same portrait is neatly engraved in the late
Mr.Houbraken has also engraved the same
for Birch's Lives.Sir William Temple, after spending twenty years in
negociations with foreign powers, retired in 1680 from public life, and
employed his time in literary pursuits.He was ambassador for many years
at the court of Holland, and there acquired his knowledge and taste in
gardening.He had a garden at Sheen, and afterwards, another at Moor
Park, where he died in 1700; and though his body was buried in
Westminster Abbey, his heart was enclosed in a silver urn under a
sun-dial in the latter garden.His Essay "Upon the Gardens of Epicurus,
or of Gardening in the year 1685," is printed in all the editions of his
works.[70] These works are published in 2 vols.Switzer, in his History of Gardening, first published in 1715, says,
"That he was a great lover of gardening, appears by his own writings,
and several kinds of fruit brought over by him out of Holland, &c. as
well as by the testimony of his neighbours _yet living_, the greatest
consolation of his life being, in the lucid intervals he had from public
employs, in his beloved gardens at _Sheen_."And, in his Fruit Gardener
he says, that "the magnificence and generosity of this great lover of
planting, distributed vast numbers of the finest grapes among the
nurserymen about London, as well as amongst the nobility and gentry."Lord Mountmorris thus speaks of him:--"The retirement of this great man
has bequeathed the most invaluable legacy to posterity.Of the taste and
elegance of his writings too much can never be said, illuminated as they
are by that probity and candour which pervade them, and those charms
which render truth irresistible.Though other writers may be more the
objects of imitation to the scholar, yet his style is certainly the best
adapted to the politician and the man of fashion; nor would such an
opinion be given, were it not for an anecdote of Swift, which I had from
the late Mr.Sheridan, who told me the dean always recommended him as
the best model, and had repeatedly said that the style of Sir William
Temple was the easiest, the most liberal, and the most brilliant
in our language.In a word, when we consider his probity, his
disinterestedness, his contempt of wealth, the genuine beauty of his
style, which was as brilliant, as harmonious, and as pure as his life
and manners; when we reflect upon the treasures which he has bequeathed
by his example and by his works to his country, which no man ever loved
better, or esteemed more; we cannot avoid considering Sir William Temple
as one of the greatest characters which has appeared upon the political
stage; and he may be justly classed with the greatest names of
antiquity, and with the most brilliant characters which adorn and
illustrate the Grecian or Roman annals."Mason, in his English
Garden, contrasts Sir William's idea of "a perfect garden," with those
of Lord Bacon, and Milton; but he candidly says,

                        ----and yet full oft
   O'er Temple's studious hour did truth preside,
   Sprinkling her lustre o'er his classic page;
   There hear his candour own, in fashion's spite,
   In spite of courtly dulness hear it own,
   _There is a grace in wild variety
   Surpassing rule and order._ Temple, yes,
   There is a grace; and let eternal wreaths
   Adorn their brows who fixt its empire here."He then, in glowing lines, pays an animated tribute to Addison, Pope,
and Kent.Hume records that "he was full of honour and humanity."Sir
William thus concludes one of his philosophic essays:--"When this is
done, human life is, at the greatest and the best, but like a froward
child, that must be played with and humoured a little to keep it quiet
till it falls asleep, and then the care is over."His garden was one of
his last delights.He knew what kind of life was best fitted to make a
man's last days happy.Walpole, though he censures Sir William's
warm panegyric on the garden at Moor Park, yet scruples not doing him
full justice, in styling him an excellent man, and an admired writer,
whose style, as to his garden, is animated with the colouring and glow
of poetry.Cobbett, in his _English Gardener_, thus deplores the
fate of Moor Park:--"This really wise and excellent man, Sir W. Temple,
who, while he possessed the soundest judgment, and was employed in some
of the greatest concerns of his country, so ardently, yet so rationally
and unaffectedly, praises the pursuits of gardening, in which he
delighted from his youth to his old age; and of his taste in which, he
gave such delightful proofs in those gardens and grounds at Moor Park,
beneath the turf of one spot of which, he caused by his will, his heart
to be buried, and which spot, together with all the rest of the
beautiful arrangement, has been torn about and disfigured within the
last fifty years, by a succession of wine merchants, spirit merchants,
West Indians, and God knows what besides."And, in his _Woodlands_, he
says, "I have stood for hours, when a little boy, looking at this object
(the canal and borders of beautiful flowers at Moor Park); I have
travelled far since, and have seen a great deal; but I have never seen
any thing of the gardening kind so beautiful in the whole course of my
life."Johnson, in his History of English Gardening, after noticing
many general particulars of Sir William, devotes an interesting page to
Sir William's attachment to gardening; and every line in this generous
page, betrays his own delight in this art.He thus concludes this
page:--"Nothing can demonstrate more fully the delight he took in
gardening, than the direction left in his will, that his heart should be
buried beneath the sun-dial of his garden, at Moor Park, near Farnham,
in Surrey.In accordance with which, it was deposited there in a silver
box, affording another instance of the ruling passion unweakened even in
death.Nor was this an unphilosophical clinging to that which it was
impossible to retain; but rather that grateful feeling, common to our
nature, of desiring finally to repose where in life we have been happy.In his garden, Sir William Temple had spent the calmest hours of a
well-spent life, and where his heart had been most peaceful, he wished
its dust to mingle, and thus, at the same time, offering his last
testimony to the sentiment, that in a garden

   _Hic secura quies, et nescia fallere vita._"

JOHN LOCKE wrote "Observations upon the Growth of Vines and Olives; the
Production of Silk, the Preservation of Fruits.Written at the request
of the Earl of Shaftesbury; now first printed from the original
manuscript in the possession of the present Earl of Shaftesbury, 1s.Among the many portraits we have of this learned man, the
public are indebted to Lord King, for having prefixed to his Life of Mr.Locke, a very fine portrait of him, from after Greenhill.This great and
good man possessed, in the highest degree, those virtues that have
given him a claim to the highest rank in the admiration of posterity.In
Rutter's delineations of a part of Somersetshire, he gives a neat
wood-cut of the cottage at Wrington, wherein Locke was born, and he
informs us, that in the garden belonging to Mrs.Hannah More, near that
village, she has placed an urn commemorative of Locke, which was a gift
to her from the justly celebrated Mrs.He was drawn also by
Kneller.Bromley gives a list of many of his engraved portraits.Houbraken engraved one for Birch's Lives.Vertue gave two engravings
from Kneller.WILLIAM FLEETWOOD, successively Bishop of St.Asaph and Ely, and who
died in 1723, was author of "Curiosities of Nature and Art in Husbandry
and Gardening," 8vo.His portrait is prefixed to his "Sermons on
the Relative Duties," 8vo.1716; and also to his "Essay on the
Miracles."His works were published in a collected form in 1 vol.He was incontestibly the best preacher in his time.Doddridge
calls him "silver tongued."Pope's line of

   _The gracious dew of pulpit eloquence_,

might, no doubt, have been justly applied to him.Drake, in the
third volume of his Essays, to illustrate the Tatler, Spectator, and
Guardian, has some interesting pages respecting him.His benevolent
heart and exemplary life, added great effect to his persuasive eloquence
in the pulpit."His sermons (says Lempriere), and divinity tracts, were
widely circulated; but the firmness of his opinions drew upon him the
censure of the House of Commons.His preface to his sermons on the
deaths of Mary, the Duke of Gloucester, and of William, and on the
accession of Anne, gave such offence to the ministry, that the book was
publicly burnt in 1712; but it was more universally read, and even
appeared in the Spectator, No.Johnson
remarked, that fire is a conclusive, but not a convincing argument; it
will certainly destroy any book, but it refutes none.[71] In an
_Obituary_, preserved in Peck's Desid.Curiosa, it thus mentions the
death of a Jeffery Fleetwood, "leaving a wife and six little children
behind him.One of these little children was the famous
William Fleetwood, Bishop of Ely."JOSEPH ADDISON, Esq.There is an original portrait of this eminent man,
at Holland House.Noble's continuation of Granger
enumerates several engravings of him, from Kneller's portraits.Dayl,
the painter, also drew him.In
Ireland's "Picturesque Views on the River Avon," he gives an interesting
description of Mr.Addison's house at Bilton, near Rugby, two miles from
Dunchurch; with a view of the same.The house "remains precisely in the
state it was at the decease of its former possessor, nor has the
interior suffered much change in its former decoration.The furniture
and pictures hold their places with an apparent sacred attention to his
memory.Among the latter, are three of himself, at different periods of
his life; in each of which is strongly marked with the pencil, the ease
of the gentleman, and the open and ingenuous character of the friend to
humanity."Drake's Biographical Sketch of Addison, it appears,
that these portraits were still remaining in his house in 1797.A copy
of the above view is given in the Monthly Magazine for February, 1822,
and it there says, that "the spacious gardens retain the fashion of the
age of the Spectator."The origin of the modern style of landscape
gardening, or the first writers on that subject, were unquestionably Mr.414 and 477 of the _Spectator_, and Mr.Pope in his
celebrated _Guardian_.The first artists who practised in this style,
were Bridgman and Kent.Addison's pure taste on these subjects
is visible even where he prefers Fontainebleau to the magnificent
Versailles, in his paper in the _Guardian_, No.101:--"It is situated
among rocks and woods, that give you a fine variety of savage prospects.The king has humoured the genius of the place, and only made use of so
much art as is necessary to help and regulate nature, without reforming
her too much.The cascades seem to break through the clefts and cracks
of rocks that are covered over with moss, and look as if they were piled
upon one another by accident.There is an artificial wildness in the
meadows, walks, and canals; and the garden, instead of a wall, is fenced
on the lower end by a natural mound of rock-work that strikes the eye
very agreeably.For my part, I think there is something more charming in
these rude heaps of stone than in so many statues, and would as soon see
a river winding through woods and meadows, as when it is tossed up in so
many whimsical figures at Versailles."414 of his Spectator, he
says, "English gardens are not so entertaining to the fancy as those in
France, and Italy, where we see a large extent of ground covered over
with an agreeable mixture of garden, and forest, which represent every
where an artificial rudeness, much more charming than that neatness and
elegancy which we meet with in those of our own country."Murphy
thus compares Addison with Johnson:--"Addison lends grace and ornament
to truth; Johnson gives it force and energy.Addison makes virtue
amiable; Johnson represents it as an awful duty."Addison has been
called the English Fenelon.Johnson calls him the Raphael of essay
writers.The imposing and commanding attitude of the statue erected a
few years since in the Poets' Corner, seems to have arisen, and to have
been devoted to his memory, from his _Reflections on the Tombs in the
Abbey_.Those reflections I here subjoin; and I am sure my reader will
agree with me, that I could not offer a purer honour to his genius and
memory:--"No.26, Friday, March 30._Pallida mors aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas
     Regumque turres, O beate sexti.Vitae summa brevis spem nos vetat inchoare longam,
     Jam te premet nox, fabulaeque manes,
   Et domus exilis Plutonia._--HOR.With equal foot, rich friend, impartial fate
   Knocks at the cottage, and the palace gate:
   Life's span forbids thee to extend thy cares,
   And stretch thy hopes beyond thy tender years:
   Night soon will seize, and you must quickly go
   To storied ghosts, and _Pluto's_ house below.--CREECH."When I am in a serious humour, I very often walk by myself in
Westminster Abbey; where the gloominess of the place, and the use to
which it is applied, with the solemnity of the building, and the
condition of the people who lie in it, are apt to fill the mind with a
kind of melancholy, or rather thoughtfulness, that is not disagreeable.I yesterday passed a whole afternoon in the church-yard, the cloisters,
and the church, amusing myself with the tomb-stones and inscriptions
that I met with in those several regions of the dead.Most of them
recorded nothing else of the buried person, but that he was born upon
one day and died upon another: the whole history of his life being
comprehended in those two circumstances, that are common to all mankind.I could not but look upon these registers of existence, whether of brass
or marble, as a kind of satire upon the departed persons; who had left
no other memorial of them, but that they were born and that they died.They put me in mind of several persons mentioned in the battles of
heroic poems, who have sounding names given them, for no other reason
but that they may be killed, and are celebrated for nothing but being
knocked on the head._Glaucumque, Medontaque, Thersilochumque._--VIRG."The life of these men is finely described in holy writ by _the path of
an arrow_, which is immediately closed up and lost.Upon my going into
the church, I entertained myself with the digging of a grave; and saw in
every shovel-full of it that was thrown up, the fragment of a bone or
skull intermixed with a kind of fresh mouldering earth that some time or
other had a place in the composition of an human body.Upon this I began
to consider with myself what innumerable multitudes of people lay
confused together under the pavement of that ancient cathedral; how men
and women, friends and enemies, priests and soldiers, monks and
prebendaries, were crumbled amongst one another, and blended together in
the same common mass; how beauty, strength, and youth, with old age,
weakness, and deformity, lay undistinguished in the same promiscuous
heap of matter.After having thus surveyed this great magazine of
mortality, as it were in the lump; I examined it more particularly by
the accounts which I found on several of the monuments which are raised
in every quarter of that ancient fabrick.Some of them were covered with
such extravagant epitaphs, that if it were possible for the dead person
to be acquainted with them, he would blush at the praises which his
friends have bestowed upon him.There are others so excessively modest,
that they deliver the character of the person departed in _Greek_ or
_Hebrew_, and by that means are not understood once in a twelvemonth.In
the poetical quarter, I found there were poets who had no monuments, and
monuments which had no poets.I observed indeed that the present war had
filled the church with many of these uninhabited monuments, which had
been erected to the memory of persons whose bodies were buried in the
plains of _Blenheim_, or in the bosom of the ocean.I could not but be
very much delighted with several modern epitaphs, which are written with
great elegance of expression and justness of thought, and therefore do
honour to the living as well as to the dead.As a foreigner is very apt
to conceive an idea of the ignorance or politeness of a nation from the
turn of their public monuments and inscriptions, they should be
submitted to the perusal of men of learning and genius before they are
put in execution.Sir_Cloudesly Shovel's_ monument has very often given
me great offence: instead of the brave rough _English_ admiral, which
was the distinguishing character of that plain gallant man, he is
represented on his tomb by the figure of a beau, dressed in a long
periwig, and reposing himself upon velvet cushions under a canopy of
state.The inscription is answerable to the monument; for, instead of
celebrating the many remarkable actions he had performed in the service
of his country, it acquaints us only with the manner of his death, in
which it was impossible for him to reap any honour.The _Dutch_, whom we
are apt to despise for want of genius, shew an infinitely greater taste
of antiquity and politeness in their buildings and works of this nature,
than what we meet with in those of our own country.The monuments of
their admirals, which have been erected at the public expense, represent
them like themselves; and are adorned with rostral crowns and naval
ornaments, with beautiful festoons of sea-weed, shells, and coral.I have left the repository of our English
kings for the contemplation of another day, when I shall find my mind
disposed for so serious an amusement.I know that entertainments of this
nature are apt to raise dark and dismal thoughts in timorous minds, and
gloomy imaginations; but, for my own part, though I am always serious,
I do not know what it is to be melancholy; and can therefore take a view
of nature in her deep and solemn scenes, with the same pleasure as in
her most gay and delightful ones.By this means I can improve myself
with those objects which others consider with terror.When I look upon
the tombs of the great, every emotion of envy dies in me; when I read
the epitaphs of the beautiful, every inordinate desire goes out; when I
meet with the grief of parents upon a tomb-stone, my heart melts with
compassion; when I see the tomb of the parents themselves, I consider
the vanity of grieving for those whom we must quickly follow: When I see
kings lying by those who deposed them, when I consider rival wits placed
side by side, or the holy men that divided the world with their contests
and disputes, I reflect with sorrow and astonishment on the little
competitions, factions, and debates of mankind.When I read the several
dates of the tombs, of some that died yesterday, and some six hundred
years ago, I consider that great day when we shall all of us be
contemporaries, and make our appearance together.JOHN LAWRENCE published "The Clergyman's Recreation, shewing the
Pleasure and Profit of the Art of Gardening;" 8vo.Also a poem,
called "Paradise Regained, or the Art of Gardening;" 8vo.The
sixth edition of "The Clergyman's Recreation" has "the effigies of the
author, engraved by Vertue."I have seen eight copies of this sixth
edition, and in neither of them has this portrait been.No doubt the
collecting to form Granger's, has deprived each copy of its portrait.This is an expressive portrait, ornamented with a vine wreath, and with
a rich cornucopia or clusters of ripe fruit.The original picture from
which Vertue's print was taken, was at Pallion, near Durham, the seat of
his grandson, John Goodchild, Esq.In Rodd's catalogue of engraved
portraits, printed a few years ago, was "John Lawrence, prebend of
Salisbury, _original drawing by Vertue_, price 5s."Lawrence
published also, in folio, in 1726, his System of Agriculture and
Gardening.of his Literary Anecdotes, has given
a list of all his works, has preserved a few particulars respecting him,
and pays a just tribute to him.A list of his works may also be seen in
Watts's Bibl.of Gardening
informs us that he was "of a hospitable and benevolent disposition,
taking great pleasure in presenting a rich dessert of fruit to his
friends."He was presented to the rectory of Yelvertoft,
Northamptonshire, in 1703, "by the extraordinary uncommon bounty of a
generous patron."In 1721, he was presented to that of Bishop's
Wearmouth, Durham, where he died in 1732.He was also a prebend of
Salisbury.Lawrence thus enforces the pleasures of a garden, to his own
order:--"to make them happy by loving an innocent diversion, the
amusements of a garden being not only most delightful to those that love
them, but most wholesome to those that use them.A good man knows how to
recapitulate all his pleasures in a devout lifting up of his hands, his
eyes and his heart, to the great and bountiful author of nature, who
gives beauty, relish, and success to all our honest labours."His pen
likewise paints with "soft and tempting colours," the extreme beauty of
our fruit-trees, when clothed with their different coloured blossoms,
(what Lord Byron calls _the sweet and blooming fruits of
earth_):--"What a pleasing entertainment is it to the eye, to behold
the apricot in its full blossom, white as snow, and at the same time the
peach with its crimson-coloured blooms; both beginning to be
interspersed with green leaves!These are succeeded by the pear, the
cherry, and the plum, whose blossoms and leaves make a very beautiful
mixture in the spring; and it cannot be a less pleasant sight to see
clusters of swelling fruit all the summer, as the earnest of the full
gratification of another sense in autumn.And now we have come hither,
what painter can draw a landskip more charming and beautiful to the eye,
than an old Newington peach-tree laden with fruit in August, when the
sun has first begun to paint one side of the fruit with such soft and
tempting colours?The apricot, the pear, the cherry and plum, when they
appear in plenty as they ought, present themselves to the eye at the
time of ripening in very inviting blushes.In short, all the several
sorts of fruit trees have such pleasing varieties, that were there no
other sense to be gratified but the sight, they may vie with a parterre
even of the finest flowers."He thus mentions the month of _July_:--"How
beautiful and refreshing are the mornings and evenings of such days,
when the very air is perfumed with pleasant odours, and every thing that
presents itself to the eye gives fresh occasion to the devout admirer to
praise and adore the Great Creator, who hath given such wisdom and power
to man to diversify nature in such various instances, and (for his own
use, pleasure, and profit,) to assist her in all her operations."This
worthy clergyman might have applied to the delights of a garden, the
sacred words of scripture:--"her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all
her paths are peace."[75]

ALEXANDER POPE.Numerous are the engraved portraits of this graceful and
harmonious poet.Noble's continuation of Granger, gives all, or the
greater part of the engravings from his portraits, from which it will be
seen, that he was drawn by Kneller, by Richardson, by many others, and
particularly by his friend Jervas.Pope's attachment to him, however, has enshrined
his name in glowing lines to future generations.The portraits of Pope
which Jervas drew, were done _con amore_.Jennings, of Cheapside,
has prefixed to his elegant folio edition of the "Essay on Man," a
_whole-length_ of Mr.In Dodsley's Collection
of Poems, vol.Pope, as an
accompaniment to Mr.Dodsley's affecting poem to his memory, which he
entitles _The Cave of Pope_.Surely this bust must have strongly
resembled Pope, or Mr.The profile
to Ruffhead's Life, in 4to.1769, _must_ have been a likeness, or Bishop
Warburton would not have permitted its insertion.His age was then
twenty-four.It is finely engraved by Ravenet, from Kneller.A copy of this is admirably engraved in Bell's Poets,
richly ornamented.A copy from that by Richardson is prefixed to
Warton's edition.Among the portraits at _Hagley_, is that of Pope, and
his dog Bounce, by Richardson.[76] Lord Chesterfield thus speaks of
Pope:--"His poor, crazy, deformed body, was a mere Pandora's box,
containing all the physical ills that ever afflicted humanity.This,
perhaps, whetted the edge of his satire, and may, in some degree, excuse
it.I will say nothing of his works; they speak sufficiently for
themselves; they will live as long as taste and letters shall remain in
this country, and be more and more admired, as envy and resentment shall
subside.But I will venture this piece of classical blasphemy: which is,
that however he may be supposed to be obliged to Horace, Horace is more
obliged to him."Ruffhead (generally supposed to have had his
information from Dr.Warburton) thus states:--"Mr.Pope was low in
stature, and of a diminutive and misshapen figure, which no one
ridiculed more pleasantly than himself.His constitution was naturally
tender and delicate, and in his temper he was naturally mild and
gentle, yet sometimes betrayed that exquisite sensibility which is the
concomitant of genius.His lively perception and delicate feeling,
irritated by wretched ill health, made him too quickly take fire, but
his good sense and humanity soon rendered him placable.With regard to
the extent of his genius, it was so wide and various, that perhaps it
may not be too much to say, that he excelled in every species of
composition; and, beside his excellence as a poet, he was both an
antiquarian and an architect, and neither in an inferior degree.[77] No
man ever entertained more exalted notions of friendship, or was ever
more sincere, steady, warm, and disinterested, in all his attachments.Every inch of his heart was let out in lodgings for his friends."Lord
Orrery thus speaks of him:--"His prose writings are little less
harmonious than his verse; and his voice, in common conversation, was so
naturally musical, that I remember honest Tom Southern used to call him
the Little Nightingale; his manners were delicate, easy, and engaging;
he treated his friends with a politeness that charmed, and a generosity
that was much to his honour.Every guest was made happy within his
doors; pleasure dwelt under his roof, and elegance presided at his
table."I
will merely select one or two instances.In a letter to _Swift_, he
says, "My house is too large; my gardens furnish too much wood and
provision for _my_ use.They
have intermarried, and are become rather low friends than servants.Would to God you would come over with Lord Orrery, whose care of you in
the voyage I could so certainly depend on; and bring with you your old
housekeeper, and two or three servants.I have room for all, a heart for
all, and (think what you will) a fortune for all."In another letter to
Swift, he says, "I wish you had any motive to see this kingdom.I could
keep you; for I am rich, that is, I have more than I want.I can afford
room for yourself and two servants.I have, indeed, room enough, nothing
but myself at home: the kind and hearty housewife is dead!the agreeable
and instructive neighbour is gone!yet my house is enlarged, and the
gardens extend and flourish, as knowing nothing of the guests they have
lost.I have more fruit trees and kitchen garden than you have any
thought of; nay, I have good melons and pineapples of my own growth."Allen_, he says, "Let me know your day for coming, and
I will have every room in my house as warm for you as the owner always
would be."Mathias, in his Pursuits of Literature, (besides
expatiating with fond delight, in numerous pages, on the genius of
Pope,) thus speaks of him:--"Familiar with the great, intimate with the
polite, graced by the attentions of the fair, admired by the learned, a
favourite with the nation, independent in an acquired opulence, the
honourable product of his genius, and of his industry; the companion of
persons distinguished for their virtue, birth, high fashion, rank, or
wit, and resident in the centre of all public information and
intelligence; every avenue to knowledge, and every mode of observation
were open to his curious, prying, piercing, and unwearied
intellect."[78]

One may with truth further apply to Mr.Pope what was said of Buchanan,
that his mind was stored with all the fire, and all the graces of
ancient literature.Pope's attachment to _gardens_, appears not only
in his letter to Martha Blount, describing Sir W. Raleigh's seat--but in
his own garden at Twickenham, (where, as Mr.Loudon feelingly observes,
_only the soil of which now remains_)--and in his letter to Mr.Blount,
describing his grotto--but it also bursts forth in many passages
throughout his works--and in his celebrated _Guardian_ (No.173), which
attacks, with the keenest wit, "our study to recede from nature," in our
giants made out of yews, and lavender pigs with sage growing in their
bellies.His epistle to Lord Burlington confirms the charms he felt in
studying nature.Mason, in a note to his English Garden, says, "I
had before called Bacon the prophet, and Milton, the herald of true
taste in gardening.The former, because, in developing the constituent
properties of a princely garden, he had largely expatiated upon that
adorned natural wildness which we now deem the essence of the art.The
latter, on account of his having made this natural wildness the leading
idea in his exquisite description of Paradise.I here call Addison,
_Pope_, Kent, &c. the champions of this true taste."Mason has
added an _&c._, may we not add to these respected names, that of honest
old Bridgman?It was the determination of Lord Byron (had his life been
longer spared), to have erected, at his own expence, a monument to
Pope.[79] We can gather even from his rapid and hurried "Letter on the
Rev.W. L. Bowles's Strictures," his attachment to the high name of
Pope:--"If Lucretius had not been spoiled by the Epicurean system, we
should have had a far superior poem to any now in existence.As mere
poetry, it is the first of Latin poems.Pope has not this defect; his moral is as pure as his poetry is
glorious."--"Pope's charities were his own, and they were noble and
extensive, far beyond his fortune's warrant."--"I have loved and
honoured the fame and name of that illustrious and unrivalled man, far
more than my own paltry renown, and the trashy jingle of the crowd of
schools and upstarts, who pretend to rival, or even surpass him.Sooner
than a single leaf should be torn from _his_ laurel, it were better that
all which these men, and that I, as one of their set, have ever
written, should

   Line trunks, clothe spice, or, fluttering in a row,
   Befringe the rails of Bedlam, or Soho.""The most _perfect_ of our poets, and the purest of our moralists."--"He
is the _moral_ poet of all civilization; and, as such, let us hope that
he will one day be the national poet of mankind.He is the only poet
that never shocks; the only poet whose _faultlessness_ has been made his
reproach.Cast your eye over his productions; consider their extent, and
contemplate their variety:--pastoral, passion, mock-heroic, translation,
satire, ethics,--all excellent, and often perfect.If his great charm be
his _melody_, how comes it that foreigners adore him even in their
diluted translations?Mason has also farther recorded the resplendent fame of this
celebrated man; for in his _Musaeus_, a monody to the memory of Pope, he
invokes the shades of Chaucer, Spencer, and Milton, to do homage to his
departing spirit:--

                 ----to cheer thee at this rueful time
   While black death doth on thy heart-strings prey.So may we greet thee with a nobler strain,
   When soon we meet for aye in yon star-sprinkled plain.Milton thus begins _his_ homage:--

   Thrice hail, thou heaven-taught warbler, last and best
   Of all the train!Poet, in whom conjoin'd
   All that to ear, or heart, or head, could yield
   Rapture; harmonious, manly, clear, sublime!Accept this gratulation: may it cheer
   Thy sinking soul; or these corporeal ills
   Ought daunt thee, nor appal.Know, in high heav'n
   Fame blooms eternal on that spirit divine,
   Who builds immortal verse."[81]

Sir E. Brydges, in his "Letters on the Genius of Lord Byron," thus
characterizes the grace and sweetness of his pathetic powers, in his
_Eloisa_:--"When either his passions or imaginations _were_ roused, they
were deep, strong, and splendid.Notwithstanding _Eloisa_ was an
historical subject, his invention of circumstances of detail, his
imagery, the changes and turns of passion, the brilliancy of hues thrown
upon the whole, the eloquence, the tenderness, the fire, the inimitable
grace and felicity of language, were all the fruits of creative genius.This poem stands alone in its kind; never anticipated, and never likely
to be approached hereafter."Young uttered this sublime apostrophe when the death of Pope was first
announced to him:--

   _Thou, who couldst make immortals_, art thou dead?Of his _Essay on Man_, the Nouveau Dict.Portatif thus
speaks:--"Une metaphysique lumineuse, ornee des charmes de la poesie,
une morale touchante, dont les lecons penetrent le coeur et
convainquent l'esprit, des peintures vives, ou l'homme apprend a se
connoitre, pour apprendre a deviner meilleur; tels sont les principaux
caracteres qui distinguent le poeme Anglois.Son imagination est
egalement sage et feconde, elle prodigue les pensees neunes, et donne le
piquant de la nouveante, aux pensees anciennes; il embelloit les
matieres les plus seches, par la coloris d'une elocution noble, facile,
energeque, variee avec un art infini."In the gardens of Stowe is the following inscription to

                       ALEXANDER POPE,
           Who, uniting the correctness of judgment
                    To the fire of genius,
           By the melody and power of his numbers,
        Gave sweetness to sense, and grace to philosophy.He employed the pointed brilliancy of his wit
                    To chastise the vices,
                 And the eloquence of poetry
             To exalt the virtues of human nature;
           And, being without a rival in his own age,
   Imitated and translated with a spirit equal to the originals,
                   The best Poets of antiquity.WILLIAM KENT, whose portrait appears in Mr.Dallaway's rich edition of
the Anecdotes of Painting.Kent, with Bridgman, Pope, and Addison, have
been termed the fathers of landscape gardening.Walpole, after
reviewing the old formal style of our gardens, in language which it is
painful to me thus only to advert to, instead of copying at length, (for
I am fully "aware of the mischiefs which generally ensue in _meddling_
with the productions of genius"); and after stating that when _nature_
was taken into the plan, every step pointed out new beauties, and
inspired new ideas: "at that moment appeared Kent, painter enough to
taste the charms of landscape, bold and opiniative enough to dare and to
dictate, and born with a genius to strike out a great system from the
twilight of imperfect essays.He leaped the fence, and saw that all
nature was a garden.Thus the pencil of his imagination bestowed all the
arts of landscape on the scenes he handled.But of all the beauties he
added to the face of this beautiful country, none surpassed his
management of water.Thus, dealing in none but the colours of nature,
and catching its most favourable features, men saw a new creation
opening before their eyes."And again he calls him "the inventor of an
art that realizes painting, and improves nature: Mahomet imagined an
elysium, but Kent created many."The greatest of all authorities tells
us, that in Esher's peaceful grove, both

   Kent and Nature vied for Pelham's love.Mason, in his English Garden, thus panegyrises his elysian scenes:--

                       ---- Kent, who felt
   The pencil's power; but fix'd by higher hopes
   Of beauty than that pencil knew to paint,
   Work'd with the living lives that _nature_ lent,
   And realized his landscapes.Pope, as well as Kent, would, and Mr.Mason, must
each of them have read with high approbation the following remark of the
late Sir Uvedale Price:--"the noble and varied works of the eminent
painters of every age and every country, and those of their supreme
mistress, Nature, should be the great models of imitation."Whateley paints in glowing language, the genius of Kent, both at
Stowe, and at Claremont.George Mason thus honestly and finely
pleads for him:--"According to my own ideas, all that has since been
done by the most deservedly admired designers, as Southcote, Hamilton,
Lyttleton, Pitt, Shenstone, Morris, for themselves, and by Wright for
others, all that has been written on the subject, even the gardening
didactic poem, and the didactic essay on the picturesque, have proceeded
from Kent.Had Kent never exterminated the bounds of regularity, never
actually traversed the way to freedom of manner, would any of these
celebrated artists have found it of themselves?Theoretic hints from the
highest authorities, had evidently long existed without sufficient
effect.And had not these great masters actually executed what Kent's
example first inspired, them with, the design of executing, would the
subsequent writers on gardening have been enabled to collect materials
for precepts, or stores for their imaginations?Price acknowledges
himself an admirer of the water-scene at Blenheim.Would it ever have
appeared in its present shape, if no Kent had previously abolished the
stiffness of canals!If this original artist had barely rescued the
liquid element from the constraint of right lines and angles, that
service alone would have given him an indubitable claim to the respect
of posterity."Coventry, in his admirable exposure of the
grotesque absurdities in gardening, (being No.15 of the World) thus
speaks of Kent:--"The great Kent at length appeared in behalf of nature,
declared war against the taste in fashion, and laid the axe to the root
of artificial evergreens.Gardens were no longer filled with yews in the
shape of giants, Noah's ark cut in holly, St.George and the Dragon in
box, cypress lovers, laurustine bears, and all that race of root-born
monsters which flourished so long, and looked so tremendous round the
edges of every grass-plat.The great master above mentioned, truly the
disciple of nature, imitated her in the agreeable wildness and beautiful
irregularity of her plans, of which there are some noble examples still
remaining, that abundantly show the power of his creative genius."Dallaway, when treating on architecture, in his Anecdotes of the Arts,
says, "Kent designed the noble hall at Holkham, terminated by a vast
staircase, producing, in the whole, an imposing effect of grandeur not
to be equalled in England."He was a contemporary
therefore of Horace Walpole.He was buried in the vault at Chiswick,
belonging to his friend and patron, Lord Burlington.BRIDGMAN'S portrait was a private plate.It exhibited a kind-hearted,
hale old countenance.As he has the honour of being classed with Mr._Addison_, and with _Pope_, and _Kent_, as one of the champions who
established the picturesque scenery of landscape gardening, (which
_Bacon_, and _Spencer_, and _Milton_, as hath been observed, foresaw)
his portrait must surely be interesting.The engraved portrait which I
saw of him more than fifty years ago, made then a strong impression on
me.I
neither recollect its painter nor engraver; and it is so scarce, that
neither Mr.Smith, of Lisle Street, nor Mr.Evans, of Great Queen
Street, the intelligent collectors and illustrators of Granger, have
been able to obtain it.Perhaps it will be discovered that it was a
private plate, done at the expence of his generous and noble employer,
Lord Cobham.Of this once able and esteemed man, I can procure little
information.of Gardening says, "Lord Cobham seems to have
been occupied in re-modelling the grounds at _Stowe_, about the same
time that Pope was laying out his gardens at Twickenham.His lordship
began these improvements in 1714, _employing Bridgman_, whose plans and
views for altering old Stowe from the most rigid character of the
ancient style to a more open and irregular design, are still in
existence.Kent was employed a few years afterwards, first to paint the
hall, and afterwards in the double capacity of architect and
landscape-gardener; and the finest scenes there are his creation."The
finest views of Stowe gardens were drawn by Rigaud, and published by
_Sarah Bridgman_, in 1739.The fine and magnificent amphitheatre at the
Duke of Newcastle's, at Claremont, was designed, I believe, by Bridgman.When Queen Caroline added nearly three hundred acres from Hyde Park to
the gardens at Kensington, they were laid out by him.He also laid out
the gardens at Shardeloes, near Amersham.Walpole thus mentions
Bridgman, after alluding to the shears having been applied to the lovely
wildness of nature: "Improvements had gone on, till _London_ and _Wise_
had stocked our gardens with giants, animals, monsters, coats of arms,
and mottos, in yew, box and holly.Absurdity could go no farther, and
the tide turned._Bridgman_, the next fashionable designer of gardens,
was far more chaste; and whether from good sense, or that the nation had
been struck and reformed by the admirable paper in the Guardian, No.173, he banished verdant sculpture, and did not even revert to the
square precision of the foregoing age.He enlarged his plans, disdained
to make every division tally to its opposite; and though he still
adhered much to straight walks with high clipped hedges, they were only
his great lines, the rest he diversified by wilderness and with loose
groves of oak, though still within surrounding hedges.I have observed
in the garden at Gubbins, in Hertfordshire, many detached thoughts, that
strongly indicate the dawn of modern taste.As his reformation gained
footing, he ventured farther, and in the royal garden at Richmond, dared
to introduce cultivated fields, and even morsels of a forest appearance,
by the sides of those endless and tiresome walks that stretched out of
one into another without intermission.But this was not till other
innovators had broke loose too from rigid symmetry.But the capital
stroke, the leading step to all that has followed, was (_I believe the
first thought was Bridgman's_) the destruction of walls for boundaries,
and the invention of fosses,--an attempt then deemed so astonishing,
that the common people called them ha!to express their surprise
at finding a sudden and unperceived check to their walk.[83] One of the
first gardens planted in this simple though still formal style, was my
father's at Houghton.Eyre, an imitator of
Bridgman."PHILIP MILLER died at the age of eighty, and was emphatically styled by
foreigners _hortulanorum princeps_.Switzer bears testimony to his
"usual generosity, openness and freedom."Professor Martyn says, "he
accumulated no wealth from his respectable connection with the great, or
from the numerous editions of his works.He was of a disposition too
generous, and too careless of money, to become rich, and in all his
transactions observed more attention to integrity and honest fame, than
to any pecuniary advantages."Miller, by Maillet, prefixed to the "Dictionnaire des Jardiniers, de
Philipe Miller, traduit de l'Anglois," en 8 tom.Pulteney says of him, "He raised himself by his merit from a state
of obscurity to a degree of eminence, but rarely, if ever before,
equalled in the character of a gardener."Loudon (in that "varied
and voluminous mass of knowledge," his Encyclopaedia), thus
remarks:--"Miller, during his long career, had no considerable
competitor, until he approached the end of it, when several writers took
the advantage of his unwearied labours of near half a century, and fixed
themselves upon him, as various marine insects do upon a decaying
shell-fish.I except Hitt and Justice, who are both originals, as is
also Hill, after his fashion, but his gardening is not much founded in
experience."Miller married Ehret, whose fine taste
and botanical accuracy, and whose splendid drawings of plants, are the
finest ornaments of a botanical library.Miller fixed his residence adjoining that part of Chelsea
church-yard where he lies interred.Johnson gives a list of his writings, and of the different editions of
his celebrated Dictionary, which he terms "this great record of our
art."He farther does full justice to him, by associating his name, at
p.151, with that of "the immortal Swede, whose master mind
reduced the confusion and discord of botany to harmony."He calls Miller
"the perfect botanist and horticulturist."[84] The following spirited
tribute to Mr.Miller, appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine for June,
1828:--

   "_Chelsea, June 5._

"MR.URBAN,--In the first volume, page 250, of the second edition of
_Faulkner's History of Chelsea_, just published, which contains a very
copious fund of historical, antiquarian, and biographical information, I
find inserted the monument and epitaph of Philip Miller, who was so
justly styled 'the prince of horticulture' by contemporary botanists,
and whose well-earned fame will last as long as the sciences of botany
and horticulture shall endure.The epitaph of this distinguished man is
correctly given; but the historian appears not to have duly appreciated,
if he was even aware of, the circumstances which induced the Fellows of
the Linnaean and Horticultural Societies of London to erect this grateful
tribute of respectful esteem to him, who in his life-time, had done more
than any individual, ancient or modern, towards enlarging the boundaries
of the science of horticulture, and very extensively the far more
difficult one of botany likewise.These he accomplished in the numerous
editions of his unrivalled Dictionary, and in his elaborate
introductions to botanical knowledge."The reasons which induced the above-mentioned societies to erect the
monument in question, were, chiefly, because neither monument, nor tomb,
nor even any recording public notice whatever (the'monumentum aere
perennius' of his own immortal works excepted) had previously been
provided by any one."The relatives of Miller were very few; he had no family, save two sons,
one of whom died early, and the other, Charles Miller, at the age of 78,
who spent the greater part of his long life in India, and returned not
until after his father's funeral; and over his grave, in the old
church-yard of Chelsea, a stone and sculptured brass record his name and
age and parentage, together with that of his aged and more distinguished
sire.This stone, too, was placed by the above-mentioned public-spirited
societies, (unto both which the writer has the honour to belong) at the
same time as the monument, stated by Faulkner, to the never-dying fame
of the father."But it is even now scarcely known, that when those meritorious
testimonials of public gratitude were showered over the memory of Philip
Miller, who had laboured so long and so successfully in the sciences
which he loved, there was only one individual in existence, and that a
very aged person, who had seen and attended the funeral of Miller, and
who alone could point out the very spot where the 'Prince of
Horticulture' was inhumed.This venerable person's name was Goodyer; he
was the parish clerk of Chelsea church for half a century, and died as
such in 1818, at the great age of ninety-four."Nevertheless, though last, it should not be concealed that I myself had
actually stated and published, in the winter of 1794-5, the neglectful
and opprobrious fact of Miller's having no single grave-stone, much less
a monument, nor even one funeral line, to designate the spot where
rested in its 'narrow house' the mortal relics of so great a man; see my
Observations on the Genus Mesembryanthemum, p.311-14; and, as every
reader may not possess that publication, the following extract from it
is added:--

"'So much for Miller; he, alas!who pleased so well, or, rather let me
say, he who instructed and edified so much, and was even caressed by the
great while living, now lies, forgotten by his friends, inhumed amongst
the common undistinguished dead, in the bleak cold yard of Chelsea
church, the very theatre of his best actions, the physic gardens of the
Worshipful Company of Apothecaries, at Chelsea, not half a mile distant,
without a tomb!nay, destitute of a single line to mark
the spot where rests, retired from all its cares and useful toils, the
time-worn frame of the 'Prince of Horticulture!'How are those
discerning foreigners, who so meritoriously rendered the language of his
Dictionary into their own, to judge of this?by what measure are they to
estimate the fact?Miller was the author of several publications,
besides the very numerous editions of his Dictionary and Kalendar.'His works are many of them enumerated in the Encyclo.The most full list is in Weston's Catalogue.His portrait is
engraved in metz by Houston, from after Coates.It is an oval, with a
_solitaire_.A short account of his life and writings was published at
Edinburgh in 1779.The most general account of him is in Hutchinson's
Biog.BATTY LANGLEY was born at Twickenham, where he resided.He was the
author of,

1.New Principles of Gardening, or the laying out and planting
parterres, groves, wildernesses, labyrinths, avenues, parks, &c. cuts,
1728, 4to.The sure Method of Improving Estates by Trees, 8vo.One of his
chapters is "On the magnitude and prodigious Growth of Trees."Pomona, or the Fruit Gardener, _with plates_, fol.At the end
is a letter to Mr.Langley, on Cyder, from Hugh Stafford, Esq.Langley, with the name of
Carwirtham, as the engraver or print-seller, 1741.SIR WILLIAM WATSON, an eminent physician, who died in 1787, wrote

1.Account of the Remains of Tradescant's Garden.Account of the Bishop of London's Garden, at Fulham.besides many valuable papers in several volumes of
these Transactions.He had the pleasure of introducing _Kalm_, as well as _Pallas_, to most
of the curious gardens in the environs of London.On the first
establishment of the British Museum, he was most active in furnishing
its garden, with no fewer than six hundred plants.Pulteney observes) "became the resort of the most ingenious and
illustrious experimental philosophers that England could boast."Pulteney has closed a very liberal memoir of him, by inserting Dr.Garthshore's testimony to the humane feeling, the social politeness, and
benignity of Sir William.His portrait is painted by Abbot, and engraved
by Ryder, 1791.There is a full account of him in Chalmers.WILLIAM HANBURY, the intimate friend of Churchill, and of
Lloyd, in his singular "History of the Charitable Foundations at Church
Langton," (and which exhibits his own benevolent heart, and great love
for planting and gardening) mentions, at page 185, a full-length
portrait of himself, by Penny.Had there been any other portrait of him,
it is likely Mr.Nicholls would have mentioned it in his Leicestershire,
for that gentleman, as well as Joseph Cradock, Esq.(both of whom are
lately deceased), would have been most likely to have known, if any
other portrait of this zealous planter did exist; so would Dr.Thomas
Warton, who always spoke of Mr.Hanbury as a generous, disinterested,
and benevolent man.Earlom engraved, in 1775, a three-quarter
metzotinto, from the above portrait by Penny.Hanbury also published
"A Complete Body of Planting and Gardening;" 2 vols.Also, "An
Essay on Planting, and a Scheme to make it conducive to the Glory of
God, and the Advantage of Society;" Oxford, 8vo.And "The
Gardener's New Calendar;" 8vo.Hanbury first conceived, in 1751, the establishing at Church
Langton, for benevolent purposes, his immense plantations; having
procured (particularly from North America) "almost every sort of seed
that could be procured."He proposed that an annual sermon should be
preached, either in praise of church music, the duty of decorating
religious houses, charity in general, or the wonders of the creation;
and that a hospital should be founded for the relief of the really
distressed.Even when his
first twenty thousand trees had just been planted out, the cattle
belonging to the tenants of Mrs.Dorothy Pickering, and Frances Byrd,
(who a few years after died worth two hundred thousand pounds, and whose
village biography is curiously dispersed throughout the above history)
were _purposely_ turned amongst the young trees, and in a little time
destroyed them all."Neither was this all; I was served for a trespass
with twenty-seven different copies of writs in one day (by their
attorney, Valentine Price, of Leicester); to such a degree of rage and
fury were these old gentlewomen raised, at what one should have thought
every heart would have rejoiced, and kindly lent an assisting hand."Hanbury gives many instances of the "venomous rage and passion" of these
two old women.They had, says he, "the mortification to find themselves
totally despised.Not a gentleman or lady would go near them, two
neighbouring clergymen excepted, who were invited to dine with them upon
venison."They attempted making a tool of the sow-gelder's son, to
enable them to carry on their mean plans, and sent him word, that
nothing they could do for him in the parish should be wanting.His
answer was, "that favours granted from such people, on such terms, could
never prosper, and he desired the other to tell them, they were _two old
bitches_."--"This summer, (says Mr.Hanbury,) was murdered, in the most
barbarous manner, the best spaniel that perhaps ever entered the field,
and the best greyhound that ever run.With these I had been often
entertained in my morning walks.To deprive me of these pleasures,
afforded me in my morning recreations, I had discharges from Mrs.Byrd, for taking them with me in their manors.To
these I paid no regard, and as they never brought any action on that
account, it may be supposed they could find no just cause to ground one.Some method is to be contrived to deprive me of
my attendants; the spaniel therefore was the first object destined for
destruction.He was small, and of a beautiful black, and had been used
to the parlour; and being absent about an hour, came reeling home in the
agonies of death; and in about a quarter of an hour after, died in the
seemingly most excruciating tortures.Suspecting some villany, I ordered
him to be opened, but found everything perfect and entire; I then
directed him to be skinned, and coming to the loins, found the traces of
a table-fork, which was stuck into the kidneys, and which was the
occasion of his speedy and dreadful death.A few days after this, my
best greyhound was stuck in the loins, in the like barbarous manner,
which brought on the same kind of speedy and agonizing death; and this
was the catastrophe of these two noted dogs, which had been much talked
of, and were famous amongst sportsmen, as being most perfect in their
kind.Some time after this, their game-keeper, in company with his
nephew, _buried two dogs alive_; they were the property of Mr.Wade, a
substantial grazier, who had grounds contiguous to a place of cover,
called Langton Caudle, where was often game; and where the unfortunate
two dogs, straying from their master, had been used to hunt.The
game-keeper and his nephew being shooting in this place, the dogs, upon
the report of the gun, made towards them.Their shooting them or hanging
them would have been merciful, but they buried them alive; and what
words can express the abhorrence of such barbarity to such innocent
creatures following the dictates of nature?To prevent a possibility of
their scratching a way out, they covered them down with black thorns;
over these they laid a sufficient quantity of earth and one large stone,
which the rammed down with their heels.Day after day the dogs were
heard in this place, with the howling, barking noise of dogs that were
lost.Some people resorted to find them out, and wondered it was to no
purpose, for nobody could suspect the dogs were under ground; and thus
after calling and whistling them, and seeking them for some time,
returned, amazed that lost dogs should continue so long in that place;
but a sight of none could ever be had.The noise was fancied to come
sometimes from one quarter, sometimes from another; and when they came
near the place they were in, they ceased howling, expecting their
deliverance was at hand.I myself heard them _ten days_ after they had
been buried; and seeing some people at a distance, enquired what dogs
they were._They are some dogs that are lost, Sir_, said they; _they
have been lost some time_.I concluded only some poachers had been there
early in the morning, and by a precipitate flight had left their dogs
behind them.In short, the howling and barking of these dogs was heard
for near three weeks, when it ceased.Wade's dogs were missing, but
he could not suspect those to be his; and the noise ceasing, the
thoughts, wonder, and talking about them, soon also ceased.Some time
after, a person being amongst the bushes where the howling was heard,
discovered some disturbed earth, and the print of men's heels ramming it
down again very close; and seeing Mr.Wade's servant, told him, he
thought something had been buried there._Then_, said the man, _it is
our dogs, and they have been buried alive: I will go and fetch a spade,
and will find them, if I dig all Caudle over_.He soon brought a spade,
and upon removing the top earth, came to the blackthorns, and then to
the dogs, the biggest of which had eat the loins and greatest share of
the hind parts of the little one."Hanbury states the deaths of
these two sisters in the course of a few months after.The sums they
accumulated by their penurious way of living, were immense.They
bequeathed legacies by will to almost every body that were no kin to
them except their assiduous attorney, Valentine Price, to whom they left
nothing."But what is strange and wonderful, though their charities in
their life-time at Langton were a sixpenny loaf a week only, which was
divided into as many parts as there were petitioners, and distributed by
eleven of the clock on a Sunday, unless they left the town the day
before, which was often the case, and when the poor were sure to fail of
their bounty; these gentlewomen, at the death of the last, bequeathed by
will upwards of twelve thousand pounds to the different hospitals and
religious institutions in the kingdom.A blaze of goodness issued from
them at last, and thus ended these two poor, unhappy, uncharitable,
charitable old gentlewomen."Marshall calls him, "the indefatigable Hanbury, whose immense
labours are in a manner lost to the public."Hanbury did, in describing the beauty of trees and shrubs: this is
visible in the extracts which Mr.Marshall has made in his "Planting and
Rural Ornament."WILLIAM SHENSTONE, Esq., justly celebrated for his pure and classic
taste in landscape gardening.His tender and pathetic feelings shine
throughout most of his works; and the sweetness and simplicity of his
temper and manners, endeared him to the neighbourhood and to his
acquaintance.Johnson says, his life was unstained by any crime.He
farther says of him, "He began from this time to entangle his walks, and
to wind his waters; which he did with such judgment and such fancy, as
made his little domain the envy of the great and the admiration of the
skilful.His house was mean, and he did not improve it; his care was of
his grounds.When he came home from his walks, he might find his floor
flooded by a shower through the broken roof; but could spare no money
for its reparation.In time his expences brought clamours about him,
that overpowered the lamb's bleat and the linnet's song; and his groves
were haunted by beings very different from fawns and fairies.He spent
his estate in adorning it, and his death was probably hastened by his
anxieties.He was a lamp that spent its oil in blazing.It is said, that
if he had lived a little longer he would have been assisted by a
pension: such bounty could not have been ever more properly bestowed;
but that it was ever asked is not certain; it is too certain that it
never was enjoyed."His intimate friend, Robert Dodsley, thus speaks of him: "Tenderness,
indeed, in every sense of the word, was his peculiar characteristic; his
friends, his domestics, his poor neighbours, all daily experienced his
benevolent turn of mind.He was no economist; the generosity of his
temper prevented him from paying a proper regard to the use of money: he
exceeded, therefore, the bounds of his paternal fortune, which before he
died was considerably incumbered.But when one recollects the perfect
paradise he had raised around him, the hospitality with which he lived,
his great indulgence to his servants, his charities to the indigent, and
all done with an estate not more than three hundred pounds a year, one
should rather be led to wonder that he left any thing behind him, than
to blame his want of economy.He left, however, more than sufficient to
pay all his debts; and, by his will, appropriated his whole estate for
that purpose."His portrait is prefixed to his works, published in 3 vols.His second volume contains his "Unconnected Thoughts on Landscape
Gardening;" and the description of the celebrated _Leasowes_, in that
volume, was written by ("the modest, sensible, and humane") Robert
Dodsley.His Epistolary Correspondence appeared in 2 vols.The
title pages of the above first three volumes are attractive from their
vignette, or rural embellishments.A portrait of Shenstone was taken in
1758, by Ross, which Hall engraved for Dodsley, in 1780; and this
picture by Ross was in the possession of the late most worthy Dr.Graves, of Claverton, who died a few years ago, at the advanced age of
ninety.Bell's edition of the Poets has a neat copy of this portrait.Graves wrote "Recollections of the late William Shenstone."He also
dedicated an urn to him, and inscribed these lines thereon:--

   Stranger!if woods and lawns like these,
   If rural scenes thy fancy please,
   Ah!stop awhile, and pensive view
   Poor Shenstone's urn: who oft, like you,
   These woods and lawns well-pleased has rov'd,
   And oft these rural scenes approv'd.Like him, be thou fair virtue's friend,
   And health and peace thy steps attend.Shenstone died in 1763, and is buried in Hales Owen church yard.An
urn is placed in the church to his memory, thus inscribed:--

   Whoe'er thou art, with reverence tread
   These sacred mansions of the dead.--
   Not that the monumental bust
   Or sumptuous tomb HERE guards the dust
   Of rich or great: (Let wealth, rank, birth,
   Sleep undistinguish'd in the earth;)
   This simple urn records a name
   That shines with more exalted fame.if genius, taste refined,
   A native elegance of mind;
   If virtue, science, manly sense;
   If wit, that never gave offence;
   The clearest head, the tenderest heart,
   In thy esteem e'er claim'd a part;
   Ah!smite thy breast, and drop a tear,
   For, know, THY Shenstone's dust lies here.Mason thus speaks of Shenstone:

                          ----"Nor thou
   Shalt pass without thy meed, thou son of peace,
   Who knew'st perchance to harmonize thy shades
   Still softer than thy song; yet was that song
   Nor rude nor unharmonious, when attuned
   To pastoral plaint, or tales of slighted love."Whateley pays his memory the following tribute, previous to his
masterly survey of his far-famed and enchanting seat: "An allusion to
the ideas of pastoral poetry evidently enters into the design of the
Leasowes, where they appear so lovely as to endear the memory of their
author, and justify the reputation of Mr.Shenstone, who inhabited, made
and directed that celebrated place.It is a perfect picture of his mind,
simple, elegant, and amiable, and will always suggest a doubt whether
the spot inspired his verses, or whether, in the scenes which he formed,
he only realized the pastoral images which abound in his songs."[85]
George Mason, in many pages, pays high compliments to Shenstone's taste:
"Paine's Hill has every mark of creative genius, and Hagley of
correctest fancy; but the most intimate _alliance with nature_ was
formed by Shenstone."Marshall, in his "Planting and Rural
Ornament," has some critical remarks on the _Leasowes_, the expences in
perfecting which threw Shenstone "on the rack of poverty, and probably
hastened the dissolution of an amiable and valuable man."He says that
_Enville_ was originally designed by Shenstone, and that the cascade
and chapel were spoken of, with confidence, as his.[86]


LORD KAMES.His portrait is prefixed to the memoirs of him, by Lord
Woodhouselee, in 2 vols.There is an edition of the same
work, in 3 vols.1814, with the same portrait, which is engraved
from a drawing by D. Martin.His "Gentleman Farmer" spread his fame
through Scotland.Smellie,
in his Literary Lives of Gregory, Home, Hume, Adam Smith, and Lord
Kames, after giving many interesting particulars of the latter, and
after noticing his benevolence to the poor, during the whole course of
his long life, proceeds:--"One great feature in the character of Lord
Kames, besides his literary talents, and his public spirit, was a
remarkable innocency of mind.He not only never indulged in detraction,
but when any species of scandal was exhibited in his company, he either
remained silent, or endeavoured to give a turn to the conversation.As
natural consequences of this amiable disposition, he never meddled with
politics, even when politics ran to indecent lengths in this country;
and what is still more remarkable, he never wrote a sentence,
notwithstanding his numerous publications, without a direct and a
manifest intention to benefit his fellow creatures.In his temper he was
naturally warm, though kindly and affectionate.In the friendships he
formed, he was ardent, zealous and sincere.So far from being inclined
to irreligion, as some ignorant bigots insinuated, few men possessed a
more devout habit of thought.A constant sense of Deity, and a
veneration for Providence, dwelt upon his mind.From this source arose
that propensity, which appears in all his writings, of investigating
final causes, and tracing the wisdom of the Supreme Author of Nature."He had the honour to be highly esteemed by the celebrated Mrs.1790, which gives an engraved portrait of
him, being a copy of the above, thus speaks: "He was one of the very
first who to great legal knowledge, added a considerable share of polite
literature.He arrived at the highest rank to which a lawyer could
attain in his own country; and he has left to the world such literary
productions, as will authorize his friends to place him, if not in the
highest, yet much above the lowest, class of elegant and polite writers.He died in 1783, leaving to the world a proof, that an attention to the
abstrusest branches of learning, is not incompatible with the more
pleasing pursuits of taste and polite literature."His pure taste in landscape scenery, is acknowledged by Mr.81 of the Encyclopaedia of Gardening._Blair Drummond_ will
long be celebrated as having been his residence, and he there displayed
his superior taste in planting and improving.In his "Elements of Criticism," (a truly original work) there is a
distinct chapter on architecture and gardening.He therein thus
addresses the reader:--"These cursory observations upon gardening, shall
be closed with some reflections that must touch every reader.Rough
uncultivated ground, dismal to the eye, inspires peevishness and
discontent: may not this be one cause of the harsh manners of savages?A
field richly ornamented, containing beautiful objects of various kinds,
displays in full lustre the goodness of the Deity, and the ample
provision he has made for our happiness.Ought not the spectator to be
filled with gratitude to his Maker, and with benevolence to his fellow
creatures?Other fine arts may be perverted to excite irregular and even
vicious emotions; but gardening, which inspires the purest and most
refined pleasures, cannot fail to promote every good affection.The
gaiety and harmony of mind it produceth, inclineth the spectator to
communicate his satisfaction to others, and to make them happy as he is
himself, and tends naturally to establish in him a habit of humanity and
benevolence."JOHN ABERCROMBIE'S manly and expressive countenance is best given in the
portrait prefixed to an edition in 2 vols.1, 1783,
by Fielding and Debrett.He is also drawn at full-length at his age of
seventy-two, in the sixteenth edition, printed in 1800, with a pleasing
view of a garden in the back-ground, neatly engraved.This honest,
unassuming man, persevered "through a long life of scarcely interrupted
health," in the ardent pursuit of his favourite science.The tenor of
his life exemplified how much a garden calms the mind, and tranquilly
sets at rest its turbulent passions.of
Gardening, after giving some interesting points of his history, thus
concludes: "In the spring of 1806, being in his eightieth year, he met
with a severe fall, by which he broke the upper part of his thigh bone.This accident, which happened to him on the 15th of April, terminated in
his death.After lying in a very weak exhausted state, without much
pain, he expired in the night, between April and May, as St.He was lamented by all who knew him, as cheerful,
harmless, and upright."One of his biographers thus relates of him:
"Abercrombie from a fall down stairs in the dark, died at the age of
eighty, and was buried at St.He was present at the famous
battle of Preston Pans, which was fought close to his father's garden
walls.For the last twenty years of his life he lived chiefly on tea,
using it three times a-day: his pipe was his first companion in the
morning, and last at night.[87] He never remembered to have taken a dose
of physic in his life, prior to his last fatal accident, nor of having a
day's illness but once."A list of his works appears in Watts's Bibl.Brit., and a most full one in Johnson's History of English Gardening,
who, with many collected particulars of Abercrombie, relates the great
and continually increasing sale of some of his works.LAUNCELOT BROWNE, Esq.His portrait was painted by Dance, and engraved by Sherwin.Under this
portrait are engraved the following lines, from the pen of Mr.Mason,
which are also inscribed on the tomb of Mr.Browne, in the church of
Fen-Staunton, Huntingdonshire:

   _Ye sons of elegance, who truly taste
     The simple charms which genuine art supplies,
   Come from the sylvan scenes his genius drew,
     And offer here your tributary sighs.But know, that more than genius slumbers here,
     Virtues were his that art's best powers transcend,
   Come, ye superior train!who these revere,
     And weep the christian, husband, father, friend._

Mr.Browne this elegant compliment: "Did living
artists come within my plan, I should be glad to do justice to Mr.Browne; but he may be a gainer by being reserved for some abler pen."This celebrated landscape gardener died suddenly, in Hertford Street,
May Fair, on the 6th of February, 1783, on his return from a visit to
his old friend the Earl of Coventry.Browne, though bred a common
gardener at Stowe, possessed a cultivated mind, and his society was much
courted.called him "a most agreeable, unassuming
man."He was consulted by most of the
nobility and gentry, and the places he laid out or altered, were, as Mr.Repton has given a list of
his principal works.It has been the fate of this eminent master of landscape embellishment,
to be severely censured by some, and lavishly praised by others.The
late keen and consummate observer of landscape scenery, Sir Uvedale
Price, harshly condemns the too frequent cold monotony and tameness of
many of Mr.Browne's creations, and his never transfusing into his works
any thing of the taste and spirit which prevail in the poet Mason's
precepts and descriptions; and in one of his acute, yet pleasant pages,
he alludes to his having but _one_ and the same plan of operation;
_Sangrado_-like, treating all disorders in the same manner.Perhaps the
too general smoothness and tameness of Mr.Browne's pleasure-grounds ill
accorded with Sir Uvedale's enthusiasm for the more sublime views of
forest scenery, rapid and stony torrents and cascades, wild entangled
dingles, and craggy breaks; or with the high and sublime notions he had
imbibed from the rich scenery of nature so often contemplated by him in
the landscapes of _Claude_, or in those of _Rubens_, _Gaspar Poussin_,
_Salvator Rosa_, or of _Titian_, "the greatest of all landscape
painters."Perhaps Sir Uvedale preferred "unwedgeable and gnarled oaks,"
to "the tameness of the poor pinioned trees of a gentleman's plantation,
drawn up straight," or the wooded banks of a river, to the "bare shaven
border of a canal."[88]

Daines Barrington happily said, "Kent has been succeeded by Browne, who
hath undoubtedly great merit in laying out pleasure-grounds; but I
conceive that in some of his plans, I see rather traces of the
kitchen-gardener of old Stowe, than of Poussin or Claude Lorraine: I
could wish, therefore, that Gainsborough gave the design, and that
Browne executed it.Loudon observes, "that Browne must have
possessed considerable talents, the extent of his reputation abundantly
proves; but that he was imbued with much of that taste for picturesque
beauty, which distinguished the works of Kent, Hamilton, and Shenstone,
we think will hardly be asserted by any one who has observed attentively
such places as are known to be his creations."George Mason candidly
asks, "why Browne should be charged with all the defects of those that
have called themselves his followers, I have seen no good reason
alleged, nor can I suppose it possible to produce one."Many of his
imitators exhibited so little talent in their creations, that Mr.Browne's name considerably suffered in the estimation of many.Gilpin speaks of Browne's improvements at Blenheim in high terms.Marshall in his Survey of Stowe and Fisherwick, in vol.i. of his
"Planting and Rural Ornament," and at p.384, pays a fair tribute to
him.Much general information respecting him may be seen in Mr.Loudon's
chapter "Of the rise, progress, and present state of gardening in the
British Isles."The candour and rich conciseness of this review,
embraces the whole _magic of the art_, as respects landscape
gardening.[90]


FRANCIS ZAVIER VISPRE wrote "A Dissertation on the Growth of Wine in
England", Bath, 8vo.Vispre died poor, between thirty and
forty years ago, in St.He excelled in painting portraits
in crayons: Sir Joshua much esteemed him.He was a most inoffensive man,
of the mildest manners, and of the purest integrity.I have seen his
portrait in crayons, in an oval, finely finished by himself, but know
not now where that is.On his mode of training the vine _very near the
ground_, see p.WILLIAM MASON, precentor and canon of York, died in 1797.His friend,
Sir Joshua Reynolds, painted an impressive portrait of him, which is
engraved by Doughty.A masterly copy of this fine portrait is in Mr.A copy is also prefixed to the edition
of his works, in 4 vols.His
portrait was also taken by Vaslet, and engraved by Carter, 1771.It is a
large metz etching.He translated Du Fresnoy's Art of Painting, to which
Sir Joshua added some notes.Mason has prefixed an Epistle to Sir
Joshua, which thus concludes:

   And oh!if ought thy poet can pretend
   Beyond his favourite wish, to _call thee friend_:
   Be it that here his tuneful toil has dress'd
   The muse of _Fresnoy_ in a modern vest;
   And, with what skill his fancy could bestow,
   Taught the close folds to take an easier flow;
   Be it that here, thy partial smile approv'd
   The pains he lavish'd on the art he lov'd.Mason's attachment to painting was an early one, is conspicuous in
many of his writings, and in his English Garden, is visible throughout:

                                ----feel ye there
   What _Reynolds_ felt, when first the Vatican
   Unbarr'd her gates, and to his raptur'd eye
   Gave all the god-like energy that flow'd
   From _Michael's_ pencil; feel what _Garrick_ felt,
   When first he breath'd the soul of _Shakspeare's_ page.Sir Joshua, in his will, bequeaths his then supposed portrait of Milton
to Mr.Gray thus observes of Mason, when at Cambridge:--"So ignorant of the
world and its ways, that this does not hurt him in one's opinion; so
sincere and so undisguised, that no mind with a spark of generosity
would ever think of hurting him, he lies so open to injury; but so
indolent, that if he cannot overcome this habit, all his good qualities
will signify nothing at all."Mason, in 1754, found a patron in the Earl of Holderness, who
presented him with the living of _Aston_, in Yorkshire.This sequestred
village was favourable to his love of poetry and picturesque scenery;
which displayed itself at large in his English Garden, and was the
foundation of his lasting friendship with Mr.Gilpin, who to testify his
esteem, dedicated to him his _Observations on the Wye_.Shore, of Norton Hall, (the friend of Priestley), thus
mentions _Aston_:--"That truly conscientious, and truly learned and
excellent man, Mr.Lindsey, spent a whole week in this neighbourhood.He
was during that time the guest of his friend Mr.Mason, who was residing
on his rectory at _Aston_, the biographer of Gray, and one whose taste,
gave beauty, and poetry, celebrity, to that cheerful village."Gray, terminated only with the life of the latter.Mason was visited at Aston, for the last time, by him.Mason was from Pembroke-hall, in May, 1771, and on the
31st of the next month, and at that place, this sublime genius paid the
debt of nature.Mason, and
inscribed on the monument in Westminster Abbey:

   No more the Grecian muse unrivall'd reigns;
     To Britain let the nations homage pay:
   She felt a Homer's fire in Milton's strains,
     A Pindar's rapture in the lyre of Gray.He farther evinced his attachment to this elegant scholar by publishing
his poems and letters, to which he prefixed memoirs of him.He commences
the third book of his English Garden with an invocation to his memory,
and records, in lofty language, his eye glistening and his accents
glowing, when viewing the charms of all-majestic Nature--the heights of
Skiddaw and the purple crags of Borrowdale.And on a rustic alcove, in
the garden at Aston, which he dedicated to Mr.Gray, he inscribed this
stanza from the celebrated elegy:

   _Here scatter'd oft, the loveliest of the year,
     By hands unseen, are showers of violets found;
   The red-breast loves to build and warble here,
     And little footsteps lightly print the ground._

Mr.Mason married in 1765 a most amiable woman; she fell at length into
a rapid consumption, and at Bristol hot-wells she died.Mason while at that place, is full of eloquence; upon which the
latter observes, "I opened it almost at the precise moment when it would
be necessarily most affecting.His epitaph on the monument he erected on
this lady, in the Bristol cathedral, breathes such tender feeling and
chaste simplicity, that it can need no apology for being noticed here:

   Take, holy earth!all that my soul holds dear;
     Take that best gift which heav'n so lately gave:
   To Bristol's fount I bore with trembling care
     Her faded form: she bow'd to taste the wave
   And died.Does youth, does beauty, read the line?breathe a strain divine:
     E'en from the grave thou shalt have power to charm.Bid them be chaste, be innocent, like thee;
     Bid them in duty's sphere as meekly move;
   And if so fair, from vanity as free;
     As firm in friendship, and as fond in love.Tell them, though 'tis an awful thing to die,
     ('Twas e'en to thee) yet the dread path once trod,
   Heav'n lifts its everlasting portals high,
     And bids "the pure in heart behold their God."Mason's death, he began his English
Garden, and invokes the genius both of poetry and painting

                         ----that at my birth
   Auspicious smil'd, and o'er my cradle dropp'd
   Those magic seeds of Fancy, which produce
   A Poet's feeling, and a Painter's eye.----with lenient smiles to deign to cheer,
   At this sad hour, my desolated soul.For deem not ye that I resume the lyre
   To court the world's applause; my years mature
   Have learn'd to slight the toy.No, 'tis to soothe
   That agony of heart, which they alone,
   Who best have lov'd, who best have been belov'd,
   Can feel, or pity: sympathy severe!Which she too felt, when on her pallid lip
   The last farewell hung trembling, and bespoke
   A wish to linger here, and bless the arms
   She left for heav'n.--She died, and heav'n is her's!Be mine, the pensive solitary balm
   That recollection yields.While memory holds her seat, thine image still
   Shall reign, shall triumph there; and when, as now,
   Imagination forms a nymph divine,
   To lead the fluent strain, thy modest blush,
   Thy mild demeanour, thy unpractis'd smile,
   Shall grace that nymph, and sweet Simplicity
   Be dress'd (ah, meek Maria!)Thomas Warton thus speaks of the above poem, when reviewing Tusser's
Husbandry:--"Such were the rude beginnings in the English language of
didactic poetry, which, on a kindred subject, the present age has seen
brought to perfection, by the happy combination of judicious precepts,
with the most elegant ornaments of language and imagery, in Mr.His Elfrida and Caractacus, are admired for boldness of
conception and sublime description.Elfrida was set to Music by Arne,
and again by Giardini.Mason's
success with both these dramatic poems was beyond his most sanguine
expectation.Mason; these lines are its concluding
part:

   Weave the bright wreath, to worth departed just,
   And hang unfading chaplets on his bust;
   While pale Elfrida, bending o'er his bier,
   Breathes the soft sigh and sheds the graceful tear;
   And stern Caractacus, with brow depress'd
   Clasps the cold marble to his mailed breast.In lucid troops shall choral virgins throng,
   With voice alternate chant their poet's song.in golden characters record
   Each firm, immutable, immortal word!"Those last two lines from the final chorus of Elfrida, (says Miss
Seward), admirably close this tribute to the memory of him who stands
second to Gray, as a lyric poet; whose English Garden is one of the
happiest efforts of didactic verse, containing the purest elements of
horticultural taste, dignified by freedom and virtue, rendered
interesting by episode, and given in those energetic and undulating
measures which render blank verse excellent; whose unowned satires, yet
certainly his, the heroic epistle to Sir William Chambers, and its
postscript, are at once original in their style, harmonious in their
numbers, and pointed in their ridicule; whose tragedies are the only
pathetic tragedies which have been written in our language upon the
severe Greek model.The Samson Agonistes bears marks of a stronger, but
also of an heavier hand, and is unquestionably less touching than the
sweet Elfrida, and the sublime Caractacus."Mason, in 1756 published four Odes."It would be difficult to say,
(says the biographer of the annual Necrology of 1797,) which is most to
be admired, the vividness of the conception, or the spirit of liberty,
and the ardent love of independance throughout.The address to Milton in
his Ode to Memory, and to Andrew Marvel, in that to Independance, cannot
be too much admired.At the period when the Middlesex election was so
much agitated, he united with those independant freeholders, who, by
their declarations and petitions, throughout the nation, opposed
corruption, and claimed a reform in parliament; and when the county of
York assembled in 1779, he was of the committee, and had a great share
in drawing up their spirited resolutions.The animated vindication of
the conduct of the freeholders, and other papers, though printed
anonimously in the newspapers, and so printed in Mr.Wyvill's collection
of political tracts, in 3 vols.This conduct rendered him obnoxious to the court party.He
was at this time one of the king's chaplains, but when it became his
turn to preach before the royal family, the queen appointed another
person to supply his place.It has been observed, that his sentiments in
a later period of his life, took a colour less favourable to liberty.Whether alarmed at the march of the French revolution, or from the
timidity of age, we know not.His friend Horace Walpole, charges him
with flat apostacy:" The _Heroic Epistle_ to Sir W. Chambers, and the
_Heroic Postscript_, are now positively said to have been written by Mr.Thomas Warton observed, "they may have been written by
Walpole, and buckramed by Mason."The late Sir U. Price, in the generous and patriotic conclusion of his
letter to Mr.Repton, pays a delicate compliment to the genius of Mr.Mason in whatever concerns rural scenery; and his respect for Mr.Mason,
and his high opinion of his talents, is farther shewn in pp.295 and
371 of his first volume, and in p.Mason to have been the author of the Heroic Epistle, and
after paying a high compliment to his general poetry, thus concludes his
generous tribute:

   Whence is that groan?no more Britannia sleeps,
   But o'er her lov'd Musaeus bends and weeps.Lo, every Grecian, every British muse
   Scatter the recent flowers and gracious dews
   Where MASON lies!And in his breast each soft affection dwelt,
   That love and friendship know; each sister art,
   With all that colours, and that sounds impart,
   All that the sylvan theatre can grace,
   All in the soul of MASON found their place!Low sinks the laurell'd head: in Mona's land
   I see them pass, 'tis Mador's drooping band,
   To harps of woe, in holiest obsequies,
   In yonder grave, they chant, our Druid lies!In the life of this justly celebrated physician, by Miss
Seward, she informs us, that in the year 1770, he sat to Mr.Wright of
Derby; and that it was "a contemplative portrait, of the most perfect
resemblance."He was then in
his thirty-eighth year.Thornton, in his superb work on botany, has
given a fine portrait of Dr.Darwin, at a more advanced period of his
life.It breathes intelligence in every feature, and is a masterly
likeness.Archdeacon Clive preserved a highly-finished
miniature portrait of him, which was ordered by Dr.Darwin for the
express purpose of being presented to this worthy clergyman, whom he so
much esteemed.Zoonomia, or the Laws of Organic Life.Phytologia, or the Philosophy of Agriculture and Gardening, 4to."A vast field of treasured observation and scientific literature."Lord Byron, and others, have been severe on this poem.The lines,
however, on the soldier's wife and infants, after watching the battle of
Minden--those animated ones to Mr.Howard--or when the mother, during
the plague in London, commits her children to the grave,

   _When o'er the friendless bier no rites were read,
   No dirge slow chanted, and no pall outspread;_

these make one gladly acknowledge, that pathetic powers were the gift of
Darwin's muse.The sublimity of the following address to our _first_
daring aeronaut, merits insertion:

   --Rise, great Mongolfier!urge thy venturous flight
   High o'er the moon's pale, ice-reflected light;
   High o'er the pearly star, whose beamy horn
   Hangs in the east, gay harbinger of morn;
   Leave the red eye of Mars on rapid wing,
   Jove's silver guards, and Saturn's dusky ring;
   Leave the fair beams, which issuing from afar
   Play with new lustres round the Georgian star;
   Shun with strong oars the sun's attractive throne,
   The burning Zodiac, and the milky Zone:
   Where headlong comets with increasing force
   Through other systems bend their burning course!For thee Cassiope her chair withdraws,
   For thee the Bear retracts his shaggy paws;
   High o'er the north thy golden orb shall roll,
   And blaze eternal round the wondering pole.[92]

Miss Seward, after stating that professional generosity distinguished
Dr.Darwin's medical practice at Lichfield, farther says, that
"diligently also did he attend to the health of the poor in that city,
and afterwards at Derby, and supplied their necessities by food, and all
sorts of charitable assistance.In each of those towns, _his_ was the
cheerful board of almost open-housed hospitality, without extravagance
or pride; deeming ever the first unjust, the latter unmanly.Generosity,
wit and science, were his household gods."[93] She again states that
when he removed from Lichfield to Derby, "his renown, as a physician,
still increased as time rolled on, and his mortal life declined from its
noon.Patients resorted to him more and more, from every part of the
kingdom, and often from the continent.All ranks, all orders of society,
all religions, leaned upon his power to ameliorate disease, and to
prolong existence.The rigid and sternly pious, who had attempted to
renounce his aid, from a superstition that no blessing would attend the
prescriptions of a sceptic, sacrificed, after a time, their
superstitious scruples to their involuntary consciousness of his mighty
skill."Mathias, though he severely criticizes some of Dr.Darwin's
works, yet he justly calls him "this very ingenious man, and most
excellent physician, for such he undoubtedly was."[Illustration]

From scattered passages in Miss Seward's Life of him, one can easily
trace the delight he took (notwithstanding his immense professional
engagements,) in the scenery of nature and gardens;--witness his
frequent admiration of the tangled glen and luxuriant landscape at
_Belmont_, its sombre and pathless woods, impressing us with a sense of
solemn seclusion, like the solitudes of _Tinian_, or _Juan Fernandes_,
with its "silent and unsullied stream," which the admirable lines he
addresses to the youthful owner of that spot so purely and temperately
allude to:--

   O, friend to peace and virtue, ever flows
   For thee my silent and unsullied stream,
   Pure and untainted as thy blameless life!Let no gay converse lead thy steps astray,
   To mix my chaste wave with immodest wine,
   Nor with the poisonous cup, which Chemia's hand
   Deals (fell enchantress!)So shall young Health thy daily walks attend,
   Weave for thy hoary brow the vernal flower
   Of cheerfulness, and with his nervous arm
   Arrest th' inexorable scythe of Time.So early, and indeed throughout his whole life, did Dr.Darwin enforce
the happy consequences of temperance and sobriety; from his conviction
of the pernicious effects of all kinds of intemperance on the youthful
constitution.He had an absolute horror of spirits of all sorts, however
diluted.Pure water was, throughout the greater part of his temperate
life, his favourite beverage.He has been severely censured (no doubt
very justly so), for some of his religious prejudices.Old Walter Mapes,
the jovial canon of Salisbury, precentor of Lincoln, and arch-deacon of
Oxford, in the eleventh century, considered _water_ as fit only for
_heretics_.One may again trace his fondness for the rich scenery of nature, when he
in 1777 purchased a wild umbrageous valley near Lichfield, with its
mossy fountain of the purest water.The
botanic skill displayed by him on this spot, did not escape the
searching eye of Mr.of
Gardening, he pays a deserved compliment to him.[94] Miss Seward wrote
some lines on this favoured valley, and these are part of them:

   O!may no ruder step these bowers profane,
   No midnight wassailers deface the plain;
   And when the tempests of the wintry day
   Blow golden autumn's varied leaves away,
   Winds of the north, restrain your icy gales,
   Nor chill the bosom of these hallow'd vales.His attachment to gardens, induced him to honour the memory of Mr.Mason, by lines once intended for his monument; and he was suggesting
improvements at the priory at Derby (and which he had just described the
last morning of his life in a sprightly letter to a friend), when the
fatal signal was given, and a few hours after, on the 18th of April,
1802, and in his sixty-ninth year, he sunk into his chair and expired."Thus in one hour (says his affectionate biographer) was extinguished
that vital light, which the preceding hour had shone in flattering
brightness, promising duration; (such is often _the cunning flattery of
nature_), that light, which through half a century, had diffused its
radiance and its warmth so widely; that light in which penury had been
cheered, in which science had expanded; to whose orb poetry had brought
all her images; before whose influence disease had continually
retreated, and death so often "turned aside his levelled dart!Darwin, as to his religious principles or prejudices, displayed
great errors of judgment in his _Zoonomia_, there can be no doubt.An
eminent champion of Christianity, truly observed, that Dr.Darwin "was
acquainted with more links in the chain of _second_ causes, than had
probably been known to any individual, who went before him; but that he
dwelt so much, and so _exclusively_ on second causes, that he too
generally seems to have forgotten that there is a first."For these
errors he must long since have been called to his account, before one
who can appreciate those errors better than we can.Though the _Accusing
Spirit_ must have blushed when he gave them in, yet, let us hope, that
the _Recording Angel_, out of mercy to his humane heart, and his many
good and valuable qualities, may have blotted them out for ever.WILLIAM GILPIN, who, as Mr.Dallaway, in his Observations on the
Arts, observes, "possesses unquestionably the happy faculty to paint
with words;" and who farther highly compliments him in his supplementary
chapter on Modern Gardening, annexed to his enriched edition of Mr.The Topographer says he "describes with the
language of a master, the artless scenes of uncultivated nature."Walpole in his postscript to his Catalogue of Engravers, after
premising, that it might, perhaps, be worth while "to melt down this
volume and new cast it," pays this tribute to him: "Were I of authority
sufficient to name my successor, or could prevail on him to condescend
to accept an office which he could execute with more taste and ability;
from whose hands could the public receive so much information and
pleasure as from the author of the _Essay on Prints_, and from the
_Tours_, &c.?And when was the public ever instructed by the pen and
pencil at once, with equal excellence in the style of both, but by Mr.Gilpin written nothing more than his "Lectures on the
Catechism," that alone would have conferred on him the name of a
meritorious writer.His allusion to Plato, his reflections on the Last
Judgment, his animated address to youth, and his conclusion of his
sixteenth lecture, must strike deep into the heart of every reader.His
"Sermons preached to a Country Congregation," prove him a pious,
charitable, and valuable man.[96]

The glowing imagery of his style, when viewing the beautiful scenery in
many parts of England, and some of the vast and magnificent ones of
Scotland, is fraught with many fervid charms.Mathias, in the remonstrance he so justly makes as to the
jargonic conceit of some of his language.Gilpin's first work on
picturesque beauty, was his Observations on the River Wye, made in the
year 1770.He afterwards published:

Forest Scenery--Picturesque Beauties of the Highlands--Mountains of
Cumberland and Westmoreland--Western parts of England--Cambridge,
Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex--Hampshire, Sussex and Kent.Three Essays, on
Picturesque Beauty, on Picturesque Travel, and on Sketching Landscape,
to which is added, a poem on Landscape Painting.A full account of his
numerous works may be seen in Watts's Bibl.A complete list of
them is also given by Mr.i. of his Illustrations, with
a brief memoir.Johnson also gives a list of such of his works as
relate to picturesque scenery, with their titles at large.His portrait
was painted by Walton, and engraved in metz by Clint.JAMES ANDERSON published the following works; and I have given the price
of such of them as appeared in the late Mr.Harding's Agricultural
Catalogue:--

     1.The Bee, or Literary Intelligencer, 18 vols.Recreations in Agriculture, Natural History, Arts and
     Miscellaneous Literature, 6 vols._Lond._ 3_l._ 10s.Essays relating to Agriculture and Rural Affairs, 3 vols.Practical Treatise on draining Bogs, 8vo.Practical Treatise on Peat Moss, 8vo.On Lime as a Cement and Manure, 8vo.An Account of the different kinds of Sheep found in the Russian
     Dominions, and amongst the Tartar Hordes, 8vo.Investigation of the Causes of Scarcity of 1800.Miscellaneous Thoughts on Planting Timber Trees, chiefly for the
     climate of Scotland, by Agricola, 8vo.Description of a Patent Hot-house, 1804.In "Public Characters of 1800 and 1801," a portrait is given of him, a
list of his works, and it thus speaks of him: "The manners of this
ingenious and very useful man were plain and frank, an indication of an
honest and good heart.He was benevolent and generous, a tender parent,
and a warm friend, and very highly respected in the circle of his
acquaintance."There is a portrait of him, painted by Anderson, and
engraved by Ridley.A copy is given in the Mirror, (published by Vernon
and Hood), of Nov.He died at West Ham, Essex, in 1808, aged 69.Lysons, in the
Supplement to his Environs of London, gives a few particulars of him.He was the youngest son of Sir Robert Walpole, who so
long guided the destinies of England, and whose attractive and
benevolent private life, seems to have fully merited the praise of
Pope's elegant muse:

   _Seen him I have; but in his happier hour
   Of social pleasure,--ill exchang'd for power--
   Seen him uncumber'd with the venal tribe,
   Smile without art, and win without a bribe._

The best portraits of this intelligent and acute writer, Horace Walpole,
are the portrait in Mr.Dallaway's richly decorated edition of the
Anecdotes of Painting, from Sir Joshua Reynolds, and that in Mr.Cadell's Contemporary Portraits, from Lawrence.Another portrait is prefixed to the ninth volume of his works, in 4to.1825, from a picture in the possession of the Marquis of Hertford.There
is another portrait, engraved by Pariset, from Falconot.Walpole
died in March, 1797, at his favourite seat at Strawberry-hill, at the
age of eighty.His manners were highly polished, from his having, during
the course of a long life, frequented the first societies.His
conversation abounded with interesting anecdote and playful wit.Felicity of narration, and liveliness of expression, mark his graceful
pen.The Prince de Ligne (a perfect judge) thus speaks of his _History
of the Modern Taste in Gardening_:--"Je n'en admire pas moins
l'eloquence, et la profondeur, de son ouvrage sur les jardins."Walpole himself says:--"We have given the true model of gardening to the
world: let other countries mimic or corrupt our taste; but let it reign
here on its verdant throne, original by its elegant simplicity, and
proud of no other art than that of softening nature's harshnesses, and
copying her graceful touch."18 of his Essays, pays high respect to Mr.Walpole, and differs from him "with great deference and reluctance."He
observes:--"I can hardly think it necessary to make any excuse for
calling Lord Orford, Mr.Walpole; it is the name by which he is best
known in the literary world, and to which his writings have given a
celebrity much beyond what any hereditary honour can bestow."Johnson observes:--"To his sketch of the improvements introduced by
Bridgman and Kent, and those garden artists, their immediate successors,
we may afford the best praise; he appears to be a faithful, and is, an
eloquent annalist."It is impossible to pass by this tribute, without
reminding my reader, that Mr.Johnson's own review of our ornamental
gardening, is energetic and luminous; as is indeed the whole of his
comprehensive general review of gardening, from the earliest period,
down to the close of the last century.He devoted himself to literary pursuits; was
a profound antiquary, and a truly worthy man.He died in 1800, aged 73,
at his chambers in the Temple, and was buried in the Temple church.The
attractive improvements in the gardens there, may be said to have
originated with him.He possibly looked on them as classic ground; for
in these gardens, the proud Somerset vowed to dye their white rose to a
bloody red, and Warwick prophesied that their brawl

                          ----in the Temple garden,
   Shall send, between the red rose and the white,
   A thousand souls to death and deadly night.He published,

     1.Observations on the more Ancient Statutes, 4to.To the 5th
     edition of which, in 1796, is prefixed his portrait.A translation of Orosius, ascribed to Alfred, with notes, 8vo.Tracts on the probability of reaching the North Pole, 4to.of the Archaeologia, is his paper On the Progress of
     Gardening.It was printed as a separate tract by Mr.Nichols, price
     1s.Miscellanies on various subjects, 4to.Nichols, in his Life of Bowyer, calls him "a man of amiable
character, polite, communicative and liberal;" and in the fifth volume
of his Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century,
he gives a neatly engraved portrait of Mr.Barrington, and some
memorials or letters of his.Boswell ("the cheerful, the pleasant,
the inimitable biographer of his illustrious friend"), thus relates Dr.Barrington:--"Soon after he
had published his excellent Observations on the Statutes, Johnson
waited on that worthy and learned gentleman, and having told him his
name, courteously said, 'I have read your book, Sir, with great
pleasure, and wish to be better known to you.'Thus began an
acquaintance which was continued with mutual regard as long as Johnson
lived."the learned author of Philological Enquiries,
thus speaks of Mr.Barrington's Observations on the Statutes:--"a
valuable work, concerning which it is difficult to decide, whether it is
more entertaining or more instructive."JOSEPH CRADOCK, Esq.whose "Village Memoirs" display his fine taste in
landscape gardening.This feeling and generous-minded man, whose gentle
manners, polite learning, and excellent talents, entitled him to an
acquaintance with the first characters of the age, died in 1826, at the
great age of eighty-five.This classical scholar and polished gentleman,
who had (as a correspondent observes in the Gentleman's Magazine for
January, 1827) "the habit of enlivening and embellishing every thing
which he said with a certain lightning of eye and honied tone of voice,"
shone in the first literary circles, and ranked as his intimate and
valued friends (among many other enlightened persons), David Garrick,
and Warburton, Hurd, Johnson, Goldsmith, Percy, and Parr.Johnson
called him "a very pleasing gentleman."Indeed, he appears from every
account to have been in all respects an amiable and accomplished person.He had the honour of being selected to dance a minuet with the most
graceful of all dancers, Mrs.Garrick, at the Stratford Jubilee.Farmer addressed his unanswerable Essay on the
Learning of Shakspeare.In acts of humanity and kindness, he was
surpassed by few.Pope's line of _the gay conscience of a life well
spent_, might well have been applied to Mr.When in
Leicestershire, "he was respected by people of all parties for his
worth, and idolized by the poor for his benevolence."This honest and
honourable man, depicted his own mind in the concluding part of his
inscription, for the banks of the lake he formed in his romantic and
picturesque grounds, in that county:--

   _Here on the bank Pomona's blossoms glow,
   And finny myriads sparkle from below;
   Here let the mind at peaceful anchor rest,
   And heaven's own sunshine cheer the guiltless breast._[97]

In 1773 he partly took his "Zobeide" from an unfinished tragedy by
Voltaire.On sending a copy to Ferney, the enlightened veteran thus
concluded his answer: "You have done too much honour to an old sick man
of eighty.I am, with the most sincere esteem and gratitude,

   "Sir, your obedient servant,
   "VOLTAIRE."[98]

I cannot refrain from adding a short extract from the above quoted
magazine, as it brings to one's memory another much esteemed and worthy
man:--"Here, perhaps, it may be allowable to allude to the sincere
attachment between Mr.Cradock, and his old friend Mr.Cradock an
annual visit at Gumley Hall; but on Mr.Cradock settling in London, the
intercourse became incessant, and we doubt not that the daily
correspondence which took place between them, contributed to cheer the
latter days of these two veterans in literature.They had both of them
in early life enjoyed the flattering distinction of an intimacy with the
same eminent characters; and to hear the different anecdotes elicited in
their animated conversations respecting Johnson and others, was indeed
an intellectual treat of no ordinary description.Nichols possessed a similarity in taste and judgment.They were both
endowed with peculiar quickness of comprehension, and with powers and
accuracy of memory rarely equalled."One may say of the liberal minded
Mr.Johnson, that his love of
literature was a passion that stuck to his last stand.Cradock have, since his decease, been published by Mr.J. B. Nichols, in
4 vols.They contain his Essay on Gardening and Village Memoirs.They are enriched by a miniature portrait of him, by Hone, in 1764, when
Mr.Cradock was in his prime of life, in his twenty-second year, and
when his piercing eyes and intelligent countenance, were thought to have
resembled those of Mr.Cradock, taken of him only a month before his decease.In the above
quoted magazine, is a copy of this profile, with a memoir.SIR JOSEPH BANKS.There is a fine portrait of him by Russel, engraved by
Collyer.Cadell's Contemporary Portraits is another fine one,
from the pencil of Lawrence.His portrait is preserved by the
Horticultural Society of London, and in the British Museum is his bust,
chiselled and presented by the Hon.A good copy of the
engraving by Collyer is in the European Magazine for Feb.1795, and
from the memoir there given I select the following:

"If to support the dignity of the first literary society in the world,
and by firmness and candour to conciliate the regard of its members; if
rejecting the allurements of dissipation, to explore sciences unknown,
and to cultivate the most manly qualities of the human heart; if to
dispense a princely fortune in the enlargement of science, the
encouragement of genius, and the alleviation of distress, be
circumstances which entitle any one to a more than ordinary share of
respect, few will dispute the claim of the person whose portrait
ornaments the present magazine.... In short, he is entitled to every
praise that science, liberality, and intelligence can bestow on their
most distinguished favourites."Pulteney, in his handsome dedication of his Sketches on the progress
of Botany, to Sir Joseph, thus alludes to his voyage with Cook:--"To
whom could a work of this nature with so much propriety be addressed, as
to him who had not only relinquished, for a series of years, all the
allurements that a polished nation could display to opulence; but had
exposed himself to numberless perils, and the repeated risk of life
itself, that he might attain higher degrees of that knowledge, which
these sketches are intended to communicate."The Academy of Sciences at Dijon, in their "Notice sur Sir Jos.Banks,"
thus apostrophizes his memory:--"Ombre de Banks!apparois en ce lieu
consacre au culte des sciences et des lettres; viens occuper la place
que t'y conservent les muses, accepter les couronnes qu'elles-memes
t'ont tressees!viens recevoir le tribut de nos sentimens, temoignage
sincere de notre douleur et de not regrets; et par le souvenir de tes
vertus, viens enflammer nos coeurs de cet amour pour le bien, qui fut
le mobile de toutes tes actions!Johnson, in his History of English Gardening, justly calls him "This
universal patron of the arts and sciences.Natural history was the
favourite of his scientific studies, and every part of it was enriched
by his researches."He again hails him as "a munificent friend of
science and literature."The name of Banks will always be associated
with that of Solander, the favourite pupil of Linnaeus, and with that of
the immortal Cook.De Lille closes his _Jardins_ with a most generous
and animated invocation to the memory of this intrepid navigator.The portrait of this eminent physician of Bath, is
engraved by Fitler, from a painting by Daniel, of Bath, in 1791.It is
prefixed to his "Influence of the Passions upon Disorders."He died in
August, 1824, at the age of eighty-one.He published,

     1.Essay on the Preservation of the Health of Persons employed in
     Agriculture, 1s.Miscellaneous Tracts relating to Natural History; selected from
     the principal writers of antiquity.Remarks on the Influence of Climate, Situation, Nature of
     Country, &c. The Encyclop.of Gardening calls this "a most
     interesting work."says "it
     displays an almost unlimited extent of learning and research."An Historical View of the Taste for Gardening and Laying out
     Grounds among the Nations of Antiquity._Dilly._

A list of his other works (nearly twenty in number), may be seen in the
Dictionary of Living Authors, or in vol.;
which last work says that the late Lord Thurlow, at whose table he was
almost a constant guest, declared that "he never saw such a man; that he
knew every thing, and knew it better than any one else."Falconer's Historical View of the Taste for Gardening.This honest, much-esteemed, and inoffensive man, though
so deservedly eminent as a botanist, published only the following work
on horticulture:--"Directions for Cultivating the Crambe Maritima, or
Sea-kale for the Use of the Table."A new edition, enlarged, with three
engravings.Loudon says, that this pamphlet has done more to
recommend the culture of _sea-kale_ and diffuse the knowledge of it,
than all his predecessors.Nearly three pages of the Encyclopaedia are
enriched with the result of all that has appeared on the cultivation of
this vegetable by English, Scotch, or French writers.Curtis have long been held in high esteem.The first number of his Flora Londinensis appeared in 1777.He commenced
his Botanical Magazine in 1787.His Observations on British Grasses,
appeared in a second edition, with coloured plates, in 1790.His
Lectures were published after his death, to which is prefixed his
portrait.He died
in 1799, was buried in Battersea church-yard, and on his grave-stone
these lines are inscribed:--

   _While living herbs shall spring profusely wild,
     Or gardens cherish all that's sweet and gay,
   So long thy works shall please, dear nature's child,
     So long thy memory suffer no decay._


THOMAS MARTYN, Professor of Botany at Cambridge, whose striking
portrait, from a picture by Russel, appears in Dr.Thornton's superb
work on botany.He died in June, 1825, in the ninetieth year of his age.His edition of Miller's Gardener's Dictionary, appeared in 4 vols.Johnson observes, that this work "requires no comment.It is
a standard, practical work, never to be surpassed."Martyn also
published _Flora Rustica_, a description of plants, useful or injurious
in husbandry, _with coloured plates_, 4 vols.There are portraits of him by Sir J. Reynolds, engraved
by Collyer and by Green; one by Cotes, engraved by Houston, in 1772; and
a profile by Pariset, after a drawing by Falconot.He died in 1796, aged
sixty-nine.He published,

     1.Plans and Views of the Buildings and Gardens at Kew.A Dissertation on Oriental Gardening, second edition, with
     additions.To which is annexed an Explanatory Discourse, 4to.This work gave rise to those smart satires, _An Heroic
     Epistle_, and _An Heroic Postscript_.HUMPHREY REPTON, Esq.His portrait is prefixed to his Observations on
the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening, folio.He also
published on this subject:

     1.Sketches and Hints on Landscape Gardening, folio, 1795.Enquiry into the Changes in Landscape Gardening, 8vo.On the Introduction of Indian Architecture and Gardening, folio,
     1808.A charming little
     essay inserted in the _Linn.Fragments on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening,
     4to.of Gardening, is some general
     information respecting Mr.WILLIAM FORSYTH, Esq.His portrait is prefixed to the seventh edition of
his Treatise on the Culture and Management of Fruit Trees, 8vo.1824;
also to the 4to.He also published
Observations on the diseases, defects, and injuries in all kinds of
Fruit and Forest Trees, with an account of a particular method of cure,
8vo.JAMES DICKSON, who established the well-known seed and herb shop in
Covent-garden, and died at the age of eighty-six, a few years ago,
appears to have been very much esteemed.His family at Croydon possess
his portrait, and there is another preserved by the Horticultural
Society.He married for his second wife a sister of the intrepid
traveller Mungo Park.Dickson, when searching for plants in the
Hebrides, in 1789, was accompanied by him.Handsome mention is made of
Mr.Dickson in the Life of Mungo Park, prefixed to the "Journal of a
Mission to the Interior of Africa."In the above life, the friendly and
generous assistance which Sir Joseph Banks shewed both to Mr.Dickson,
and to Mungo Park, is very pleasingly recorded.Dickson
is given in the 5th vol.He published,
Fasciculus Plantarum Cryptog.RICHARD PAYNE KNIGHT, Esq.author of The Landscape, a didactic poem,
4to.A second edition, _with a preface_, appeared in 4to.Knight, on the subject of
landscape scenery, except his occasional allusions thereto, in his
Analytical Enquiry into the Principles of Taste, the second edition of
which appeared in 8vo.This latter work embraces a variety of
subjects, and contains many energetic pages, particularly those on
Homer, and on the English drama.His philosophical survey of human life
"in its last stages," (at p.461), and where he alludes to "the hooks
and links which hold the affections of age," is worthy of all praise; it
is deep, solemn, and affecting.The other publications of this gentleman
are enumerated in Dr.Knight, in his Landscape,
after invoking the genius of Virgil, in reference to his

   _----O qui me gelidis in vallibus Hoemi
   Sistat, et ingenti ramorum protegat unbra,_

thus proceeds, after severely censuring Mr._Browne_, who

   ----bade the stream 'twixt banks close shaved to glide;
   Banish'd the thickets of high-bowering wood,
   Which hung, reflected o'er the glassy flood:
   Where screen'd and shelter'd from the heats of day,
   Oft on the moss-grown stone reposed I lay,
   And tranquil view'd the limpid stream below,
   Brown with o'er hanging shade, in circling eddies flow.Dear peaceful scenes, that now prevail no more,
   Your loss shall every weeping muse deplore!Your poet, too, in one dear favour'd spot,
   Shall shew your beauties are not quite forgot:
   Protect from all the sacrilegious waste
   Of false improvement, and pretended taste,
   _One tranquil vale!_[100] where oft, from care retir'd
   He courts the muse, and thinks himself inspired;
   Lulls busy thought, and rising hope to rest,
   And checks each wish that dares his peace molest.After scorning "wisdom's solemn empty toys," he proceeds:

     Let me, retir'd from business, toil, and strife,
   Close amidst books and solitude my life;
   Beneath yon high-brow'd rocks in thickets rove,
   Or, meditating, wander through the grove;
   Or, from the cavern, view the noontide beam
   Dance on the rippling of the lucid stream,
   While the wild woodbine dangles o'er my head,
   And various flowers around their fragrance spread.*       *       *       *       *

   Then homeward as I sauntering move along,
   The nightingale begins his evening song;
   Chanting a requiem to departed light,
   That smooths the raven down of sable night.After an animated tribute to _Homer_, he reviews the rising and the
slumbering, or drooping of the arts, midst storms of war, and gloomy
bigotry.Hail, arts divine!--still may your solace sweet
   Cheer the recesses of my calm retreat;
   And banish every mean pursuit, that dares
   Cloud life's serene with low ambitious cares.Vain is the pomp of wealth: its splendid halls,
   And vaulted roofs, sustain'd by marble walls.--
   In beds of state pale sorrow often sighs,
   Nor gets relief from gilded canopies:
   But arts can still new recreation find,
   To soothe the troubles of th' afflicted mind;
   Recall the ideal work of ancient days,
   And man in his own estimation raise;
   Visions of glory to his eyes impart,
   And cheer with conscious pride his drooping heart.After a review of our several timber trees, and a tribute to our native
streams, and woods; and after describing in happy lines _Kamtschatka's_
dreary coast, he concludes his poem with reflections on the ill-fated
_Queen of France_, whose

   Waning beauty, in the dungeon's gloom,
   Feels, yet alive, the horrors of the tomb!Knight's portrait, painted by Sir Thomas Lawrence, is preserved at
Downton Castle, near Ludlow; and is engraved among Cadell's Contemporary
Portraits.It is also engraved by Bromley, from the same painter.Another portrait was in the library of the late Mr.He died at Edinburgh in June 1828, at the great age
of eighty-four.His portrait was drawn by Raiburn, and engraved by
Mitchell.He was a contemporary of several eminent persons, whose
society and friendship formed one of the chief pleasures of his life.There was scarcely an institution proposed for the benefit of his native
city, Edinburgh, to which his name will not be found a contributor.He
was, in fact, the patron and benefactor of all public charities.In 1809
he projected, and by his exertions, succeeded in establishing, the
Horticultural Society of Edinburgh.His animated and scientific
discourses, delivered at the meetings of the Caledonian Horticultural
Society, will always be perused with eager pleasure by every
horticulturist.In that delivered in December, 1814, and inserted in the
fifth number of their Memoirs, this zealous well-wisher of his native
city, thus exults:--"I am now, gentlemen, past the seventieth year of my
age, and I have been a steady admirer both of Flora and Pomona from the
very earliest period of my youth.During a pretty long life, it has been
my lot to have had opportunities of visiting gardens in three different
quarters of the globe, in Europe, in Asia, and in Africa; and from what
I have seen, I am decidedly of opinion, that at the present day, there
is not a large city in the world, which enjoys a supply of vegetable
food in more abundance, in greater variety, or in higher excellence,
than the city of Edinburgh.From the potatoe to the pine-apple,--from
the most useful to the most delicious productions of the vegetable
kingdom, we are not at present outdone, as far as my observation goes,
by any large city on the face of the earth."His medical talents may
well be believed not to have been small, when it is told, that he was
the rival in practice, and by no means an unsuccessful one, of the
illustrious Cullen, of the Monros, and of Gregory.Duncan was eminently distinguished for his sociality, and the desire to
benefit all mankind.His
favourite amusement was _gardening_.He possessed a garden in the
neighbourhood of Edinburgh, which he cultivated entirely with his own
hands, and on the door of which was placed, in conspicuous letters,
'_hinc salus_.'He was particularly kind to the students attending his
lectures, and gave a tea-drinking every Sunday evening to about a dozen
of them, by rotation, who assembled at six o'clock and went away at
eight.When old, he used sometimes to forget the lapse of time, and in
his lectures, frequently spoke about the _late_ Mr.Haller, who lived a
century before.To the last year of his life he never omitted going up,
on the morning of the 1st of May, to wash his face in the dew of the
summit of a mountain near Edinburgh, called Arthur's Seat.He had the
merit of being the father of the present Dr.Duncan, the celebrated
author of the Edinburgh Dispensatory, and professor of materia medica.Duncan's funeral was properly made a public one, at which the
professors, magistrates, and medical bodies of Edinburgh attended, to
testify their sorrow and respect.His portrait was taken by Sir Thomas Lawrence, and is
now at Foxley.[101] The Hereford Journal of Wednesday, September 16,
1829, thus relates his decease:--"On Monday last died, at Foxley, in
this county, Sir Uvedale Price, Bart.in the eighty-third year of his
age.The obituary of 1829 will not record a name more gifted or more
dear!In a county where he was one of the oldest, as well as one of the
most constant of its inhabitants, it were superfluous to enumerate his
many claims to distinction and regret.His learning, his sagacity, his
exquisite taste, his indefatigable ardour, would have raised to eminence
a man much less conspicuous by his station in life, by his
correspondence with the principal literati of Europe, and by the
attraction and polish of his conversation and manners.Possessing his
admirable faculties to so venerable an age, we must deplore that a
gentleman who conferred such honour on our county is removed from that
learned retirement in which he delighted, and from that enchanting scene
which, in every sense, he so greatly adorned.He is succeeded in his
title by his only son, now Sir Robert Price, one of our
representatives."Sir Uvedale published the following:

     1.An Essay on the Picturesque, as compared with the Sublime and
     Beautiful, and on the use of studying pictures for the purpose of
     improving real landscape, 8vo.This volume was afterwards
     published in 1796, in 8vo.with _considerable additions_, and in
     1798 was published at _Hereford_ a second volume, being an Essay on
     Artificial Water, an Essay on Decorations near the House, and an
     Essay on Architecture and Buildings as connected with Scenery.A Letter to H. Repton, Esq.on the application of the practice
     and principles of Landscape Painting to Landscape Gardening.Intended as a supplement to the Essays.Second edition,
     _Hereford_, 1798, 8vo.This is a sportive display of pleasant wit,
     polished learning, and deep admiration of the great landscape
     painters.Keen as some of his pages are, and lamenting that there
     should have been any controversy ("or tilting at each other's
     breasts,") on the subject of Launcelot Browne's works, "I trust,
     (says he,) however, that my friends will vouch for me, that
     whatever sharpness there may be in my style, there is no rancour in
     my heart."Repton in his Enquiry into the Changes of Landscape
     Gardening, acknowledges "the elegant and gentleman-like manner in
     which Mr.Indeed, many pages in
     this present letter shew this.A Dialogue on the distinct Characters of the Picturesque and the
     Beautiful, in answer to the objections of Mr.Knight, 1801,
     8vo.[102]

A general review of Sir Uvedale's ideas on this subject, is candidly
given by Mr.after a mature study of
_all_ the modern writers who have endeavoured to form "a taste for the
harmony and connection of natural scenery."Loudon farther calls him
"the great reformer of landscape gardening."We have to regret, that though so many springs must have cheered the
long life of Sir Uvedale Price, (and which he calls the _dolce prima
vera, gioventu dell'anno_, and whose blossoms, flowers, and
"profusion of fresh, gay, and beautiful colours and sweets," he so
warmly dwelt on in many of his pages,) and though the number of these
springs must have nearly equalled those which gilded the days of Lord
Kames, of the honourable Horace Walpole, of Mr.Gilpin, and of Joseph
Cradock, Esq.yet we have to regret that his classic pen has presented
to the public no other efforts of his genius and cultivated taste, than
the few respectable ones above stated.Had he chose to have indulged his
own powers in describing what has been done towards "embellishing the
face of this noble kingdom," (to quote his own words,) we might have
perused descriptive pages equal to his own critical and refined review
of Blenheim, or of Powis Castle, and of a character as high and pure, as
those of Thomas Whateley.In proof of this, we need only refer to many
pages in his Essays,--not only when he so well paints the charms of
sequestered nature, whether in its deep recesses, _o'er canopied with
luscious eglantine_,--in the "modest and retired character of a
brook,"--the rural simplicity of a cottage, with its lilacs and fruit
trees, its rustic porch, covered with vine or ivy, but when he dwells on
the ruins and on "the religious calm" of our abbeys,[103] or on our old
mansion-houses, with their terraces, their summer-houses covered with
ivy, and mixed with wild vegetation.And we need farther only to refer
to those feeling pages in his second volume, where he laments that his
own youth and inexperience should (in order to follow the silly folly of
_being in the fashion_,) have doomed to sudden and total destruction an
old paternal garden, with all its embellishments, and whose destruction
revives in these pages all the emotions of his youth; and he concludes
these pages of regret, by candidly confessing, that he gained little but
"much difficulty, expence and dirt," and that he thus detains his
readers in relating what so personally concerns himself, "because there
is nothing so useful to others, however humiliating to ourselves, as
the frank confession of our errors and of their causes.No man can
equally with the person who committed them, impress upon others the
extent of the mischief done, and the regret that follows it."It is
painful to quit pages so interesting as those that immediately follow
this quotation.[104]

There are few objects that the enlightened mind of Sir Uvedale has not
remarked.Take the following as an instance:

"Nothing is so captivating, or seems so much to accord with our ideas of
beauty, as the smiles of a beautiful countenance; yet they have
sometimes a striking mixture of the other character.Of this kind are
those smiles which break out suddenly from a serious, sometimes from
almost a severe countenance, and which, when that gleam is over, leave
no trace of it behind--

   _Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
   That in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth,
   And e'er a man has time to say, behold!The jaws of darkness do devour it up._

There is another smile, which seems in the same degree to accord with
the ideas of beauty only: it is that smile which proceeds from a mind
full of sweetness and sensibility, and which, when it is over, still
leaves on the countenance its mild and amiable impression; as after the
sun is set, the mild glow of his rays is still diffused over every
object.This smile, with the glow that accompanies it, is beautifully
painted by Milton, as most becoming an inhabitant of heaven:

   To whom the angel, with a smile that glow'd
   Celestial rosy red, love's proper hue,
   Thus answered."The great object in the above Essays, is to improve the laying out of
grounds by studying the productions "of those great artists _who have
most diligently studied the beauties of nature_.On this subject he has
in these volumes poured forth the effusions of his richly gifted mind,
in his contemplation of the works of those really great painters, whose
landscape scenery, from the most rural to the grandest, "have been
consecrated by long uninterrupted admiration."Instead of the narrow,
mechanical practice of a few English gardeners, or layers-out of
grounds, he wishes "the noble and varied works of the eminent painters
of every age, and of every country, and those of _their_ supreme
mistress NATURE, should be the great models of imitation."[105] He has
supported many of his opinions or observations, or embellished or
enlivened them, by acute allusions, not only to Milton but to
Shakspeare, whom he calls "that most original creator, and most accurate
observer."[106]

He has depicted his own mind in p.378 of the first volume of his
Essays; for after lamenting that despotic system of improvement which
demands all to be laid open,--all that obstructs to be levelled to the
ground,--houses, orchards, gardens, all swept away,--nothing tending to
humanize the mind--and that a despot thinks every person an intruder who
enters his domain, wishing to destroy cottages and pathways, and to
reign alone, he thus proceeds:--"Here I cannot resist paying a tribute
to the memory of a beloved uncle, and recording a benevolence towards
all the inhabitants around him, that struck me from my earliest
remembrance; and it is an impression I wish always to cherish.It seemed
as if he had made his extensive walks as much for them as for himself;
they used them as freely, and their enjoyment was his.The village bore
as strong marks of his and of his brother's attentions (for in that
respect they appeared to have but one mind), to the comforts and
pleasures of its inhabitants.Such attentive kindnesses, are amply
repaid by affectionate regard and reverence; and were they general
throughout the kingdom, they would do much more towards guarding us
against democratical opinions

   _Than twenty thousand soldiers, arm'd in proof._

The cheerfulness of the scene I have mentioned, and all the interesting
circumstances attending it, (so different from those of solitary
grandeur,) have convinced me, that he who destroys dwellings, gardens
and inclosures, for the sake of mere extent, and parade of property,
only extends the bounds of monotony, and of dreary, selfish pride; but
contrasts those of vanity, amusement and humanity."One may trace, too, his feeling mind towards the conclusion of his
second volume, where, after many pleasing pages on the rural scenery of
cottages, and in hamlets and villages, ("where a lover of humanity may
find so many sources of amusement and interest,") and on the means of
embellishing them, "I could wish (says he) to turn the minds of
improvers from too much attachment to solitary parade, towards objects
more connected with general habitation and embellishment;... and it may
be truly said, that there is no way in which wealth can produce such
natural unaffected variety, and such interest, as by adorning a real
village, and promoting the comforts and enjoyments of its inhabitants._Goldsmith_ has most feelingly described (more, I trust, from the warmth
of a poetical imagination and quick sensibility than from real fact),
the ravages of wealthy pride.My aim is to shew, that they are no less
hostile to real taste, than to humanity; and should I succeed, it is
possible that those, whom all the affecting images and pathetic touches
of Goldsmith would not have restrained from destroying a village, may
even be induced to build one, in order to shew their taste in the
decoration and disposition of village-houses and cottages."After many
traces of village scenery, he thus proceeds: "The church, together with
the church-yard, is, on various accounts, an interesting object to the
villagers of every age and disposition; to the old and serious, as a
spot consecrated to the purposes of religion, where the living christian
performs his devotions, and where, after his death, his body is
deposited near those of his ancestors and departed friends, and
relations: to the young and thoughtless, as a place where, on the day of
rest from labour, they meet each other in their holiday clothes; and
also (what forms a singular contrast with tombs and grave-stones), as
the place which at their wakes, is the chief scene of their gaiety and
rural sports."After speaking of the yew, which from the solemnity of
its foliage, is most suited to church-yards, being as much consecrated
to the dead as the cypress among the ancients, he says that "there seems
to be no reason, why in the more southern parts of England, cypresses
should not be mixed with yews, or why cedars of Libanus, which are
perfectly hardy, and of a much quicker growth than yews, should not be
introduced.In high romantic situations, particularly, where the
church-yard is elevated above the general level, a cedar, spreading his
branches downwards from that height, would have the most picturesque,
and at the same time, the most solemn effect."Johnson's lately published History of
English Gardening, to add a very early tract on that subject, and I take
the liberty of transcribing his exact words: "A Boke of Husbandry,
London, 4to.This little work is very rare, being one of the productions
from the press of Wynkin de Worde.It consists of but twelve leaves, and
is without date, but certainly was not of a later year than 1500.'Here begyneth a treatyse of
Husbandry which Mayster Groshede somtyme Bysshop of Lyncoln made, and
translated it out of Frensshe into Englyshe, whiche techeth all maner of
men to governe theyr londes, tenementes, and demesnes ordinately.''Here endeth the Boke of Husbandry, _and of Plantynge, and Graffynge of
Trees and Vynes_.'"Nichols printed the Life of Robert
_Grosseteste_, the celebrated Bishop of Lincoln.With an Account of the Bishop's _Works_, &c. Illustrated with plates of
his Tomb, Ring, and Crosier.Page 17.--I have in this page alluded to the hard fate of Correggio.That my reader may know who he was, let him inspect those pages in vol.i. of Sir U. Price's Essays, where he thus concludes a critique on his
genius: "I believe that if a variety of persons, conversant in painting,
were asked what pictures (taking every circumstance together) appeared
to them most beautiful, and had left the softest and most pleasing
impression,--the majority would fix upon Correggio."Lawson, in the dedication to his New Orchard and Garden,
gives the name of an author on gardening, whose book I have not met
with.He dedicates it "to the right worshipfull _Sir Henry Belosses_,"
and he acknowledges, "1st.the many courtesies you have vouchsaved me.your delightfull skill in matters of this nature.the profit
which I received from your _learned discourse of Fruit-trees_.your animating and assisting of others to such endeavours.Last of all,
the rare worke of your owne in this kind, all which to publish under
your protection, I have adventured as you see."From this it would
appear, that this "learned discourse" is transfused into the New Orchard
and Garden.After all, perhaps, this "learned discourse" was merely in
conversation.At all events, it has recorded the name of Sir Henry as
warmly devoted to orcharding, or to horticulture.W. Lawson, in his
preface, dwells upon the praises of this art, "how some, and not a few
of the best, have accounted it a chiefe part of earthly happinesse to
have faire and pleasant orchards--how ancient, how profitable, how
pleasant it is."His fourteenth chapter is On the Age of Fruit-trees.After stating that some "shall dure 1000 years," and the age of many of
the apple-trees in his little orchard, he says: "If my trees be 100
yeares old, and yet want 200 of their growth before they leave
increasing, which make 300, then we must needs resolve, that this 300
yeere are but the third part of a tree's life, because (as all things
living besides) so trees must have allowed them for their increase one
third, another third for their stand, and a third part of time also for
their decay."--"So that I resolve upon good reason, that Fruit-trees
well ordered, may live and live 1000 yeeres, and beare fruit, and the
longer, the more, the greater, and the better, because his vigour is
proud and stronger, when his yeeres are many.You shall see old trees
put their buds and blossoms both sooner and more plentifully than young
trees by much.And I sensibly perceive my young trees to inlarge their
fruit, as they grow greater, both for number, and greatnesse."--"And if
Fruit-trees last to this age, how many ages is it to be supposed, strong
and huge Timber-trees will last?whose huge bodies require the yeeres of
divers _Methushalaes_, before they end their days; whose sap is strong
and better, whose barke is hard and thicke, and their substance solid
and stiffe: all which are defences of health and long life.Their
strength withstands all forcible winds."His seventeenth chapter is on
the Ornaments of an Orchard.I here give the whole of that chapter:


"Me thinks hitherto we haue but a bare Orchard for fruit, and but halfe
good, so long as it wants those comely ornaments, that should giue
beauty to all our labours, and make much for the honest delight of the
owner and his friends."For it is not to be doubted: but as God hath giuen man things
profitable, so hath he allowed him honest comfort, delight, and
recreation in all the workes of his hands.Nay, all his labours vnder
the sunne without this are troubles, and vexation of mind: For what is
greedy gaine, without delight, but moyling, and turmoyling slauery?But
comfortable delight, with content, is the good of euery thing, and the
patterne of heauen.A morsell of bread with comfort, is better by much
than a fat oxe with vnquietnesse.And who can deny, but the principall
end of an Orchard, is the honest delight of one wearied with the works
of his lawfull calling?The very workes of and in an Orchard and Garden,
are better than the ease and rest of and from other labours.When God
had made man after his owne image, in a perfect state, and would haue
him to represent himselfe in authority, tranquillity and pleasure vpon
the earth, he placed him in Paradise.but a Garden
and Orchard of trees and hearbs, full of pleasure?The gods of the earth, resembling the great God of heauen in
authority, maiestie, and abundance of all things, wherein is their most
delight?and whither doe they withdraw themselues from the troublesome
affaires of their estate, being tyred with the hearing and iudging of
litigious Controuersies?choked (as it were) with the close ayres of
their sumptuous buildings, their stomacks cloyed with variety of
Banquets, their eares filled and ouerburthened with tedious
discoursings?but into their Orchards, made and prepared,
dressed and destinated for that purpose, to renue and refresh their
sences, and to call home their ouer-wearied spirits.Nay, it is (no
doubt) a comfort to them, to set open their cazements into a most
delicate Garden and Orchard, whereby they may not onely see that,
wherein they are so much delighted, but also to giue fresh, sweet, and
pleasant ayre to their galleries and chambers."And looke, what these men do by reason of their greatnes and ability,
prouoked with delight, the same doubtlesse would euery of vs doe, if
power were answerable to our desires, whereby we shew manifestly, that
of all other delights on earth, they that are taken by Orchards, are
most excellent, and most agreeing with nature."For whereas euery other pleasure commonly filles some one of our
sences, and that onely, with delight, this makes all our sences swimme
in pleasure, and that with infinite variety, ioyned with no less
commodity."That famous philosopher, and matchlesse orator, M. T. C. prescribeth
nothing more fit, to take away the tediousnesse and heauy load of three
or foure score yeeres, than the pleasure of an Orchard."What can your eyes desire to see, your ears to hear, your mouth to
tast, or your nose to smell, that is not to be had in an Orchard, with
abundance and variety?What more delightsome than an infinite variety of
sweet smelling flowers?decking with sundry colours, the greene mantle
of the earth, vniuersall mother of vs all, so by them bespotted, so
dyed, that all the world cannot sample them, and wherein it is more fit
to admire the Dyer, than imitate his workemanship.Colouring not onely
the earth, but decking the ayre, and sweetning euery breath and spirit."The rose red, damaske, veluet, and double double prouince rose, the
sweet muske rose, double and single, the double and single white rose.The faire and sweet senting Woodbinde, double and single, and double
double.Purple cowslips, and double cowslips, and double double
cowslips.The violet nothing behinde the
best, for smelling sweetly.A thousand more will prouoke your content."And all these, by the skill of your gardner, so comely, and orderly
placed in your borders and squares, and so intermingled, that none
looking thereon, cannot but wonder, to see, what Nature corrected by Art
can doe."When you behold in diuers corners of your Orchard Mounts of stone, or
wood curiously wrought within and without, or of earth couered with
fruit-trees: Kentish cherry, damsons, plummes, &c. with staires of
precious workmanship.And in some corner (or moe) a true dyall or
Clocke, and some anticke workes, and especially siluer-sounding musique,
mixt instruments and voices, gracing all the rest: How will you be rapt
with delight?"Large walkes, broad and long, close and open, like the Tempe groves in
Thessalie, raised with grauell and sand, hauing seats and bankes of
cammomile, all this delights the minde, and brings health to the body."View now with delight the workes of your owne hands, your fruit-trees
of all sorts, loaden with sweet blossomes, and fruit of all tasts,
operations, and colours: your trees standing in comely order which way
soeuer you looke."Your borders on euery side hanging and drooping with feberries,
raspberries, barberries, currens, and the rootes of your trees powdred
with strawberries, red, white, and greene, what a pleasure is this?Your
gardner can frame your lesser wood to the shape of men armed in the
field, ready to giue battell: or swift running greyhounds: or of well
sented and true running hounds, to chase the deere, or hunt the hare.This kind of hunting shall not waste your corne, nor much your coyne."Mazes well framed a mans height, may perhaps make your friends wander
in gathering of berries, till he cannot recouer himselfe without your
helpe."To haue occasion to exercise within your Orchard: it shall be a
pleasure to haue a bowling alley, or rather (which is more manly, and
more healthfull) a paire of buts, to stretch your armes."Rosemary and sweete eglantine are seemely ornaments about a doore or
window, and so is woodbinde."And in mine opinion, I could highly commend your Orchard, if either
through it, or hard by it there should runne a pleasant riuer with
siluer streames: you might sit in your mount, and angle a pickled trout,
or sleightie eele, or some other dainty fish.Or moats, whereon you
might row with a boate, and fish with nettes."Store of bees in a dry and warme bee-house, comely made of fir-boords,
to sing, and sit, and feede vpon your flowers and sprouts, make a
pleasant noyse and sight.For cleanely and innocent bees, of all other
things, loue and become, and thriue in an Orchard.If they thriue (as
they must needes, if your gardner bee skilfull, and loue them: for they
loue their friends, and hate none but their enemies) they will, besides
the pleasure, yeeld great profit, to pay him his wages.Yea, the
increase of twenty stockes or stooles, with other fees, will keepe your
Orchard."You need not doubt their stings, for they hurt not whom they know, and
they know their keeper and acquaintance.If you like not to come amongst
them, you need not doubt them: for but neere their store, and in their
owne defence, they will not fight, and in that case onely (and who can
blame them?)Some (as that
Honorable Lady at Hacknes, whose name doth much grace mine Orchard) vse
to make seats for them in the stone wall of their Orchard, or Garden,
which is good, but wood is better."A vine ouer-shadowing a seate, is very comely, though her grapes with
vs ripe slowly."One chiefe grace that adornes an Orchard, I cannot let slip: A brood of
nightingales, who with their seuerall notes and tunes, with a strong
delightsome voyce, out of a weake body, will beare you company night and
day.She loues (and liues in) hots of woods in her hart.She will helpe
you to cleanse your trees of caterpillars, and all noysome wormes and
flyes.The gentle robin red-breast will helpe her, and in winter in the
coldest stormes will keepe a part.Neither will the silly wren be behind
in summer, with her distinct whistle (like a sweete recorder) to cheere
your spirits."The black-bird and threstle (for I take it the thrush sings not, but
deuoures) sing loudly in a May morning, delights the eare much (and you
neede not want their company, if you haue ripe cherries or berries, and
would as gladly as the rest do you pleasure:) But I had rather want
their company than my fruit.A thousand of pleasant delightes are attendant in an
Orchard: and sooner shall I be weary, than I can recken the least part
of that pleasure, which one that hath and loues an Orchard, may find
therein."What is there of all these few that I haue reckoned, which doth not
please the eye, the eare, the smell, and taste?And by these sences as
organes, pipes, and windowes, these delights are carried to refresh the
gentle, generous, and noble mind."To conclude, what ioy may you haue, that you liuing to such an age,
shall see the blessings of God on your labours while you liue, and
leaue behind you to heires or successors (for God will make heires) such
a worke, that many ages after your death, shall record your loue to
their countrey?And the rather, when you consider (chap.to what
length of time your worke is like to last."Page 30.--Having briefly glanced in this page at the delight with which
Sir H. Davy, Mr.Whateley, viewed the flowers of
spring, I can only add this reflection of Sturm:--"If there were no
stronger proofs on earth of the power, goodness, and wisdom of God, the
flowers of spring alone, would be sufficient to convince us of it."Page 45.--The character of this modest and candid man, (Switzer), has
found an able advocate in the honest pen of Mr.159
of his History of Gardening, after noticing the acrimony of his
opponents, observes, "Neglect has pursued him beyond the grave, for his
works are seldom mentioned or quoted as authorities of the age he lived
in.To me he appears to be the best author of his time; and if I was
called upon to point out the classic authors of gardening, _Switzer_
should be one of the first on whom I would lay my finger.His works
evidence him at once to have been a sound, practical horticulturist, a
man well versed in the botanical science of the day, in its most
enlarged sense."Johnson enumerates the distinct contents of each
chapter in the Iconologia--the Kitchen Gardener--and the Fruit Gardener.Page 59.--The Tortworth Chesnut was growing previous to the Norman
Conquest.Even in the reign of
Stephen, it was known as the great chesnut of Tortworth.Page 62.--The author of this treatise, who is a zealous orchardist, is
lavish in his praise of a then discovered apple-tree and its produce,
"for the little cot-house to which it belongs, together with the little
quillet in which it stands, being several years since mortgaged for ten
pounds, the fruit of this tree alone, in a course of some years, freed
the house and garden, and its more valuable self, from that burden."A
neighbouring clergyman, too, was equally lavish, for he "talked of it in
all conversations," and such was his praise of it, that every one "fell
to admiration."Stafford is so pleased with this reverend
gentleman's zeal, in extending the cultivation of this apple, (_the
Royal Wilding_) that he says, "I could really wish, whenever the
original tree decayeth, his statue carved out of the stump, by the most
expert hand, and overlaid with gold, may be erected near the public
road, in the place of it, at the common charge of the country."He
celebrates also another apple, which "in a pleasant conversation was
named by a gentleman _super-celestial_.Another gentleman, in allusion
to _Pynes_, the name of my house, and to the common story of the West
India pineapple, (which is said to be the finest fruit in the world, and
to represent every exquisite flavour that is known), determined that it
should be called the _pyne-apple_; and by either of these names it is
talked of when pleasantry and conversation bring the remembrance of it
to the table."Page 64.--It is but justice to Mr.Gibson to say, that in his Fruit
Gardener, he has entered fully into the merits of Le Genre's _Le maniere
de cultiver les arbres fruitiers_; and that his pages are extremely
interesting.The great merits of Quintinye are also not overlooked.Page 84.--To the list of those deceased authors, whose portraits I have
not been able to discover, I must add the following:


JOHN BRADDICK, Esq.A zealous horticulturist and fruit grower.He
contributed four papers to the Horticultural Society of London.1827, is a communication by him, on some new
French pears.The editor of this magazine acknowledges "the very liberal
and truly patriotic manner in which our highly-valued correspondent
shares every novelty he receives with those whose interest it is to
increase and disseminate such novelties."In the above magazine for
March, 1827, is another spirited communication by him, on these new
pears, introduced from France, in which he says:--"And here I think it
necessary to premise, that the following list is the cream skimmed off
some thousands of new pears, which I have for many years past been
getting together from various parts of the world, about two-thirds of
which yet remain for trial, not having fruited, together with some
thousands of seedling pears, apples, plums, cherries, apricots, peaches
and grapes, of my own raising; the fruits of some of which I hope will
continue to gladden the hearts of horticulturists for many years to
come.As they are produced I will make them known to the public, with as
much facility as lies in my power."_Boughton Mount, July 29, 1826._"

One is sorry to relate, that Mr.Braddick died soon after this
benevolent wish; for he died at the above seat of his, near Maidstone,
in April, 1828, at the age of sixty-three.Dibdin thus speaks of Archibald Alison: "The beautiful
and melodious style of this writer, renders his works deserving of a
conspicuous place in every well-chosen library."Page 89.--In this page I have stated that Dr.Dibdin says, "on many
accounts does G. Markham seem entitled to more notice and commendation."I have given extracts from his "English Husbandman," to shew his love
for flowers.The same attachment is visible where he enumerates them in
his "Country House-wive's Garden."--By the bye, though I have stated
this last work to be his, it surely appears to have been written by W.
Lawson.I merely now give the following extract from Markham's "English
House-Wife:"

"Next vnto this sanctity and holinesse of life, it is meet that our
English hous-wife be a woman of great modesty and temperance as well
inwardly as outwardly; inwardly, as in her behauiour and cariage towards
her husband, wherein she shall shunne all violence of rage, passion, and
humour, coueting lesse to direct then to be directed, appearing euer
vnto him pleasant, amiable, and delightfull, and though occasion,
mishaps, or the misgouernement of his will may induce her to contrary
thoughts, yet vertuously to suppresse them, and with a mild sufferance
rather to call him home from his error, then with the strength of anger
to abate the least sparke of his euill, calling in her mind that euill
and vncomely language is deformed though vttered euen to seruants, but
most monstrous and vgly when it appeares before the presence of a
husband: outwardly, as in her apparrell and diet, both which she shall
proportion according to the competency of her husband's estate and
calling, making her circle rather strait then large, for it is a rule if
we extend to the vttermost, we take away increase, if we goe a hayre
breadth beyond, we enter into consumption: but if we preserue any part,
we build strong forts against the aduersaries of fortune, prouided that
such preseruation be honest and conscionable: for a lauish prodigality
is brutish, so miserable couetuousnesse is hellish.Let therefore the
hus-wives garments be comly and strong, made aswel to preserue the
health, as adorne the person, altogether without toyish garnishes, or
the glosse of light colours, and as far from the vanity of new and
fantastick fashions, as neere to the comly imitations of modest
matrons."I must give an extract from his "Country Contentements," as he reminds
us of Shakspeare's lines on the tuneable cry of hounds; for Markham
dwells on their sweetness of cry--"their deepe solemne mouthes--their
roaring and loud ringing mouthes, which must beare the counter-tenor,
then some hollow plaine sweete mouthes--a deep-mouthed dog--a couple or
two of small singing beagles, which as small trebles, may warble amongst
them: the cry will be a great deale the more sweeter--the hollow deepe
mouth--the loud clanging mouthe--deepe flewed, such as for the most part
your _Shropshire_ and pure _Worcestershire_ dogs are--the louder and
pleasanter your cry will be, especially if it be in sounding tall woods,
or under the echo of rocks--and not above one couple of roarers, which
being heard but now and then, as at the opening or hitting of a scent,
will give much sweetnesse to the solemns, and gravenesse of the cry, and
the musick thereof will bee much more delightfull to the eares of every
beholder."Page 123.--The memory of Pope has perhaps never been more affectionately
honoured (nor that of Lord Mendip, who so zealously preserved every part
of the house and garden at Twickenham) than in the glowing and tender
lines of De Lille, in his poem of _Les Jardins_.The vignette in my title-page, and that at page 84, are two of those
neat decorations which so profusely embellish the Encyclopaedia of

FOOTNOTES:

    *       *       *       *       *


[1] Few persons have shewn more attachment to family portraits than Miss
Seward.This is strongly exemplified in several bequests in her will;
not only in her bequest to Emma Sneyd, and in that to Mrs.Powys, but
also in the following:--"The miniature picture of my late dear friend,
Mr.Saville, drawn in 1770, by the late celebrated artist Smart, and
which at the time it was taken, and during many successive years, was an
exact resemblance of the original, I bequeath to his daughter, Mrs.Smith, who I know will value and preserve it as a jewel above all prize;
and in case of her previous demise, I bequeath the said precious
miniature to her daughter, Mrs.Honora Jager, exhorting the said Honora
Jager, and her heirs, into whose hands soever it may fall, to guard it
with sacred care from the sun and from damp, as I have guarded it, that
so the posterity of my valued friend may know what, in his prime, was
the form of him whose mind through life, by the acknowledgment of all
who knew him, and could discern the superior powers of talent and
virtue, was the seat of liberal endowment, warm piety, and energetic
benevolence."Being thus on the subject of portraits, let me remark, that it is not
always that we meet with a faithful likeness.de
Genlis's _Petrarch et Laure_, justly observes, that "it is doubtful if
any of the portraits of _Petrarch_, which still remain, were painted
during his life-time.However that may be, it is impossible to trace in
them, either the elevation of his mind, the fire of his imagination, or
the pensive melancholy of his soul."In the Essays on Petrarch, by Ugo
Foscolo, he informs us, that "_Petrarch's_ person, if we trust his
biographers, was so striking with beauties, as to attract universal
admiration.They represent him with large and manly features, eyes full
of fire, a blooming complexion, and a countenance that bespoke all the
genius and fancy that shone forth in his works."Do we yet know one
really good likeness of _Mary Queen of Scots_?[2] It has often struck me (perhaps erroneously), that the attachment
which the great Sully evinced for gardens, even to the last period of
his long-protracted life, (eighty-two), _might_ in some degree have been
cherished or increased from the writings of the great Lord Bacon.When
this illustrious duke retired to his country seats, wounded to the heart
by the baseness of those who had flattered him when Henry was alive, his
noble and honest mind indulged in the embellishment of his gardens.I
will very briefly quote what history relates:--"The life he led in his
retreat at _Villebon_, was accompanied with grandeur and even majesty,
such as might be expected from a character so grave and full of dignity
as his.His table was served with taste and magnificence; he admitted to
it none but the nobility in his neighbourhood, some of the principal
gentlemen, and the ladies and maids of honour, who belonged to the
duchess of Sully.He often went into his gardens, and passing through a
little covered alley, which separated the flower from the kitchen
garden, ascended by a stone staircase (which the present duke of Sully
has caused to be destroyed), into a large walk of linden trees, upon a
terrace on the other side of the garden.It was then the taste to have a
great many narrow walks, very closely shaded with four or five rows of
trees, or palisadoes.Here he used to sit upon a settee painted green,
amused himself by beholding on the one side an agreeable landscape, and
on the other a second alley on a terrace extremely beautiful, which
surrounded a large piece of water, and terminated by a wood of lofty
trees.There was scarce one of his estates, those especially which had
castles on them, where he did not leave marks of his magnificence, to
which he was chiefly incited by a principle of charity, and regard to
the public good.At _Rosny_, he raised that fine terrace, which runs
along the Seine, to a prodigious extent, and those great gardens, filled
with groves, arbours, and grottos, with water-works.He embellished
_Sully_ with gardens, of which the plants were the finest in the world,
and with a canal, supplied with fresh water by the little river Sangle,
which he turned that way, and which is afterwards lost in the Loire.He
erected a machine to convey the water to all the basons and fountains,
of which the gardens are full.He enlarged the castle of _La Chapelle
d'Angillon_, and embellished it with gardens and terraces."These gardens somewhat remind one of these lines, quoted by Barnaby
Gooche:

   _Have fountaines sweet at hand, or mossie waters,
   Or pleasaunt brooke, that passing through the meads, is sweetly seene._

That fine gardens delighted Sully, is evident even from his own
statement of his visit to the Duke d'Aumale's, at Anet, near Ivry,
(where Henry and Sully fought in that famous battle), for he says,--"Joy
animated the countenance of Madame d'Aumale the moment she perceived me.She gave me a most kind and friendly reception, took me by the hand, and
led me through those fine galleries and beautiful gardens, which make
Anet a most enchanting place."One may justly apply to Sully, what he
himself applies to the Bishop of Evreaux: "A man for whom eloquence and
great sentiments had powerful charms."I had designed some few years ago, to have published a Review of some of
the superb Gardens in France, during the reign of Henry IV.and during
the succeeding reigns, till the demise of Louis XV., embellished with
plates of some of the costly and magnificent decorations of those times;
with extracts from such of their eminent writers whose letters or works
may have occasionally dwelt on gardens.--My motto, for want of a better,
might have been these two lines from Rapin,

   _----France, in all her rural pomp appears
   With numerous gardens stored._

Perhaps I might have been so greedy and insolent, as to have presumed to
have monopolized our Shakspeare's line,--"I love _France_ so well, that
I will not part with a village of it; I will have it all mine."Isaac Walton gives the following lines from a translation of a German
poet, which makes one equally fond of England:

   We saw so many woods, and princely bowers,
   Sweet fields, brave palaces, and stately towers,
   _So many gardens dress'd with curious care_,
   That Thames with royal Tiber may compare.[3] The Encyclopaedia of Gardening has a rich page (35) devoted to Le
Notre.thus records his genius and his grand and
magnificent efforts:--"Ce grand homme fut choisi pour decorer les
jardins du chateau de Vau-le-Vicomte.Il en fit un sejour enchanteur,
par les ornamens nouveaux, pleins de magnificence, qu'il y prodigua.On
vit alors, pour la premiere fois, des portiques, des berceaux, des
grottes, des traillages, des labyrinths, &c. embellir varier le
spectacle des jardins.Le Roi, temoin des ces merveilles, lui donna la
direction de tous ses parcs.Il embellit par son art, Versailles,
Trianon, et il fit a St.Germain cette fameuse terrasse qu'on voit
toujours avec une nouvelle admiration.Les jardins de Clagny, de
Chantilly, de St.Cloud, de Meudon, de Sceaux, le parterre du Tibre, et
les canaux qui ornent ce lieu champetre a Fontainbleau, sont encore son
ouvrage.Il demanda a faire voyage de l'Italie, dans l'esperance
d'acquerir de nouvelles connoissances; mais son genie createur l'avoit
conduit a la perfection.Il ne vit rien de comparable a ce qu'il avoit
fait en France."Notwithstanding the above just and high tribute, I have no hesitation in
saying, that it is not superior to the magic picture which the
fascinating pen of Mad.de Sevigne has drawn of le Notre's creative
genius, in her letter of Aug.Many others of this charming
woman's letters breathe her love of gardens.[4] The Nouveau Dict.thus speaks of the Pere Rapin:--"A un genie
heureux, a un gout sur, il joignoit une probite exacte, un coeur droit,
un caractere aimable et des moeurs douces.Il etoit naturellement
honnete, et il s'etoit encore poli dans le commerce des grands.Parmi
ses differentes Poesies Latines, on distingue le Poeme des Jardins.C'est son chef d'oeuvre; il est digne du siecle d'Auguste, dit l'Abbe
Des Fontaines, pour l'elegance et la purete du langage, pour l'esprit et
les graces qui y regnent."Among the letters of Rabutin de Bussy, are
many most interesting ones from this worthy father.[5] "Rien n'est plus admirable que la peinture naive que la Pere Vaniere
fait des amusemens champetres; on est egalement enchante de la richesse
et de la vivacite de son imagination, de l'eclat et de l'harmonie de sa
poesie, du choix de la purete de ses expressions.Il mourut a Toulouse
en 1739, et plusiers poetes ornerent de fleurs son tombeau."--Nouv.[6] La Comtesse de la Riviere, thus alludes to this convent: "Madame de
Sevigne a pour ce monastere une veneration qui est audela de toute
expression; elle assure qu'on n'approche pas de ce lieu sans sentir au
dedans de soi une onction divine."[7] The late Sir U. Price, pays a very high compliment to this exquisite
poem, in p.i. of his Essays, terming it full of the justest
taste, and most brilliant imagery.[8] In the Earl of Harcourt's garden, at Nuneham, in Oxfordshire, (laid
out in some parts under the eye and fine taste of the poet Mason), on a
bust of Rousseau are these lines:

   Say, is thy honest heart to virtue warm?Approach, behold this venerable form;
     'Tis Rousseau!There are attractive pages in this little volume of the Viscount's,
which would have interested either Shenstone, or Gainsborough,
particularly the pages 59, 143, 145, and 146, (of Mr.Malthus's
translation), for in these pages "we feel all the truth and energy of
nature."131, will enable the reader to judge of
the writer's style:--"When the cool evening sheds her soft and
delightful tints, and leads on the hours of pleasure and repose, then is
the universal reign of sublime harmony.It is at this happy moment that
Claude has caught the tender colouring, the enchanting calm, which
equally attaches the heart and the eyes; it is then that the fancy
wanders with tranquillity over distant scenes.Masses of trees through
which the light penetrates, and under whose foliage winds a pleasant
path; meadows, whose mild verdure is still softened by the transparent
shades of the evening; crystal waters which reflect all the near objects
in their pure surface; mellow tints, and distances of blue vapour; such
are in general the objects best suited to a western exposure.The sun,
before he leaves the horizon, seems to blend earth and sky, and it is
from sky that evening views receive their greatest beauty.The
imagination dwells with delight upon the exquisite variety of soft and
pleasing colours, which embellishes the clouds and the distant country,
in this peaceful hour of enjoyment and contemplation."[9] He was enthusiastically devoted to the cultivation of his gardens,
which exhibited enchanting scenery, umbrageous walks, and magnificent
water-falls.When thus breathing the pure air of rural life, the
blood-stained monsters of 1793 seized him in his garden, and led him to
the scaffold."He heard unmoved his own sentence, but the condemnation
of his daughter and grand-daughter, tore his heart: the thought of
seeing two weak and helpless creatures perish, shook his fortitude.Being taken back to the _Conciergerie_, his courage returned, and he
exhorted his children to prepare for death.When the fatal bell rung, he
recovered all his wonted cheerfulness; having paid to nature the tribute
of feeling, he desired to give his children an example of magnanimity;
his looks exhibited the sublime serenity of virtue, and taught them to
view death undismayed.When he ascended the cart, he conversed with his
children, unaffected by the clamours of the ferocious populace; and on
arriving at the foot of the scaffold, took a last and solemn farewell of
his children; immediately after he was dismissed into eternity."Sir Walter Scott, after noticing "the wild and squalid features" of
Marat, who "lay concealed in some obscure garret or cellar, among his
cut-throats, until a storm appeared, when, like a bird of ill omen, his
death-screech was again heard," thus states the death of another of the
murderers of the Malherbes:--"Robespierre, in an unsuccessful attempt to
shoot himself, had only inflicted a horrible _fracture on his
under-jaw_.In this situation they were found like wolves in their lair,
foul with blood, mutilated, despairing, and yet not able to die.Robespierre lay on a table in an anti-room, his head supported by a deal
box, and his hideous countenance half-hidden by a bloody and dirty cloth
bound round his shattered chin.As the fatal cars passed to the
guillotine, those who filled them, but especially Robespierre, were
overwhelmed with execrations.The nature of his previous wound, from
which the cloth had never been removed till the executioner _tore_ it
off, added to the torture of the sufferer.The shattered jaw dropped,
and the wretch yelled aloud, to the horror of the spectators.A mask
taken from that dreadful head was long exhibited in different nations of
Europe, and appalled the spectator by its ugliness, and the mixture of
fiendish expression with that of bodily agony."Malherbes loved to relate an answer made to him by a common
fellow, during his stay at Paris, when he was obliged to go four times
every day to the prison of the Temple, to attend the king: his extreme
age did not allow him to walk, and he was compelled to take a carriage.One day, particularly, when the weather was intensely severe, he
perceived, on coming out of the vehicle, that the driver was benumbed
with cold."My friend," said Malherbes to him, in his naturally tender
manner, "you must be penetrated by the cold, and I am really sorry to
take you abroad in this bitter season."--"That's nothing, M. de
Malherbes; in such a cause as this, I'd travel to the world's end
without complaining."--"Yes, but your poor horses could not."--"Sir,"
replied the honest coachman, "_my horses think as I do_."[10] I cannot pass by the name of Henry, without the recollection of
what an historian says of him: "L'Abbe Langlet du Fresnoy a publie
cinquante-neuf lettres de a bon Roi, dans sa nouvelle edition du Journal
de Henry III.on y remarque du feu de l'esprit, de l'imagination, et
sur-tout cette eloquence du coeur, qui plait tout dans un monarque.--On
l'exortoit a traiter avec rigueur quelques places de la Ligue, qu'il
avoit redites par la force: _La satisfaction qu'on tire de la vengeance
ne dure qu'un moment_ (repondit ce prince genereuse) _mais celle qu'on
tire de la clemence est eternelle_.Plus on connoitre Henri, plus on
l'aimera, plus on l'admiriroet."[11] The king, knowing his fine taste for sculpture and painting, sent
him to Italy, and the Nouv.gives this anecdote: "La Pape
instruit de son merite, voulut le voir, et lui donna une assez longue
audience, sur la fin de laquelle le Notre s'ecria en s'adressant au
Pape: J'ai vu les plus grands hommes du monde, Votre Saintete, et le Roi
mon maitre.Il y a grande difference, dit le Pape; le Roi est un grand
prince victorieux, je suis un pauvre pretre serviteur des serviteurs de
Dieu.Le Notre, charme de cette reponse, oublia qui la lui faisoit, et
frappant sur l'epaule du Pape lui repondit a son tour: Mon Reverend
Pere, vous vous portez bien et vous enterrerez tout la Sacre College.Le
Pape, qui entendoit le Francois, rit du pronostic.Le Notre, charme de
plus en plus de sa bonte, et de l'estime particuliere qu'il temoignoit
pour le Roi, se jeta au cou du Pape et l'embrassa.C'etoit au reste sa
coutume d'embrasser tous ceux qui publioient les louanges de Louis XIV.,
et il embrassoit le Roi lui-meme, toutes les fois que ce prince revenoit
de la campagne."[12] I will conclude by mentioning a justly celebrated man, who, it
seems was not over fond of his garden, though warmly attached both to
Boileau, and to Mad.de Sevigne,--I mean that most eloquent preacher
Bossuet, of whom a biographer, after stating that he was so absorbed in
the study of the ancient fathers of the church, "qu'il ne se permettoit
que des delassemens fort courts.Il ne se promenoit que rarement meme
dans son jardin.Son jardinier lui dit un jour: _Si je plantois des
Saint Augustins, et des Saint Chrysostomes, vous les viendriez voir;
mais pour vos arbres, vous ne vous en souciez guere_."Worlidge, who wrote during part of the reigns of Charles II.judiciously observes, that "the glory of the French
palaces, often represented to our English eyes in sculpture, are adorned
_with their beauteous gardens before them_; which wanting, they would
seem without lustre or grandeur."[14] He was fined L30,000 for having taken a favourite of the king's, in
the very presence chamber, by the nose, for having insulted him, and
afterwards dragging him out of the room.[15] It was to this nobleman, that Addison addressed his elegant and
sublime epistle, after he had surveyed with the eyes and genius of a
classical poet, the monuments and heroic deeds of ancient Rome.[16] Lord Chesterfield thus speaks of this distinguished man:--"His
private life was stained by no vices, nor sullied by any meanness.His
eloquence was of every kind; but his invectives were terrible, and
uttered with such energy of diction and countenance, that he intimidated
those who were the most willing and the best able to encounter him."Sir
W. Chatham Trelawney used to observe of him, that it was impossible for
the members of the side opposed to him in the House of Commons to look
him in the face when he was warmed in debate: he seemed to bid them all
a haughty defiance."For my own part," said Trelawney, "I never dared
cast my eyes towards his, for if I did, _they nailed me to the floor_."Smollet says, that he displayed "such irresistible energy of argument,
and such power of elocution, as struck his hearers with astonishment and
admiration.It flashed like the lightning of heaven against the
ministers and sons of corruption, blasting where it smote, and withering
the nerves of opposition; but his more substantial praise was founded
upon his disinterested integrity, his incorruptible heart, his
unconquerable spirit of independance, and his invariable attachment to
the interest and liberty of his country."Another biographer thus
mentions him:--"His elevated aspect commanded the awe and mute attention
of all who beheld him, whilst a certain grace in his manner, conscious
of all the dignities of his situation, of the solemn scene he acted in,
as well as his own exalted character, seemed to acknowledge and repay
the respect he received; his venerable form, bowed with infirmity and
age, but animated by a mind which nothing could subdue; his spirit
shining through him, arming his eye with lightning, and cloathing his
lips with thunder; or, if milder topics offered, harmonizing his
countenance in smiles, and his voice in softness, for the compass of his
powers was infinite.As no idea was too vast, no imagination too
sublime, for the grandeur and majesty of his manner; so no fancy was too
playful, nor any allusion too comic, for the ease and gaiety with which
he could accommodate to the occasion.But the character of his oratory
was dignity; this presided in every respect, even to his sallies of
pleasantry."[17] Sir Walter Scott's attachment to gardens, breaks out even in his
Life of Swift, where his fond enquiries have discovered the sequestered
and romantic garden of _Vanessa_, at Marley Abbey.[18] So thought Sir W. Raleigh;

   Sweet violets, love's paradise, that spread
     Your gracious odours...
   Upon the gentle wing of some calm-breathing wind,
       That plays amidst the plain.The lines in Twelfth Night we all recollect:

   That strain again;--it had a dying fall:
   O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet south
   That breathes upon a bank of _violets_,
   Stealing and giving odour.That these flowers were the most favourite ones of Shakspeare, there can
be little doubt--Perditta fondly calls them

   ----sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
   Or Cytherea's breath.When Petrarch first saw Laura: "elle avail une robe verte, sa coleur
favorite, parsemee de _violettes_, la plus humble des fleurs."--Childe
Harold thus paints this flower:

   The sweetness of the violet's deep blue eyes
   (Kiss'd by the breath of heaven) seems colour'd by its skies.[19] One almost fancies one perceives Lord Bacon's attachment to
gardens, or to rural affairs, even in the speech he made before the
nobility, when first taking his seat in the High Court of Chancery; he
hoped "that these same _brambles_ that _grow_ about justice, of needless
charge and expence, and all manner of exactions, might be rooted out;"
adding also, that immediate and "_fresh_ justice was the _sweetest_."Mason, in a note to his English Garden, after paying a high
compliment to Lord Bacon's picturesque idea of a garden, thus concludes
that note:--"Such, when he descended to matters of more elegance (for,
when we speak of Lord Bacon, to treat of these was to descend,) were the
amazing powers of this universal genius."Pope's delight in gardens, is visible even in the condensed
allusion he makes to them, in a letter to Mr.Digby; "I have been above
a month strolling about in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, from garden
to garden, but still returning to Lord Cobham's, with fresh
satisfaction.I should be sorry to see my Lady Scudamore's, till it has
had the full advantage of Lord Bathurst's improvements."[21] A biographer thus speaks of the Prince de Ligne: "Quand les rois se
reunirent a Vienne en 1814, ils se firent tous un devoir de l'accuellier
avec distinction, et furent enchante de la vivacite de son esprit, et de
son intarissable gaiete, qui malgre ses infirmites et son grand age, ne
l'avoit pasencore abandonne.Ses saillies, et ses bon mots etoient comme
autrefois repetes pour tous."His generous heart thus speaks of the
abused and unfortunate Marie Antoinette:--"The breath of calumny has not
even respected the memory of the loveliest and best of women, of whose
spotless heart and irreproachable conduct, no one can bear stronger
evidence than I. Her soul was as pure as her face was fair; yet neither
virtue nor beauty could save the victim of sanguinary liberty."In
relating this (says his biographer), his voice faultered, and his eyes
were suffused with tears.He thus briefly states, with his usual humour
and vivacity, his conversation with Voltaire as to the garden at Ferney:

_P.de L._--Monsieur, Monsieur, cela doit vous coupe beaucoup, quel
charmant jardin!mon jardinier est un bete: c'est moi meme qui ait fait
tout.[22] Monsieur Thomas, in his eulogy of Descartes says, it should have
been pronounced at the foot of Newton's statue: or rather, Newton
himself should have been his panegyrist.Of this eulogy, Voltaire, in a
most handsome letter to Mons.Thomas, thus speaks:--"votre ouvrage
m'enchante d'un bout a l'autre, et Je vais le relire des que J'aurai
dicte ma lettre."The sleep and expanding of flowers are most
interestingly reviewed by Mr.187 of his Encyclop., and by
M. V. H. de Thury, in the above discourse, a few pages preceding his
seducing description of the magnificent garden of M. de Boursault.So late ago as the year 1804 it was proposed at Avignon, to erect an
obelisk in memory of Petrarch, at Vaucluse: "il a ete decide, qu'on
l'elevera, vis-avis _l'ancien jardin_ de Petrache, lieu ou le lit de
sorgue forme un angle."Walpole observes) was planted by the poet,
enriched by him with the fairy gift of eternal summer.Pope thus mentions the vines round this cave:--

   Depending vines the shelving cavern skreen,
   With purple clusters blushing through the green.are devoted to a very
interesting research on the gardens of the Romans.Sir Joseph Banks has
a paper on the Forcing Houses of the Romans, with a list of Fruits
cultivated by them, now in our gardens, in vol.Pulteney gives a list of several manuscripts in the Bodleian
Library, the writers of which are unknown, and the dates not precisely
determined, but supposed to have been written, if not prior to the
invention of printing, at least before the introduction of that art into
England.I select the two following.--

No.De Arboribus, Aromatis, et _Floribus_.Glossarium Latino-anglicum Arborum, _Fructuum_, Frugam, &c.

And he states the following from Bib.S. Petri Cant:--

No.Notabilia de Vegetabilibus, et Plantis.Pulteney observes, that the above list might have been considerably
extended, but that it would have unnecessarily swelled the article he
was then writing.mentions a personage whose attachment to his
garden, and one of whose motives for cultivating that garden, does not
deserve a notice:--"Attale III.Roi de Pergame, fils de Stratonice,
soulla la throne en repandant le sang de ses amis et de sea parens.Il
abandonna ensuite le soin de ses affaires _pour s'occuper entirement de
son jardin_.Il y cultivoit des poisons, tels que l'aconit et la cigue,
qu'il envoyoit quelque fois en present a ses amis.Il mourut 133 ans
avant Jesus Christ."[27] To have completed the various contrasting vicissitudes of this poor
_Suffolk_ farmer's life, he should have added to his other employments,
those of another _Suffolk_ man, the late W. Lomax, who had been
_grave-digger_ at the pleasant town of Bury St.Edmund's, for thirty-six
years, and who, also, for a longer period than thirty-six years, had
been a _morrice-dancer_ at all the elections for that borough.[28] Gerarde, speaking of good sorts of apples and pears, thus mentions
the above named _Pointer_:--"Master Richard Pointer has them all growing
in his ground at Twickenham, near London, who is a most cunning and
curious grafter and planter of all manner of rare fruits; and also in
the ground of an excellent grafter and painful planter, Master Henry
Bunbury, of Touthil-street, near unto Westminster; and likewise in the
ground of a diligent and most affectionate lover of plants, Master
Warner, neere Horsely Down, by London; and in divers other grounds about
London."[29] The fate of this poor man reminds one of what is related of
Corregio:--"He received from the mean canons of Parma, for his
Assumption of the Virgin, the small pittance of two hundred livres, and
it was paid him in copper.He hastened with the money to his starving
family; but as he had six or eight miles to travel from Parma, the
weight of his burden, and the heat of the climate, added to the
oppression of his breaking heart, a pleurisy attacked him, which, in
three days, terminated his existence and his sorrows in his fortieth
year."If one could discover a portrait of either of the authors mentioned in
the foregoing list, one might, I think, inscribe under each of such
portraits, these verses:

   Ce pourtrait et maint liure
   Par le peintre et l'escrit,
   Feront reuoir et viure
   Ta face et ton esprit.They are inscribed under an ancient portrait, done in 1555, which Mr.Dibdin has preserved in his account of Caen, and which he thus
introduces: "As we love to be made acquainted with the _persons_ of
those from whom we have received instruction and pleasure, so take,
gentle reader, a representation of Bourgueville."John Parkinson, an apothecary of this city, (yet living, and
labouring for the common good,) in the year 1629, set forth a work by
the name of _Paradisus Terrestris_, wherein he gives the figures of all
such plants as are preserved in gardens, for the beauty of their
flowers, in use in meats or sauces; and also an orchard for all trees
bearing fruit, and such shrubs as for their beauty are kept in orchards
and gardens, with the ordering, planting, and preserving of all these.In this work he hath not superficially handled these things, but
accurately descended to the very varieties in each species, wherefore I
have now and then referred my reader, addicted to these delights, to
this work, especially in flowers and fruits, wherein I was loth to spend
too much time, especially seeing I could adde nothing to what he had
done upon that subject before."Hartlib (says Worlidge) tells you of the benefits of _orchard
fruits_, that they afford curious walks for pleasure, food for cattle in
the spring, summer, and winter, (meaning under their shadow,) fewel for
the fire, shade for the heat, physick for the sick, refreshment for the
sound, plenty of food for man, and that not of the worst, and drink also
of the best."Milton also in the above Tractate thus speaks:--"In those vernal seasons
of the year, when the air is calm and pleasant, it were an injury and
sullenness against nature, not to go out and see her riches, and partake
in her rejoicing with heaven and earth."[32] In the above tract of Dr.Beale's, he thus breaks out in praise of
the Orchards of this _deep and rich_ county:--"From the greatest person
to the poorest cottager, all habitations are encompassed with orchards,
and gardens, and in most places our hedges are enriched with rows of
fruit trees, pears or apples.All our villages, and generally all our
highways, (all our vales being thick set with rows of villages), are in
the spring time sweetened and beautified with the blossomed trees, which
continue their changeable varieties of ornament, till (in the end of
autumn), they fill our garners with pleasant fruit, and our cellars with
rich and winy liquors.Orchards, being the pride of our county, do not
only sweeten, but also purify the ambient air, which I conceive to
conduce very much to the constant health and long lives for which our
county hath always been famous.We do commonly devise a shadowy walk
from our gardens, through our orchards (which is the richest, sweetest,
and most embellished grove) into our coppice woods, or timber woods."Beale does not praise the whole of their land.He describes some as
"starvy, chapt, and cheany, as the basest land upon the Welch
mountains."He makes amends, however, for this, for he describes the
nags bred on their high grounds, as very different from our present
hackney-coach horses; they "are airey and sinewy, full of spirits and
vigour, in shape like the _barbe_, they rid ground, and gather courage
and delight in their own speed."[33] A Lady Gerard is mentioned in two letters of Mr.Pope, to W.
Fortescue, Esq.They appear in Polwhele's
History of Devonshire."I have just received a note from Mrs.Blount,
that she and Lady Gerard will dine here to-day."And "Lady Gerard was to
see Chiswick Gardens (as I imagined) and therefore forced to go from
hence by five; it was a mortification to Mrs.Blount to go, when there
was a hope of seeing you and Mr.There are three more
letters, without date, to Martha Blount, written from the Wells at
Bristol, and from Stowe, in which Pope says, "I have no more room but to
give Lady Gerard my hearty services."And "once more my services to Lady
Gerard.""I desire you will write a post-letter to my man John, at what
time you would have the pine apples, to send to Lady Gerard."Probably
Martha Blount's Lady Gerard was a descendant of Rea's.[34] A most curious account of the _Tulipomania_, or rage for tulips,
formerly in Holland, may be seen in Phillips's Flora Historica.[35] Perhaps no one more truly painted rich pastoral scenes than Isaac
Walton.This occurs in many, many pages of his delightful _Angler_.The
late ardently gifted, and most justly lamented Sir Humphry Davy too, in
his _Salmonia_, has fondly caught the charms of Walton's pages.His pen
riots in the wild, the beautiful, the sweet, delicious scenery of
nature:--"how delightful in the early spring, to wander forth by some
clear stream, to see the leaf bursting from the purple bud, to scent the
odours of the bank, perfumed by the violet, and enamelled as it were
with the primrose, and the daisy; to wander upon the fresh turf below
the shade of trees, whose bright blossoms are filled with the music of
the bee."Worlidge, in his Systema Agriculturae, says, that the
delights in angling "rouzes up the ingenious early in the spring
mornings, that they have the benefit of the sweet and pleasant morning
air, which many through sluggishness enjoy not; so that health (the
greatest treasure that mortals enjoy) and pleasure, go hand in hand in
this exercise.What can be more said of it, than that the most
ingenious, most use it."Whately, in his usual charming style, thus
paints the spring:--"Whatever tends to animate the scene, accords with
the season, which is full of youth and vigour, fresh and sprightly,
brightened by the verdure of the herbage, and the woods, gay with
blossoms, and flowers, and enlivened by the songs of the birds in all
their variety, from the rude joy of the skylark, to the delicacy of the
nightingale."[36] Tusser seems somewhat of Meager's opinion:--

   Sow peason and beans, in the wane of the moon,
   Who soweth them sooner, he soweth too soon;
   That they with the planet may rest and arise,
   And flourish, with bearing most plentifull wise.The celebrated Quintinye says, "I solemnly declare, that after a
diligent observation of the moon's changes for thirty years together,
and an enquiry whether they had any influence in gardening, the
affirmative of which has been so long established among us, I perceive
it was no weightier than old wives' tales."Mavor) having an influence on the tides and the
weather, she was formerly supposed to extend her power over all nature.There is a treatise, by _Claude Gadrois_, on the _Influences des
Astres_.Surely this merits perusal, when the Nouv.thus
speaks of him:--"Il etoit ami du celebre Arnauld et meritoit de l'etre
par _la justesse de son esprit_ et la purete de ses moeurs, par la bonte
de son caractere et par la droiture de son coeur."The following wise experiment occurs in an ancient book on husbandry;
but if the two parties there mentioned had lived with Leonard Meager,
one must not do him the injustice of supposing he would have been a
convert to their opinion:--"_Archibius_ is said to have written (or sent
word most likely) to _Antiochus_, king of _Syria_, that if you bury a
speckled toad inclosed in an earthen pot, in the middle of your garden,
the same will be defended from all hurtful weather and tempests."Meager, however, is kept in countenance by Mr.Worlidge, who, in his
chapter of Prognostics, at the end of his interesting Systemae
Agriculturae, actually states that

If dog's guts rumble and make a noise, it presageth rain or snow.The cat, by washing her face, and putting her foot over her ear,
foreshews rain.The squeaking and skipping up and down of mice and rats, portend rain.Leonard Meager thus notices a nurseryman of his day:--"Here follows a
catalogue of divers sorts of fruits, which I had of my very loving
friend, Captain Garrle, dwelling at the great nursery between
Spittlefields and Whitechapel; a very eminent and ingenious nurseryman."Perhaps this is the same nurseryman that Rea, in his _Pomona_, mentions.He says (after naming some excellent pear-trees) "they may be had out of
the nurseries about London, especially those of Mr.Leonard _Girle_, who will faithfully furnish such as desire these,
or any other kinds of rare fruit-trees, of whose fidelity in the
delivery of right kinds, I have had long experience in divers
particulars, a virtue not common to men of that profession."At this
period, the space between Spittlefields and Whitechapel, must have
consisted of gardens, and perhaps superb country houses.The Earl of
Devonshire had a fine house and garden near Petticoat-lane.Sir W.
Raleigh had one near Mile-end.Some one (I forget the author) says, "On
both sides of this lane (Petticoat-lane) were anciently hedges and rows
of elm trees, and the pleasantness of the neighbouring fields induced
several gentlemen to build their houses here; among whom was the Spanish
Ambassador, whom Strype supposes was Gondamour."Gondamour was the
person to please whom (or rather that James might the more easily marry
his son Charles to one of the daughters of Spain, with her immense
fortune) this weak monarch was urged to sacrifice the life of Raleigh.Within one's own memory, it is painful to reflect, on the many pleasant
fields, neat paddocks, rural walks, and gardens, (breathing pure air)
that surrounded this metropolis for miles, and miles, and which are now
ill exchanged for an immense number of new streets, many of them the
receptacles only of smoke and unhealthiness.[37] These lines are from him, at whose death (says Sir W. Scott in his
generous and glowing eulogy) we were stunned "by one of those
death-notes which are peeled at intervals, as from an archangel's
trumpet"--they are from "that mighty genius which walked amongst men as
something superior to ordinary mortality, and whose powers were beheld
with wonder, and something approaching to terror, as if we knew not
whether they were of good or evil"--they are from "that noble tree which
will never more bear fruit, or blossom!which has been cut down in its
strength, and the past is all that remains to us of Byron: whose
excellences will _now_ be universally acknowledged, and his faults (let
us hope and believe) not remembered in his epitaph."His "deep
transported mind" (to apply Milton's words to him) thus continues his
moralization:--

   What are the hopes of man?old Egypt's king
     CHEOPS, erected the first pyramid,
   And largest; thinking it was just the thing
     To keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;



   But somebody or other rummaging,
     Burglariously broke his coffin's lid:
   Let not a monument give you, or me, hopes,
   Since not a pinch of dust remains of CHEOPS.The Quarterly Review, in reviewing Light's Travels, observes, that
"Cheops employed three hundred and sixty thousand of his subjects for
twenty years in raising this pyramid, or pile of stones, equal in weight
to six millions of tons; and to render his precious dust more secure,
the narrow chamber was made accessible only by small intricate passages,
obstructed by stones of an enormous weight, and so carefully closed,
externally, as not to be perceptible.Yet how vain are all the
precautions of man!Not a bone was left of Cheops, either in the stone
coffin, or in the vault, when Shaw entered the gloomy chamber."Sir
Walter Scott himself, has justly received many eulogies.Perhaps none
more heart-felt, than the effusion delivered at a late Celtic meeting,
by that eloquent and honest lawyer, the present Lord Chief Justice of
the Court of Exchequer, in Scotland, which was received by long, loud,
and continued applause.[38] John Bauhine wrote a Treatise in 1591, De Plantis a Divis sanctisve
nomen habentibus.has this observation: "Plants, when
taken from the places whence they derive their extraction, and planted
in others of different qualities, _betray such fondness for their native
earth_, that with great difficulty they are brought to thrive in
another; and in this it is that the florist's art consists; for _to
humour each plant_ with the soil, the sun, the shade, the degrees of
dryness or moisture, and the neighbourhood it delights in, (for there is
a natural antipathy between some plants, insomuch that they will not
thrive near one another) are things not easily attainable, but by a
length of study and application."[39] What these ruffles and lashes were, I know not.Perhaps the words
of Johnson may apply to them:--

   Fate never wounds more deep the generous heart,
   Than when a blockhead's insult points the dart.This mournful truth is every where confess'd,
   Slow rises worth, by poverty oppress'd.[40] Barnaby Gooche, in his Chapter on Gardens, calls the sun "the
captaine and authour of the other lights, _the very soule of the
world_."[41] A translation of De Lille's garden thus pleads:--

   Oh!by those shades, beneath whose evening bowers
   The village dancers tripp'd the frolic hours;
   By those deep tufts that show'd your fathers' tombs,
   Spare, ye profane, their venerable glooms!To violate their sacred age, beware,
   Which e'en the awe-struck hand of time doth spare.Whateley observes, that "The whole range of nature is open to
him, (the landscape gardener) from the parterre to the forest; and
whatever is agreeable to the senses, or the imagination, he may
appropriate to the spot he is to improve; it is a part of his business
to collect into one place, the delights which are generally dispersed
through different species of country."[43] At page 24 he says, "_Cato_, one of the most celebrated writers on
Husbandry and Gardening among the Romans, (who, as appears by his
Introduction, took the model of his precepts from the _Greeks_) in his
excellent Treatise _De Re Rustica_, has given so great an encomium on
the excellence and uses of this good plant, (the Brocoli) not only as to
its goodness in eating, but also in physick and pharmacy, that makes it
esteemed one of the best plants either the field or garden produces."[44] His Chapter on the Water-Works of the Ancient Romans, French, &c.
is charmingly written.Those who delight in the formation of rivers,
fountains, falls of water, or cascades, as decorations to their gardens,
may inspect this ingenious man's Hydrostatics.And another specimen of
his genius may be seen in the magnificent iron gateway now remaining at
_Leeswood_, near Mold, and of which a print is given in Pugh's _Cambria
Depicta_.[45] In this volume is a letter written to Switzer, from his "ingenious
friend Mr.Thomas Knowlton, Gardener to the Earl of Burlington, who, on
account of his own industry, and the opportunity he has had of being
educated under the late learned Dr.Sherrard, claims a very advanced
place in the list of Botanists."This letter is dated Lansborough, July,
1728.I insert part of this letter:--"I hope, Sir, you will excuse the
freedom I take in giving you my opinion, having always had a respect for
your endeavours in Husbandry and Gardening, ever since you commenced an
author.Your introduction to, and manner of handling those beloved
subjects, (the sale of which I have endeavoured to promote) is in great
esteem with me; being (as I think) the most useful of any that have been
wrote on these useful subjects.If on any subject, you shall hereafter
revise or write farther upon, any communication of mine will be useful
or serviceable to you, I shall be very ready to do it.I heartily wish
you success in whatever you undertake, as it tends to a publick good."Pulteney says of Knowlton, "His zeal for English Botany was
uncommonly great, and recommended him successfully to the learned
Botanists of this country.From Sir Hans Sloane, he received eminent
civilities."[46] few short notices occur of names formerly eminent in
gardening:--"My late ingenious and laborious friend, Mr._Oram_,
Nurseryman, of Brompton-lane.""That great virtuoso and encourager of gardening, Mr."Their beautiful aspects in pots, (the nonpareil) and the middle of a
desert, has been the glory of one of the most generous encouragers of
gardening this age has produced, I mean the Right Honourable the Lord
Castlemain.""The late noble and most publick spirited encourager of arts and
sciences, especially gardening, his Grace the Duke of Montague, at
Ditton.""The Elrouge Nectarine is also a native of our own, the name being the
reverse of _Gourle_, a famous Nurseryman at Hogsden, in King Charles the
Second's time, by whom it was raised."And speaking of the successful cultivation of vines in the open air, he
refers to the garden of a Mr._Rigaud_, near _Swallow-street_; and to
another great cultivator of the vine, "of whose friendship I have proof,
the Rev._Only_, of _Cottesmore_, in Rutland, some time since
deceased; one of the most curious lovers of gardening that this or any
other age has produced."This gentleman, in 1765, published "An Account
of the care taken in most civilized nations for the relief of the poor,
more particularly in the time of scarcity and distress;" 4to.I believe the same gentleman also published, in 1765, a Treatise "Of the
Price of Wheat."[47] Lord Bacon says, "Because the breath of flowers is far sweeter in
the air (where it comes and goes, like the warbling of musick) than in
the hand, therefore nothing is more fit for that delight, than to know
what be the flowers and plants that do best perfume the air."The Prince
de Ligne says,

   Je ne veux point avoir l'orgueilleuse tulipe;
   _L'odorat en jardin_ est mon premier principe.The translation of _Spectacle de la Nature_, a very pleasing work,
observes that "Flowers are not only intended to beautify the earth with
their shining colours, but the greatest part of them, in order to render
the entertainment more exquisite, diffuse a fragrance that perfumes all
the air around us; and it should seem as if they were solicitous to
_reserve their odours for the evening and morn_, when walking is most
agreeable; but their sweets are very faint during the heat of the day,
when we visit them the least."I must again trespass on the pages of the great Bacon, by briefly
shewing the _natural wildness_ he wishes to introduce into one part of
his garden:--"thickets, made only of sweet-briar and honeysuckle, and
some wild vine amongst, and the ground set with violets, strawberries,
and primroses; for these are sweet, and prosper in the shade."The dew or pearly drops that one sees in a morning on cowslips, remind
one of what is said of Mignon:--"Ses ouvrages sont precieux par l'art
avec le quel il representoit les fleurs dans tout leur eclat, et les
fruits avec toute leur fraicheur.La rosee et les goutes d'eau qu'elle
repand sur les fleurs, sont si bien imitees dans ses tableaux, qu'on est
tente d'y porter la main."It is said also that in the works of
Van-Huysum, "le veloute des fruits, l'eclat des fleurs, le transparent
de la rosee, tout enchante dans les tableaux de ce peintre admirable."Sir U. Price observes of this latter painter, "that nature herself is
hardly more soft and delicate in her most delicate productions, than the
copies of them by Van-Huysum."Two flower pieces by this painter, sold
at the Houghton sale for 1200_l._

In the pieces of _Bos_, a Flemish painter, the dew was represented so
much like nature, as to deserve universal approbation.Bernazzano painted strawberries on a wall so naturally, that, we are
told, the plaster was torn down by the frequent pecking of peacocks.Amidst these celebrated painters, these admiring judges of nature, let
us not forget our never-dying Hogarth; his piercing eye even discovers
itself in his letter to Mr.Ellis, the naturalist:--"As for your pretty
little seed cups, or vases, they are a sweet confirmation of the
pleasure nature seems to take in superadding an elegance of form to most
of her works, wherever you find them.How poor and bungling are all the
inventions of art!"[48] The very numerous works of this indefatigable writer, embracing so
many subjects, make one think he must have been as careful of his time,
as the celebrated friend of the witty _Boileau_: the humane, benevolent,
and dignified Chancellor _Aguesseau_, who finding that his wife always
kept him waiting an hour after the dinner bell had rung, resolved to
devote this time to writing a work on Jurisprudence.He put this project
in execution, and in the course of time, produced a quarto work in four
thick volumes.[49] This chesnut tree is thus noticed in a newspaper of August,
1829:--"The celebrated chesnut tree, the property of Lord Ducie, at
Tortworth, in the county of Gloucester, is the oldest, if not the
largest tree in England, having this year attained the age of 1002
years, and being 52 feet in circumference, and yet retains so much
vigour, that it bore nuts so lately as two years ago, from which young
trees are now being raised."published in 1717, called the "Lady's Recreation,"
by _Charles_ Evelyn, Esq.There are two letters subjoined, written to
this author by the Rev.From page 103, 105, 129 and 141,
one should think this was not the son of the famous Mr.Lawrence, in the Preface to his Kalendar, inserted at the
end of his fifth edition, assures the public, "that the book called the
Lady's Recreation could not be published by my approbation, because it
was never seen by me till it was in print; besides, I have reason to
think it was an artifice of the booksellers to impose upon the world,
under the borrowed name of Evelyn."[51] This sermon was preached for several years by Dr.Colin Milne, by
whom it was published in 1799, and afterwards by the Rev.Ellis, of
Merchant Taylors' School.Ellis, in his History of Shoreditch, gives
us much information as to this bequest; in which the handsome conduct of
Mr.Denne, a former vicar, is not the least interesting.of his Literary Anecdotes, bears testimony to Dr.Denne's
feeling towards the poor and distressed, and to his attachment to
literary pursuits.Three of these Sermons are in the second volume of
"Thirty Sermons on Moral and Religious Subjects, by the Rev.W. Jones, of Nayland, his Theological, Philosophical,
and Miscellaneous Works, with Life, 12 vols._neat_, 7_l._ 7_s._
6_d._ 1801.William Jones, of Nayland, Suffolk:
Chaplain to the Right Rev.George Horne, Bishop of Norwich; 1 vol.with Portrait of the Author, price 12_s._ Dove, St.John's Square,
Printer, 1828."Of this faithful servant of God, (the Rev.W. Jones) I
can speak both from personal knowledge and from his writings.He was a
man of quick penetration, of extensive learning, and the soundest piety;
and he had, beyond any other man I ever knew, the talent of writing upon
the deepest subjects to the plainest understandings."--_Bishop Horsley's
Charges._ The Rev.Samuel Ayscough, of the British Museum, began, in
1790, to preach this annual sermon, and, I believe, continued it for
fourteen years.Ellis, of _Little Gaddesden_, in his Practical Farmer, 8vo.1732, thus speaks on this subject:--"What a charming sight is a large
tree in blossom, and after that, when loaden with fruit, enough perhaps
to make a hogshead of cyder or perry!A scene of beauty, hopes, and
profit, and all!It may be on less than two feet diameter of ground.And
above all, what matter of contemplation does it afford, when we let our
thoughts descend to a single kernel of an apple or pear?And again, how
heightened, on the beholding so great a bulk raised and preserved, by
Omnipotent Power, from so small a body."[53] The thought of planting the sides of public roads, was first
suggested by the great _Sully_.Weston, in his introduction to these Tracts, seems to have
pleasure in recording the following anecdote of La Quintinye, from
Harte's Essay."The famous La Quintinie, director of the royal gardens
in France, obtained from Louis XIV.an abbacy for his son, in one of the
remote provinces; and going soon afterwards to make the abbot a visit,
(who was not then settled in his apartments) he was entertained and
lodged by a neighbouring gentleman with great friendliness and
hospitality.La Quintinie, as was natural, soon examined the gardens of
his host; he found the situation beautiful, and the soil excellent; but
every thing was rude, savage, and neglected: nature had done much, art
nothing.The guest, delighted with his friendly reception, took leave
with regret, and some months after, sent one of the king's gardeners,
and four under-gardeners, to the gentleman, with strict command to
accept of no gratuity.They took possession of his little inclosure the
moment they arrived, and having digged it many times over, they manured,
replanted it, and left one of their number behind them, as a settled
servant in the family.This young man was soon solicited to assist the
neighbourhood, and filled their kitchen gardens and fruit gardens with
the _best_ productions of every kind, which are preserved and propagated
to this very hour."_Perrault_, in
his _Hommes Illustres_, has given his Life, and Portrait.Gibson, in
his Fruit Gardener, calls him "truly an original author;" and further
pays him high compliments.thus speaks of him:--"Il vint a Paris se faire
recevoir avocat.Une eloquence naturelle, cultivee avec soin, le fit
briller dans le Barreau, et lui consila l'estime des premiers
magistrais.Quoi qu'il eut peu de temps dont il put disposer, il en
trouvoit neanmoins suffisament pour satisfaire la passion qu'il avoit
pour l'agriculture.Il augmenta ses connoissances sur le jardinage, dans
un voyage qu'il fit en Italie.De retour a Paris, il se livra tout
entier a l'agriculture, et fit un grand nombre d'experiences curieuses
et utiles.Le grand Prince de _Conde_, qui aimoit l'agriculture, prenoit
une extreme plaisir a s'entretenir avec lui; et Charles II.Roi
d'Angleterre lui offrit une pension considerable pour l'attacher a la
culture de ses Jardins, mais il refusa ses offres avantageuses par
l'amour qu'il avoit pour sa patrie, et trouva en France les recompenses
due a son merite.On a de lui un excellent livre, intitule 'Instructions
pour les Jardins Fruitiers et Potagers, Paris, 1725, 2 tom._et
plusieurs Lettres sur la meme matiere_."Switzer, in his History of
Gardening, says, that in Mons.de la Quintinye's "Two Voyages into
England, he gained considerable friendship with several lords with whom
he kept correspondence by letters till his death, and these letters,
says Perrault, are all _printed at London_."And he afterwards says,
speaking of Lord Capel's garden at Kew, "the greatest advance made by
him herein, was the bringing over several sorts of fruits from France;
and this noble lord we may suppose to be one that held for many years a
correspondence with Mons.Such letters on such
correspondence if ever printed, must be worth perusal.[55] Lamoignon de Malherbes (that excellent man) had naturalized a vast
number of foreign trees, and at the age of eighty-four, saw every where,
in France, (as Duleuze observes) plants of his own introduction.The old Earl of _Tweedale_, in the reign of Charles II.and his
immediate successor, planted more than six thousand acres, in Scotland,
with fir trees.In a Tour through Scotland, in 1753, it mentions, that
"The county of Aberdeen is noted for its timber, having in it upwards of
five millions of fir trees, besides vast numbers of other kinds, planted
within these seventy years, by the gentry at and about their seats."Marshall, in his "Planting and Rural Ornament," states, that "In
1792, his Grace the Duke of Athol (we speak from the highest authority)
was possessed of a thousand larch trees, then growing on his estates of
Dunkeld and Blair only, of not less than two to four tons of timber
each; and had, at that time, a million larches, of different sizes,
rising rapidly on his estate."The zeal for planting in Scotland, of late years, has been stimulated by
the writings of James Anderson, and Lord Kames.It is pleasing to transcribe the following paragraph from a newspaper of
the year 1819:--"Sir Watkin Williams Wynn has planted, within the last
five years, on the mountainous lands in the vicinity of Llangollen,
situated from 1200 to 1400 feet above the level of the sea, 80,000 oaks,
63,000 Spanish chesnuts, 102,000 spruce firs, 110,000 Scotch firs,
90,000 larches, 30,000 wych elms, 35,000 mountain elms, 80,000 ash, and
40,000 sycamores, all of which are, at this time, in a healthy and
thriving condition."It is impossible, on this subject, to avoid paying
a grateful respect to the memory of that bright ornament of our church,
and literature, the late Dr.Watson, Bishop of Llandaff, whose extensive
plantations, near Ambleside, have long since enriched that part.The
late Richard Crawshay (surpassed by no being during the whole course of
his very long life, for either integrity or generosity) assured the
present writer, that during an early period of Dr.Watson's planting, he
offered him, on the security of his note of hand only, and to be repaid
at his own entire convenience, ten thousand pounds, and that he (with
grateful thanks to Mr.[56] How widely different has the liberal and classic mind of Dr.Alison
viewed the rich pages of Mr.Whateley, in his deep and learned Essays on
Taste, first published nearly twenty years after Mr.One regrets that there is no Portrait of Mr.Alison,
there is a masterly one by Sir Henry Raeburn, admirably engraved by W.
Walker, of Edinburgh, in 1823.Perhaps it is one of the finest Portraits
of the present day.One is happy to perceive marks of health expressed
in his intellectually striking countenance.[57] In Biographical Anecdotes, 3 vols.appears a correspondence in
London, with Dr.Franklin, and William Whateley, and Joseph Whateley, in
1774.Temple, by a brother of Thomas
Whateley.Franklin, it appears, that
inflammatory and ill-judged letters were written by George Hutchinson,
and others, to _Thomas_ Whateley, Esq._private Secretary to Lord
Grenville_, respecting some disturbances in America, concerning Lord
Grenville's Stamp Act.On the death of Thomas, these letters were placed
in the hands of Dr.Franklin, whose duty, as agent to the colony, caused
him to transmit them to Boston.A quarrel arose between William Whateley
and Mr.Temple, as to which of them gave up those letters, and a duel
was fought.Franklin immediately cleared both those gentlemen from
all imputation.Of the celebrated interview in the council chamber,
between Mr.Franklin, an account is given by Dr.page 1. of the Monthly Magazine, and which candid
account entirely acquits Dr.Franklin from having deserved the rancorous
political acrimony of Mr.Wedderburn, whose intemperate language is
fully related in some of the Lives of Dr.Franklin, and in his Life,
published and sold by G. Nicholson, _Stourport_, 12mo.Lord Chatham spoke of Franklin in the highest strain of panegyric, when
adverting, in the year 1777, to his dissuasive arguments against the
American war.William Whateley was administrator of the goods and chattels of his
brother Thomas, who, of course, died without a will.and Political Tracts, the nineteenth
chapter consists of his account of two _Political_ Tracts, by Thomas
Whateley, Esq.and he thus concludes this chapter:--"Mr.Whateley also
wrote a tract on laying out pleasure grounds."is an
account of the quarrel and duel with Mr.It appears that Thomas Whateley died in June, 1772, and left two
brothers, William and Joseph.Debrett published "Scarce Tracts," in 4 vols.i. is one
called "The Budget," by D. Hartley, Esq.This same volume contains a
reply to this, viz."Remarks on the Budget, by Thomas Whateley, Esq.another tract by
Thomas Whateley, Esq.entitled "Considerations on the Trade and Finances
of the Kingdom."These two pamphlets, upon subjects so very different
from the alluring one on landscape gardening, and his unfinished one on
Shakspeare, convinces us, what a powerful writer he would have been, had
his life been longer spared.[58] The reader will be amply gratified by perusing page 158 of the late
Sir U. Price's well known Letter to Mr.Morris's
Observations on Water, as regards Ornamental Scenery; inserted in the
Gardener's Magazine for May, 1827.Whateley's distinction between a
river, a rivulet, and a rill, form, perhaps, five of the most seductive
pages of his book.Our own Shakspeare's imagery on this subject, should
not be overlooked:--

   The current that with gentle murmur glides,
   Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;
   But when his fair course is not hindered,
   He makes sweet music with the enamelled stones,
   Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
   He overtaketh in his pilgrimage:
   And so by many winding nooks he strays
   With willing sport to the wild ocean.[59] The benevolent mind of the marquis shines even in his concluding
chapter; for he there wishes "to bring us back to a true taste for
beautiful nature--to more humane and salutary regulations of the
country--to produce the _moral_ landscapes which delight the mind.His
view of the good mother, seeing her children playing round her at their
cottage, near the common, thus "endearing her home, and making even the
air she breathed more delightful to her, make these sort of commons, to
me, the most delightful of _English gardens_.The dwellings of the happy
and peaceful husbandmen would soon rise up in the midst of compact
farms.Can there exist a more delightful habitation for man, than a neat
farm-house in the centre of a pleasing landscape?There avoiding disease
and lassitude, useless expence, the waste of land in large and dismal
parks, and above all, by preventing misery, and promoting happiness, we
shall indeed have gained the prize of having united the agreeable with
the useful.Perhaps, when every folly is exhausted, there will come a
time, in which men will be so far enlightened as to prefer the real
pleasures of nature to vanity and chimera."[60] Perhaps it may gratify those who seek for health, by their
attachment to gardens, to note the age that some of our English
horticulturists have attained to:--Parkinson died at about 78;
Tradescant, the father, died an old man; Switzer, about 80; Sir Thomas
Browne died at 77; Evelyn, at 86; Dr.Beale, at 80; Jacob Bobart, at 85;
Collinson, at 75; a son of Dr.Lawrence (equally fond of gardens as his
father) at 86; Bishop Compton, at 81; Bridgman, at an advanced age;
Knowlton, gardener to Lord Burlington, at 90; Miller, at 80; James Lee,
at an advanced age; Lord Kames, at 86; Abercrombie, at 80; the Rev.Gilpin, at 80; Duncan, a gardener, upwards of 90; Hunter, who published
_Sylva_, at 86; Speechley, at 86; Horace Walpole, at 80; Mr.Bates, the
celebrated and ancient horticulturist of High Wickham, who died there in
December, 1819, at the great age of 89; Marshall, at an advanced age;
Sir Jos.Banks, at 77; Joseph Cradock, at 85; James Dickson, at 89; Dr.Andrew Duncan, at 83; and Sir U. Price, at 83.Loudon, at page 1063
of his Encyclop.inform us, that a market garden, and nursery, near
Parson's Green, had been, for upwards of two centuries, occupied by a
family of the name of Rench; that one of them (who instituted the first
annual exhibition of flowers) died at the age of ninety-nine years,
having had thirty-three children; and that his son (mentioned by
Collinson, as famous for forest trees) introduced the moss-rose, planted
the elm trees now growing in the Bird-cage Walk, St.James's Park, from
trees reared in his own nursery, married two wives, had thirty-five
children, and died in 1783, in the same room in which he was born, at
the age of a hundred and one years.Reflecting on the great age of some
of the above, reminds me of what a "Journal Encyclopedique" said of
Lestiboudois, another horticulturist and botanist, who died at Lille, at
the age of ninety, and who (for even almost in our ashes _live their
wonted fires_) gave lectures in the very last year of his life."When he
had (says an ancient friend of his) but few hours more to live, he
ordered snow-drops, violets, and crocuses, to be brought to his bed, and
compared them with the figures in Tournefort.His whole existence had
been consecrated to the good of the public, and to the alleviation of
misery; thus he looked forward to his dissolution with a tranquillity of
soul that can only result from a life of rectitude; he never acquired a
fortune; and left no other inheritance to his children, but integrity
and virtue."[61] About eighty years previous to Hyll's Treatise on Bees, Rucellai,
an Italian of distinction, who aspired to a cardinal's hat, and who
laboured with zeal and taste (I am copying from De Sismondi's View of
the Literature of the South of Europe) to render Italian poetry
classical, or a pure imitation of the ancients, published his most
celebrated poem on Bees."It receives (says De Sismondi) a particular
interest from the real fondness which Rucellai seems to have entertained
for these creatures.There is something so sincere in his respect for
their virgin purity, and in his admiration of the order of their
government, that he inspires us with real interest for them.All his
descriptions are full of life and truth."[62] Ben Jonson, in his _Discourses_, gives the following eulogy on this
illustrious author:--"No member of his speech but consisted of his own
graces.His hearers could not cough or look aside from him without loss.He commanded where he spoke, and had his judges angry and pleased at his
devotion: no man had their affections more in his power; the fear of
every man that heard him was, lest he should make an end."Loudon,
when treating on the study of plants, observes, that "This wonderful
philosopher explored and developed the true foundations of human
knowledge, with a sagacity and penetration unparalleled in the history
of mankind."applied to the eight books of Hooker's
Ecclesiastical Polity, may well apply to the writings of Bacon:--"there
is no learning that this man hath not searched into.His books will get
reverence by age, for there is in them such seeds of eternity, that they
will continue till the last fire shall devour all learning."Monsieur
Thomas, in his Eulogy of Descartes, says, "Bacon explored every path of
human knowledge, he sat in judgment on past ages, and anticipated those
that were to come."The reader will be gratified by inspecting the
second volume of Mr.Malone's publication of Aubrey's Letters, in the
Bodleian Library, as well as the richly decorated and entertaining
Beauties of England and Wales, and Pennant's Tour from Chester to
London, for some curious notices of the ancient mansion, garden, and
orchard, at Gorhambury.[63] The reader will be amply gratified by Mr.Johnson's review of the
general state of horticulture at this period, in his History of English
Gardening, and with the zeal with which he records the attachment of
James I. and Charles, to this science; and where, in a subsequent
chapter, he glances on the progress of our Botany, and proudly twines
round the brows of the modest, but immortal, Ray, a most deserved and
generous wreath.[64] I subjoin a few extracts from the first book of his English
Husbandman, 4to.1635:--"A garden is so profitable, necessary, and such
an ornament and grace to every house and housekeeper, that the
dwelling-place is lame and maimed if it want that goodly limbe, and
beauty.I do not wonder either at the worke of art, or nature, when I
behold in a goodly, rich and fertill soyle, a garden adorned with all
the delights and delicacies which are within man's understanding,
because the naturall goodnesse of the earth (which not enduring to bee
idle) will bring forth whatsoever is cast into her; but when I behold
upon a barren, dry, and dejected earth, such as the Peake-hills, where a
man may behold snow all summer, or on the East-mores, whose best herbage
is nothing but mosse, and iron-stone, in such a place, I say, to behold
a delicate, rich, and fruitful garden, it shewes great worthinesse in
the owner, and infinite art and industry in the workeman, and makes mee
both admire and love the begetters of such excellencies."And again,--"For the situation of the garden-plot for pleasure, you
shall understand, that it must ever bee placed so neare unto the
dwelling-house as it is possible, both because the eye of the owner may
be a guard and support from inconveniences, as all that the especial
roomes and prospects of the house may be adorned, perfumed, and inriched
with the delicate proportions, odoriferous smells, and wholesome airs
which shall ascend and vaporate from the same."He then gives a variety of cuts of knots and mazes, and labyrinths, of
which he observes, that "many other adornations and beautifyings there
are, which belong to the setting forth of a curious garden, but for as
much as none are more rare or more esteemed than these I have set down,
being the best ornaments of the best gardens of this kingdome, I think
them tastes sufficient for every husbandman or other of better quality,
which delighteth in the beauty, and well trimming of his ground."He
thus remarks:--"as in the composition of a delicate woman, the grace of
her cheeke is the mixture of red and white, the wonder of her eye blacke
and white, and the beauty of her hand blew and white, any of which is
not said to be beautifull if it consist of single or simple colours; and
so in these walkes or alleyes the all greene, nor the all yellow cannot
be said to bee most beautifull, but the greene and yellow, (that is to
say, the untroade grasse, and the well knit gravell) being equally mixt,
give the eye both luster and delight beyond all comparison."His description of the following flower is singular: "_The Crowne
Emperiall_, is, of all flowers, both forraigne and home-bred, the
delicatest, and strangest: it hath the true shape of an imperiall
crowne, and will be of divers colours, according to the art of the
gardener.In the middest of the flower you shall see a round pearle
stand, in proportion, colour, and orientnesse, like a true naturall
pearle, only it is of a soft liquid substance: this pearle, if you shake
the flower never so violently, will not fall off, neyther if you let it
continue never so long, will it eyther encrease or diminish in the
bignesse, but remaineth all one: yet if with your finger you take and
wipe it away, in less than an hour after you shall have another arise in
the same place, and of the same bignesse.This pearle, if you taste it
upon your tongue, is pleasant, and sweet like honey: this flower when
the sunne ariseth, you shall see it looke directly to the east, with the
stalk bent lowe thereunto, and as the sunne ariseth higher and higher,
so the flower will likewise ascend, and when the sunne is come into the
meridian or noone poynt, which is directly over it, then will it stand
upright upon the stalke, and looke directly upward, and as the sunne
declineth, so will it likewise decline, and at the sunne setting looke
directly to the west only."His mention of another flower is attractive:--"Now for your _Wall
Gilliflower_, it delighteth in hard rubbish, limy, and stony grounds,
whence it commeth they covet most to grow upon walls, pavements, and
such like barraine places.It may be sowen in any moneth or season, for
it is a seed of that hardness, that it makes no difference betwixt
winter and summer, but will flourish in both equally, and beareth his
flowers all the yeere, whence it comes that the husbandman preserves it
most in his _bee-garden_, for it is _wondrous sweet_, and affordeth much
honey.It would be sowen in very small quantity, for after it hath once
taken roote, it will naturally of itself overspread much ground, and
hardly ever after be rooted out.It is of itselfe of so exceeding a
strong, and _sweet smell_, that it cannot be forced to take any other,
and therefore is ever preserved in its owne nature."of Gardening, fondly reviews the taste
for flowers which pervaded most ranks during the time of Elizabeth, and
Evelyn.The _Spectacle de la Nature_, of which we have a translation in 1740,
has a richly diffuse chapter on flowers.I here transcribe a small part
thereof:--

_Prior._ "The beauty of flowers never fails to inspire us with joy; and
when we have sufficiently examined the fairest, we are sensible they are
only proper to refresh the sight; and, indeed, the prospect they afford
is so touching, and we experience their power to be so effectual, that
the generality of those arts which are ambitious to please, seem most
successful when they borrow their assistance.Sculpture imitates them in
its softest ornaments; architecture bestows the embellishments of leaves
and festoons on those columns and fronts, which would otherwise be too
naked.The richest embroideries are little more than foliage and
flowers; the most magnificent silks are almost covered with these
charming forms, and are thought beautiful, in proportion as they
resemble the lively tinge of natural flowers."These have always been the symbols, or representations of joy; they
were formerly the inseparable ornaments of feasts, and are still
introduced with applause, toward the close of our entertainments, when
they are brought in with the fruit, to enliven the festival that begins
to languish.And they are so peculiarly adapted to scenes of pleasure,
that they are always considered as inconsistent with mourning.Decency,
informed by nature, never admits them into those places where tears and
affliction are predominant._Countess._ "The festivals in the country are never celebrated without
garlands, and the entertainments of the polite are ushered in by a
flower.If the winter denies them that gratification, they have recourse
to art.A young bride, in all the magnificence of her nuptial array,
would imagine she wanted a necessary part of her ornaments, if she did
not improve them with a sprig of flowers.A queen, amidst the greatest
solemnities, though she is covered with the jewels of the crown, has an
inclination to this rural ornament; she is not satisfied with mere
grandeur and majesty, but is desirous of assuming an air of softness and
gaiety, by the mediation of flowers._Prior._ "Religion itself, with all its simplicity and abstraction, and
amidst the abhorrence it professes to theatrical pomp, which rather
tends to dissipate the heart, than to inspire it with a due reverence
for sacred mysteries, and a sensibility of human wants, permits some of
its festivals to be celebrated with boughs, and chaplets of flowers."[66] In his Diary is the following entry:--"1658, 27 Jan.After six fits
of an ague, died my son Richard, five years and three days old onely,
but, at that tender age, a prodigy for witt and understanding; for
beauty of body, a very angel; for endowment of mind, of incredible and
rare hopes.He was all life, all prettinesse.What shall I say of his
frequent pathetical ejaculations uttered of himselfe: _Sweete Jesus,
save me, deliver me, pardon my sins, let thine angels receive me!_ So
early knowledge, so much piety and perfection!for such a child I blesse God in whose bosome he is!"Nanteuil's portrait is prefixed to his _Sylva_, 1664; and a fine copy of
the same, by Bartolozzi, is prefixed to Hunter's _Sylva_.Worlidge
engraved a fine portrait of him, prefixed to his _Sculptura_.Gaywood
engraved his portrait for the translation of _Lucretius_.In Walpole's
Anecdotes is his portrait, by Bannerman.[67] In "A Picturesque Promenade round Dorking," are selected many
interesting particulars of Mr.[68] Essex lost his head for having said that Elizabeth grew old and
cankered, and that her mind was as crooked as her carcase.Perhaps the
beauty of Mary galled Elizabeth.The Quarterly Review of July, 1828, thus remarks:--"When Elizabeth's
wrinkles waxed many, it is reported that an unfortunate master of the
Mint incurred disgrace, by a too faithful shilling; the die was broken,
and only one mutilated impression is now in existence.Her maids of
honour took the hint, and were thenceforth careful that no fragment of a
looking glass should remain in any room of the palace.In fact, the
lion-hearted lady had not heart to look herself in the face for the last
twenty years of her life."She loved Essex, of all
men, best; and yet the same axe which murdered Anne Bulleyn, was used to
revenge herself on him.The bloody task took three strokes, which so
enraged the multitude, (who loved Essex) that they would have torn the
executioner to pieces, had not the soldiers prevented them.Hutton,
in his "Journey to London," observes, that "their vengeance ought to
have been directed against the person who caused him to use it."What
her reflections were on these two bloody acts when on her death-bed, we
scarcely know.A modern writer on horticulture, nearly concludes a very
pleasing work, by enumerating (with slight historical notices) the
several plants cultivated in our gardens.He thus concludes his account
of one:--"Queen Elizabeth, in her last illness, eat little but Succory
Pottage."Loudon says it is used "as a fodder for cattle."The
French call it Chicoree _sauvage_.Her taste must have been something
like her heart.Poor Mary eat no supper the night previous to _her_ last
illness.Had it been possible for Elizabeth to have read those pages of
Robertson, which paint the long succession of calamities which befel
Mary, and the insolence and brutality she received from Darnley, and
which so eloquently plead for her frailties, perhaps even these pages
would not have softened her bloody disposition, which she seems to have
inherited from that insolent monster, her father."Mary's sufferings
(says this enchanting historian) exceed, both in degree and duration,
those tragical distresses which fancy has feigned, to excite sorrow and
commiseration; and while we survey them, we are apt altogether to forget
her frailties; we think of her faults with less indignation, and approve
of our tears as if they were shed for a person who had attained much
nearer to pure virtue.With regard to the queen's person, all
contemporary authors agree in ascribing to Mary the utmost beauty of
countenance, and elegance of shape, of which the human form is capable.Her hair was black, though, according to the fashion of that age, she
frequently borrowed locks, and of different colours.Her eyes were a
dark grey; her complexion was exquisitely fine, and her hands and arms
remarkably delicate, both as to shape and colour.Her stature was of an
height that rose to the majestic.She danced, she walked, and she rode
with equal grace.She sung, and played upon the lute with uncommon
skill."[69] I will merely give this brief extract as one out of many of great
force and beauty, from his _Salmonia_:--"If we look with wonder upon the
great remains of human works, such as the columns of Palmyra, broken in
the midst of the desert, the temples of Paestum, beautiful in the decay
of twenty centuries, or the mutilated fragments of Greek sculpture in
the Acropolis of Athens, or in our own Museum, as proofs of the genius
of artists, and power and riches of nations now past away, with how much
deeper feeling of admiration must we consider those grand monuments of
nature, which mark the revolutions of the globe; continents broken into
islands; one land produced, another destroyed; the bottom of the ocean
become a fertile soil; whole races of animals extinct; and the bones and
exuviae of one class covered with the remains of another, and upon the
graves of past generations--the marble or rocky tomb, as it were, of a
former animated world--new generations rising, and order and harmony
established, and a system of life and beauty produced, as it were, out
of chaos and death; proving the infinite power, wisdom, and goodness, of
the GREAT CAUSE OF ALL BEING!"I must trespass on my reader, by again
quoting from _Salmonia_:--"I envy no quality of the mind or intellect in
others; not genius, power, wit, or fancy; but if I could choose what
would be most delightful, and I believe most useful to me, I should
prefer _a firm religious belief_ to every other blessing; for it makes
life a discipline of goodness--creates new hopes, when all earthly hopes
vanish; and throws over the decay, the destruction of existence, the
most gorgeous of lights; awakens life even in death, and from corruption
and decay calls up beauty and divinity: makes an instrument of torture
and of shame the ladder of ascent to Paradise; and, far above all
combinations of earthly hopes, calls up the most delightful visions of
palms and amaranths, the gardens of the blest, the security of
everlasting joys, where the sensualist and the sceptic view only gloom,
decay, annihilation, and despair!"[70] In this delightful essay, he says, "the most exquisite delights of
sense are pursued, in the contrivance and plantation of gardens, which,
with fruits, flowers, shades, fountains, and the music of birds that
frequent such happy places, seem to furnish all the pleasures of the
several senses."Johnson, in his History of English Gardening, admirably
confirms this conflagration argument, by quoting the opinion or
testimony of the celebrated Goethe.[72] To this interesting subject is devoted, a part of Mr.Loudon's
concise and luminous review "Of the Rise, Progress, and Present State of
Gardening in the British Isles;" being chapter iv.[73] Perhaps there are few pages that more awfully paint the sacredness
of this spot, than page 36 in the fifth edition of Dr.[74] I do not mean to apply to the hospitable table of this reverend
gentleman, the lines of Peter Pindar:--

   One cut from _venison_, to the heart can speak,
   Stronger than ten quotations from the _Greek_.[75] I cannot prevent myself from quoting a very small portion of the
animated address of another clergyman, the Rev.J. G. Morris, as
chairman to the Wakefield Horticultural Society.I am certain each one
of my readers will blame me for not having inserted the whole of this
eloquent appeal.I copy it from the Gardener's Magazine for August,
1828:--"Conscious that I possessed no qualifications to fit me for the
task, and feeling that it ill became me to assume it, as I am as yet
nearly a stranger amongst you; aware, too, that I should be surrounded
by individuals so much more eligible, inasmuch as they are eminently
gifted with botanical science and practical knowledge, the result of
their horticultural pursuits and facilities, of which I am quite devoid;
I wished and begged to decline the proffered honour.It appears,
however, that my entreaties are not listened to, and that your kindness
and partiality persist in selecting for your chairman one so inadequate
to the situation.Gentlemen, I take the chair with much diffidence; but
I will presume to say, that, in the absence of other qualities, I bring
with me a passionate love for plants and flowers, for the sweets and
beauties of the garden, and no inconsiderable fondness for its more
substantial productions.Gardening, as a recreation and relaxation from
severer studies and more important avocations, has exquisite charms for
me; and I am ready, with old _Gerarde_, to confess, that 'the principal
delight is in the mind, singularly enriched with the knowledge of these
visible things; setting forth to us the invisible wisdom and admirable
workmanship of Almighty God.'With such predilections, you will easily
give me credit, gentlemen, for participating with this assembly in the
sincerest wishes for the complete and permanent establishment of a
society amongst us, whose object shall be to promote, in the surrounding
district, the introduction of different sorts of flowers, culinary
vegetables, fruits, improved culture and management generally, and _a
taste_ for botany as a science.These are pursuits, gentlemen, combining
at once health and innocence, pleasure and utility.Wakefield and its
vicinity appear to possess facilities for the accomplishment of such a
project, inferior to no district within this great palatinate, indeed,
little inferior to any in the kingdom.The country is beautiful and
charmingly varied, and, from the diversity of soil, suited to varied
productions; the whole thickly interspersed with seats and villas of
persons of opulence, possessing their conservatories, hot-houses, and
stoves, their orchards, flower and kitchen gardens: whilst few towns can
boast (as Wakefield can) of so many gardens within its enclosure,
cultivated with so much assiduity and skill, so much taste and deserved
success.Seven years ago, I had the honour to originate a similar
project in Preston, in Lancashire, and with the happiest success.In
that borough, possessing far less advantages than Wakefield offers, a
horticultural society was established, which, in its four annual
meetings, assembles all the rank and fashion of a circuit of more than
ten miles, and numbers more than a hundred and twenty subscribers to its
funds.Those who have not witnessed the interesting sight, can form but
a faint idea of the animating scene which is presented in a spacious and
handsome room, tastefully adorned with the choicest exotics from various
conservatories, and the more choice, because selected with a view to
competition: decorated with the varied beauties of the parterre, vieing
with each other in fragrance, hue, and delicacy of texture; whilst the
tables groan under the weight of delicious fruits and rare vegetables in
endless variety, the joint produce of hot-houses, stoves, orchards, and
kitchen gardens.Figure to yourselves, gentlemen, this elysium, graced
by some hundreds of our fair countrywomen, an absolute galaxy of
animated beauty, and that music lends its aid, and you will agree with
me that a more fascinating treat could hardly be devised.New flowers,
new fruits, recent varieties of those of long standing and established
character for excellence, are thus introduced, in lieu of those whose
inferiority is no longer doubtful.New culinary vegetables, or, from
superior treatment or mode of culture, rendered more salubrious and of
exquisite flavour, will load the stalls of our market-gardeners.I call
upon you, then, gentlemen, for your zealous support.Say not that you
have no gardens, or that your gardens are inconsiderable, or that you
are no cultivators; you are all interested in having good and delicious
fruits, nutritious and delicate culinary vegetables, and in procuring
them at a reasonable rate, which will be the results of improved and
successful cultivation.At our various exhibitions, let each contribute
that in which he excels, and our object will be attained.Gentlemen, I
fear I have trespassed too long on your patience and indulgence.I will
just urge one more motive for your warm support of our intended society;
it is this: that, by diffusing a love of plants and gardening, you will
materially contribute to the comfort and happiness of the laborious
classes; for the pleasure taken in such pursuits forms an
unexceptionable relaxation from the toils of business, and every hour
thus spent is subtracted from the ale-house and other haunts of idleness
and dissipation."[76] In the grounds of _Hagley_, were once inscribed these lines:--

   Here Pope!--ah, never must that tow'ring mind
   To his loved haunts, or dearer friend return;
   What art, what friendships!what fame resign'd:
   In yonder glade I trace his mournful urn.[77] At Holm-Lacey is preserved a sketch, in crayons, by Pope, (when on
a visit there) of Lord Strafford by Vandyke.It is well known that Pope
painted Betterton in oil colours, and gave it to Lord Mansfield.The
noble lord regretted the loss of this memorial, when his house was
consumed at the time of the disgraceful and ignorant riots.[78] Sir Joshua Reynolds used to tell the following anecdote relative to
Pope.--"When Reynolds was a young man, he was present at an auction of
very scarce pictures, which attracted a great crowd of _connoisseurs_
and others; when, in the moment of a very interesting piece being put
up, Mr.All was in an instant, from a scene of
confusion and bustle, a dead calm.The auctioneer, as if by instinct,
suspended his hammer.The audience, to an individual, as if by the same
impulse, rose up to receive the poet; and did not resume their seats
till he had reached the upper end of the room."A similar honour was paid to the Abbe Raynal, whose reputation was such,
that the Speaker of the House of Commons observing _him_ among the
spectators, suspended the business of the house till he had seen the
eloquent historian placed in a more commodious seat.It is painful to
relate, that this powerful writer, and good man, who narrowly escaped
the guillotine, expired in a garret, in extreme poverty, at the age of
eighty-four; the only property he left being one assignat of fifty
livres, worth not threepence in ready money.Perhaps one might have
applied the following anecdote (told by Dr.Drake in his Literary Hours)
to Abbe Raynal:--"A respectable character, having long figured in the
gay world at Paris, was at length compelled to live in an obscure
retreat in that city, the victim of severe misfortunes.He was so
indigent, that he subsisted only on an allowance from the parish.Every
week bread was sent to him sufficient for his support, and yet at
length, he demanded more.'With whom, sir, is it possible I should live?I am wretched, since I thus solicit charity, and am abandoned by all the
world.''But, sir, if you live alone, why do you ask for more bread than
is sufficient for yourself?'The other at last, with great reluctance,
confessed that he had a dog.The curate desired him to observe, that he
was only the distributor of the bread that belonged to the poor, and
that it was absolutely necessary that he should dispose of his dog.exclaimed the poor man, weeping, 'and if I lose my dog, who is
there then to love me?'The good pastor took his purse, and giving it to
him, 'take this, sir,' said he; 'this is mine--this I _can_ give.'"[79] How applicable are Gray's lines to Lord Byron himself, now!Can storied urn or animated bust
     Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?Can honour's voice provoke the silent dust,
     Or flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of death?Perhaps in this _neglected_ spot is laid
     Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire!--



[80] Mr.Bowles, in some stanzas written since the death of Byron, thus
feelingly apostrophizes his noble spirit:--

   But I will bid th' Arcadian cypress wave,
     Pluck the green laurel from Peneus' side,
   And pray thy spirit may such quiet have
     That not one thought unkind be murmur'd o'er thy grave.[81] Perhaps one motive (no doubt there were numberless others) that
_might_ have induced Mr.Mason thus to honour the memory of Pope,

   ----_letting cold tears bedew his silver urn_,

_might_ have been from the recollection of his attachment to what
equally charmed Mr.[82] I know not whether Milton's portrait should have been here noticed.In a note to the eloquent, the talented, and graceful "Discours
d'Installation, prononce par M. le Vicomte H. de Thury, president de la
Societe d'Horticulture de Paris," it is beautifully observed, that
"Personne n'a mieux decrit ce delicieux jardin que Milton.Les Anglais
regardent comme le type de tous les jardins paysagers, et pittoresques,
la description que fait Milton du jardin d'Eden, et qui atteste que se
sublime genie etoit egalement poete, peintre et paysagiste."As I have
sought for the portraits of Mr.Whateley, and
have noticed those of Launcelot Brown, and Mr.Cradock, M.
R. P. Knight and Sir U. Price, who were all _paysagists_; surely our
great and severe republican was one.The Prince de Ligne speaks thus of Milton:--"les vers enchanteurs de ce
Roi des poetes, et des _jardiniers_.I do not know that every one will agree with Switzer in the concluding
part of what he says of Milton, in the History of Gardening, prefixed to
his Iconologia:--"But although things were in this terrible combustion,
we must not omit the famous Mr.John Milton, one of Cromwell's
Secretaries; who, by his excellent and never-to-be-equalled poem of
Paradise Lost, has particularly distinguished gardening, by taking that
for his theme; and shows, that though his eyes deprived him of the
benefit of seeing, yet his mind was wonderfully moved with the
philosophy, innocence, and beauty of this employ; his books, though
mixed with other subjects, being a kind of a philosophical body of
gardening, as well as divinity._had his pen been employed on
no other subject_."It must be needless reminding my reader, that Mr.Walpole's powerful pen
has taken care that our mighty poet, (who "on evil days, though fallen,
and with darkness and solitude compassed round,") shall not be
_defrauded of half his glory_.It is gratifying to remark, that an edition of Paradise Lost is now
announced for publication, in which the zeal of its spirited proprietors
has determined, that every word shall be printed in letters of gold.The
sanction of some of our most distinguished divines, and men of high
rank, evince the pride with which we all acknowledge the devout zeal and
mighty powers of the blind poet.Garrick's fondness for ornamental gardening, induced him finely
to catch at this invention, in his inimitable performance of Lord
Chalkstone.Pulteney relates this anecdote of Mr.Miller: "He was the only
person I ever knew who remembered to have seen Mr.I shall not
easily forget the pleasure that enlightened his countenance, it so
strongly expressed the _Virgilium tantum vidi_, when, in speaking of
that revered man, he related to me that incident of his youth."Ray only meditated a work to have been entitled _Horti_ Angliae.Had he written it, I should have felt a singular pride in introducing
his valued name in the present imperfect volume.[85] The generous minded reader will be gratified by referring to the
kind tribute, paid to the memory of Shenstone, by Mr.Johnson, in his History
of Gardening, thus speaks:--"Taken as a whole, it is the most complete
book of gardening ever published;"--and that, with the exception of
chymistry, "every art and science, at all illustrative of gardening, are
made to contribute their assistance."[86] In his "Unconnected Thoughts" he admires the _Oak_, for "its
majestic appearance, the rough grandeur of its bark, and the wide
protection of its branches: a large, branching, aged oak, is, perhaps,
the most venerable of all inanimate objects."[87] Tea was the favourite beverage of Dr.When Hanway
pronounced his anathema against it, Johnson rose in defence of it,
declaring himself "in that article a hardened sinner, having for years
diluted my meals with the infusion of that fascinating plant; my
tea-kettle has had no time to cool; with tea I have solaced the midnight
hour, and with tea welcomed the morning."Pennant was a great lover
of tea; a hardy honest Welch parson, on hearing that he usually retired
in the afternoon to his summer-house to enjoy that beverage, was moved
with indignation, that any thing weaker than ale or wine should be drunk
there; and calling to mind the good hunting times of old, passionately
exclaimed, "his father would have scorned it."[88] Sir Uvedale thus expresses his own sensations when viewing some of
these plantations:--"The inside fully answers to the dreary appearance
of the outside; of all dismal scenes it seems to me the most likely for
a man to hang himself in; he would, however, find some difficulty in the
execution, for amidst the endless multitude of stems, there is rarely a
single side branch to which a rope could be fastened.The whole wood is
a collection of tall naked poles.... Even its gloom is without
solemnity; it is only dull and dismal; and what light there is, like
that of hell,

   _Serves only to discover scenes of woe,
   Regions of sorrow, doleful shades._"



[89] This observation confirms what Sir U. Price so pointedly enforces
throughout the whole of his causticly sportive letter to Mr.Repton:
"that the best landscape painters would be the best landscape gardeners,
were they to turn their minds to the practical part; consequently, a
study of their works, the most useful study to an improver."--And that
"Van Huysum would be a much better judge of the merits and defects of
the most dressed scene--of a mere flower garden,--than a gardener."Browne was not an author; yet the title of the present volume
is "On the Portraits of English _Authors_ on Gardening."Neither was old
Bridgman nor Kent _authors_ on this subject; still I could not prevail
on myself to pass over such names in total silence.Clive resided at Moreton-Say, near Market-Drayton.He was a
prebend of Westminster.In
his village, scarcely a poor man existed.His kindness and benevolence
to the poor, could only be equalled by his friendly hospitality and kind
feeling to the more affluent in his neighbourhood:

   _Thy works, and alms, and all thy good endeavour,
   Follow thee up to joy and bliss for ever._

Miss Seward thus concludes one of her letters to him:--"I wish none were
permitted to enter the lists of criticism but those who feel poetic
beauty as keenly as yourself, and who have the same generous desire that
others should feel it."Clive with gratitude, from a
recollection of kindnesses received from him at a very early period of
my life, and which were of such a nature, as could not fail to animate
the mind of a young man to studious exertions.Archdeacon Plimley (now
the truly venerable Archdeacon Corbet, and who has been so long an
honour to his native county), in his Agricultural Survey of Shropshire,
respectfully introduces Mr.Clive's name; and when he addressed his
charge to the diocese of Hereford, in 1793, one really cannot but apply
to Mr.Clive, what he so eloquently enforces in that charge to each
clergyman:--"to cultivate a pure spirit within their own bosoms; to be
in every instance the right-hand neighbour to each parishioner; their
private adviser, their public monitor, their example in christian
conduct, their joy in health, their consolation in sickness."Archdeacon Clive, lies buried Robert Lord Clive,
conqueror of _Plassy_: on whose death appeared these extempore lines, by
a man of distinction, a friend to Lord Clive:--

   Life's a surface, slippery, glassy,
   Whereon tumbled Clive of Plassy;
   All the wealth the east could give,
   Brib'd not death to let him live:
   There's no distinction in the grave
   'Twixt the nabob and the slave.His lordship's death, in 1774, was owing to the same cause which
hastened that of the most worthy of men, Sir Samuel Romilly--from
shattered and worn out nerves;--from severe study in the latter, and
from the burning climate of the east in the former.Had Lord Clive lived
a few years longer, he would have enriched the whole neighbourhood round
his native spot.His vigorous, ardently-gifted, and penetrating mind,
projected plantations and other improvements, that could only have been
conceived by such minds as Olivier de Serres, or by Sully, or by our own
Evelyn.He was generous, social and
friendly; and if ever charity to the poor warmed the breast of any
mortal, it warmed that of Lord Clive.Few men had more kind affections
than Lord Clive.[92] The following passage from a favourite book of Dr.Darwin's, (the
System of Nature, by Linnaeus) will well apply to that searching and
penetrating mind, which so strongly possessed him through life.--"How
small a part of the great works of nature is laid open to our eyes, and
how many things are going on in secret which we know nothing of!How
many things are there which this age first was acquainted with!How many
things that we are ignorant of will come to light when all memory of us
shall be no more!for nature does not at once reveal all her secrets.We
are apt to look on ourselves as already admitted into the sanctuary of
her temple; we are still only in the porch."How full of grace, of
tenderness, and passion, is that elegy, which he composed the night he
feared a life he so passionately loved (Mrs.Pole, of Radburn,) was in
imminent danger, and when he dreamed she was dead:

   Stretch'd on her sable bier, the grave beside,
     A snow-white shroud her breathless bosom bound,
   O'er her white brow the _mimic lace_ was tied,
     And loves, and virtues, hung their garlands round.From these cold lips did softest accents flow?Round that pale mouth did sweetest dimples play?On this dull cheek the rose of beauty blow,
     And those dim eyes diffuse celestial rays?Did this cold hand unasking want relieve,
     Or wake the lyre to every rapturous sound?How sad, for other's woes, this breast could heave!How light this heart, for other's transport, bound![93] It was at this period of his residence at Lichfield, that the
present writer heard him strongly enforce the cultivation of _papaver
somniferum_.What he may have also enforced to others, may possibly have
given rise to some of those ingenious papers on its cultivation, which
are inserted not only in the Transactions of the Society for the
Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce; in other publications,
but in the first and fifth volumes of the Memoirs of the Caledonian
Horticultural Society.Jones, on its
cultivation, in the former of these transactions, are particularly
diffuse and valuable.The subjoined plate is a copy of that in the title page to
"_Opiologia_, ou traicte concernant le naturel proprietes, vraye
preparation, et seur vsage de l'opium," a favourite volume with Dr.Darwin, printed at _la Haye_, 1614, 12mo.Darwin, in his Botanical
Garden, thus speaks of opium: "the finest opium is procured by wounding
the heads of large poppies with a three-edged knife, and tying
muscle-shells to them, to catch the drops.In small quantities it
exhilirates the mind, raises the passions, and invigorates the body; in
large ones, it is succeeded by intoxication, languor, stupor, and
death."[94] _Sterne_ mentions a traveller who always set out with the spleen
and jaundice,--"without one generous connection, or pleasurable anecdote
to tell of,--travelling straight on, looking neither to his right hand
or his left, lest love or pity should seduce him out of the road."Loudon seems to be a very different kind of a traveller: for his
horticultural spirit and benevolent views, pervade almost every page of
his late tour through _Bavaria_.One envies his feelings, too, in
another rural excursion, through the romantic scenery of _Bury_, at Mr.Hope's at _Deepdene_; and particularly when he
paints his own emotions on viewing the room of sculpture there.He even
could not, in October last, take his rural ride from _Edgware_ to _St.Alban's_ without thus awakening in each traveller a love of gardens, and
giving this gentle hint to an honest landlord:--"A new inn, in the
outskirts of _St.Alban's_, in the _Dunstable_ road, has an ample
garden, not made the most of.Such a piece of ground, and a gardener of
taste, would give an inn, so situated, so great a superiority, that
_every one would be tempted to stop there_; but the garden of this
Boniface, exhibits but the beginning of a good idea."When travelling
along our English roads, his mind no doubt frequently reverts to those
road-side gardens in the Netherlands, which he thus happily adverts to
in p.32 of his Encyclopaedia: "The gardens of the cottagers in these
countries, are undoubtedly better managed and more productive than those
of any other country; no man who has a cottage is without a garden
attached; often small, but rendered useful to a poor family, by the high
degree of culture given to it."Linnaeus, in his eloquent oration at
Upsal, enforces the pleasure of travelling in one's own country, through
its fields _and roads_.Heath, the zealous and affectionate
historian of Monmouth, in his account of that town and its romantic
neighbourhood, (published in 1804,) omits no opportunity of noticing the
many neat gardens, which add to the other rural charms of its rich
scenery, thus mentions another Boniface:--"The late Thomas Moxley, who
kept the public-house at Manson Cross, was a person that took great
delight in fruit-trees, and had a large piece of ground let him, for the
purpose of planting it with apple-trees; but his death (which followed
soon after) prevented the plan from being carried to the extent he
intended, though some of the land bears evidence of his zeal and
labour."Heath cannot even travel on the turnpike road, from
Monmouth to Hereford, without benevolently remarking, that "a number of
laborious families have erected small tenements, with a garden to each,
most of which are thickly planted with apple-trees, whose produce
considerably adds to the owner's support."[95] Of this celebrated biographer of Dr.Darwin (whose Verses to the
Memory of Mr.Garrick, and whose Monody on Captain Cook, will live as
long as our language is spoken,) Sir W. Scott thus describes his first
personal interview with:--"Miss Seward, when young, must have been
exquisitely beautiful; for, in advanced age, the regularity of her
features, the fire and expression of her countenance, gave her the
appearance of beauty, and almost of youth.Her eyes were auburn, of the
precise shade and hue of her hair, and possessed great expression.In
reciting, or in speaking with animation, they appeared to become darker;
and, as it were, to flash fire.I should have hesitated to state the
impression which this peculiarity made upon me at the time, had not my
observation been confirmed by that of the first actress of this or any
other age, with whom I lately happened to converse on our deceased
friend's expressive powers of countenance."[96] From one of these pleasing sermons I extract these few
lines:--"Among the most pleasing sights of a country village, is that of
a father and mother, followed by their family of different ages, issuing
from their little dwelling on a Sunday morning, as the bell tolls to
church.The children, with their ruddy, wholesome looks, are all neat
and clean.Their behaviour at church shews what an impression their
parents have given them of the holiness of the place, and of the duties
they have to perform.Though unregarded, as they return home, by their
richer neighbours, they carry back with them to their humble cottage the
blessing of God.--Pious parents!lead on your children from church to
heaven.an account of
some of the most remarkable places in North Wales.de Voltaire was so charmed with the taste and talents, and
polite engaging manners of La Fage, that he paid him the following
compliment; which may very justly be applied to Mr.Cradock:

   _Il recut deux presens des Dieux,
   Les plus charmans qu'ils puissent faire;
   L'un etoit le talent de plaire,
   L'autre le secret d'etre heureux._



[99] The Quarterly Review for April, 1821, observes, that "The total
number of exotics, introduced into this country, appears to be 11,970,
of which the first forty-seven species, including the orange, apricot,
pomegranate, &c. were introduced previously or during the reign of Henry
VIII., and no fewer than 6756 in the reign of George III.For this proud
accession to our exotic botany in the last century, the public are
chiefly indebted to Sir Joseph Banks, and Messrs.Lee and Kennedy, of
the Hammersmith nursery."[100] The invocation to this Vale, reminds one of Mr.Repton's
description:--"Downton Vale, near Ludlow, one of the most beautiful and
romantic valleys that the imagination can conceive.It is impossible by
description to convey an idea of its natural charms, or to do justice to
that taste which has displayed these charms to the greatest advantage,

   _With art clandestine, and conceal'd design._

A narrow, wild, and natural path, sometimes creeps under the beetling
rock, close by the margin of a mountain stream.It sometimes ascends to
an awful precipice, from whence the foaming waters are heard roaring in
the dark abyss below, or seen wildly dashing against its opposite banks;
while, in other places, the course of the river _Teme_ being impeded by
natural ledges of rock, the vale presents a calm, glassy mirror, that
reflects the surrounding foliage.The path, in various places, crosses
the water by bridges of the most romantic and contrasted forms; and,
branching in various directions, including some miles in length, is
occasionally varied and enriched by caves and cells, hovels, and covered
seats, or other buildings, in perfect harmony with the wild but pleasing
horrors of the scene."[101] Foxley, this far-famed seat of dignified and benevolent
retirement, has on many occasions become interesting.It gave a peaceful asylum to Benjamin Stillingfleet, when
his mind was depressed by disappointment.The then owner, Robert Price,
Esq.and his mild and amiable lady, both kindly pressed him to become an
inmate of their domestic retreat, that his health might be restored, and
his mind calmed; and though he modestly refused being a constant
intruder, yet he took up his residence in a cottage near them, and
delighted to pass his leisure hours in their happy domestic circle,
"blending his studious pursuits, with rural occupations," and
particularly with gardening.No doubt, to this protecting kindness, may,
on this spot, have been imbibed his great veneration for Theophrastus;
and here he must have laid the foundation of those attainments, which,
during the future periods of his life, obtained for him the high
approbation of the justly celebrated Mrs.Montagu, who, in her letters,
speaks of "this invaluable friend," in the highest possible terms of
praise.In this peaceful and consoling retreat, was written his original
and masterly tribute to the talents of Xenophon; and here was first
kindled his deep enthusiastic zeal for the classic authors of antiquity;
and the materials for his then intended edition of Milton (who he says
equalled all the ancients whom he imitated; the sublimity of Homer, the
majesty of Sophocles, the softness of Theocritus, and the gaiety of
Anacreon,) enriched with parallel passages from holy writ, the classics,
and the early Italian poets; and here he composed his matchless treatise
on the power and principles of Tartini's music (for it seems Mr.Price
himself "was a master of the art.")Here too, most probably, he
sketched, or first gathered, his early memoranda towards his future
general history of husbandry, from the earliest ages of the world to his
own time; and fostered a devoted zeal for Linnaeus, which produced that
spirited eulogium on him, which pervades the preface to his translation
of "Miscellaneous Tracts on Natural History."[102] Sir Uvedale, about fifty years ago, translated _Pausanias_ from
the Greek.One may judge of the feeling with which he dwelt on the pages
of this book, by what he says of that nation in vol.65 of his
Essays, where he speaks of being struck with the extreme richness of
some of the windows of our cathedrals and ruined abbeys: "I hope it will
not be supposed, that by admiring the picturesque circumstances of the
Gothic, I mean to undervalue the symmetry and beauty of Grecian
buildings: whatever comes to us from the Greeks, has an irresistible
claim to our admiration; that distinguished people seized on the true
points both of beauty and grandeur in all the arts, and their
architecture has justly obtained the same high pre-eminence as their
sculpture, poetry, and eloquence."[103] On the pomp of devotion in our ancient abbeys, Mr.R. P. Knight
thus interests his readers, in the chapter "Of the Sublime and
Pathetic," in the Inquiry into the principles of Taste:--"Every person
who has attended the celebration of high mass, at any considerable
ecclesiastical establishment, must have felt how much the splendour and
magnificence of the Roman Catholic worship tends to exalt the spirit of
devotion, and to inspire the soul with rapture and enthusiasm.Not only
the impressive melody of the vocal and instrumental music, and the
imposing solemnity of the ceremonies, but the pomp and brilliancy of the
sacerdotal garments, and the rich and costly decorations of the altar,
raise the character of religion, and give it an air of dignity and
majesty unknown to any of the reformed churches."he thus adverts to the effects of
the levelling system of Launcelot Browne:--"From this influence of
fashion, and the particular influence of Mr.Browne, models of old
gardens are in this country still scarcer in nature than in painting;
and therefore what good parts there may be in such gardens, whether
proceeding from original design, or from the changes produced by time
and accident, can no longer be observed; and yet, from these specimens
of ancient art, however they may be condemned as old fashioned, many
hints might certainly be taken, and blended with such modern
improvements as really deserve the name."--"Were my arguments in favour
of many parts of the old style of gardening ever so convincing, the most
I could hope from them at present, would be, to produce _some caution_;
and to assist in preserving some of the few remains of old magnificence
that still exist, by making the owner less ready to listen to a
professor, whose interest it is to recommend total demolition."R.
P. Knight, in a note to his _landscape_, thus remarks on this subject:
"I remember a country clock-maker, who being employed to clean a more
complex machine than he had been accustomed to, very confidently took it
to pieces; but finding, when he came to put it together again, some
wheels of which he could not discover the use, very discreetly carried
them off in his pocket.The simple artifice of this prudent mechanic,
always recurs to my mind, when I observe the manner in which our modern
improvers repair and embellish old places; not knowing how to employ the
terraces, mounds, avenues, and other features which they find there,
they take them all away, and cover the places which they occupied with
turf.It is a short and easy method of proceeding; and if their
employers will be satisfied with it, they are not to be blamed for
persevering in it, as it may be executed by proxy, as well as in
person."Severely (and no doubt justly), as the too generally smooth and
monotonous system of Mr.Browne has been condemned, yet he must have had
great merit to have obtained the many encomiums he did obtain from some
of our first nobility and gentry.The _evil_ which he did in many of
their altered pleasure-grounds, _lives after him--the good is oft
interred in his grave_.George Mason justly observes that "Nature's favourite haunts
are the school of gardening."Chrysostom said of Xenophon, that "he had something of
witchcraft in his writings."It would not be too much to say the same of
this poet.I believe thousands
of men in professional life to-day, who are known as dollar-chasers,
really long for a more simple life, but the disease they have has robbed
them of the power to choose "that better part."And that disease is not
money madness, but _failurephobia_.The fear of failing, or of being called a failure, dominates the
professional world as no other power could.It claims thousands of poor
fellows who were brought up to the active, worth-while life of the farm or
of a trade, and chains them to a miserable, sham, death-in-life sort of
existence, that they come to loathe, but dare not leave because of their
disease, failurephobia.Succeed in your business or profession,
by honest means if you can, but _succeed_!At least, keep up the
appearance of succeeding, and you may keep your place in society.It may
be known that your business is poor, and that you go to your office and
sit in solitude day in and day out, and that you starve and skimp at home,
but so long as you keep up the _show_, you are a "professional man!"What
mighty courage it takes to acknowledge what everybody else knows, and
_quit_!A writer in a medical journal told of a young physician in Boston
who put an ad.in a daily paper asking for a job in which a strong man
could use the strength a manly man ought to be proud of, to earn an honest
living.If men only had the courage, I wonder how many such ads.would
appear in the columns of our papers!An old schoolmate, who is a lawyer in a Western city, told me that of the
more than two hundred lawyers of that city, twenty had practically all the
law business, and of that twenty a half dozen got the big cases in which
there was most money.It is largely so in every city and town.And what
applies to the lawyer applies to the physician, though perhaps not to so
great an extent.And while the fortunate few get most of the practice,
and make most of the money, what are the unfortunate many doing?Holding
on, starving, skimping, keeping up appearances, and, while young, hoping
against hope for better days.But when hope long deferred has made the
soul sick, and hope itself dies, what then?Keep up appearances, you are a
professional man.It would be humorous, were it
not so pathetic, to see the old doctor who has dragged along for years,
barely eking out a living, put on the silk hat of his more ambitious days
and wear it with dignity along with his shiny threadbare trousers and
short coat, making a desperate spurt to keep up with the dashing young
fellow just out of school._Failurephobia!_ Among professional men what a terrible disease it is!I
have known it to drive a young man, who might have been happy and useful
as a farmer or mechanic, into a suicide's grave.Who are the M.D.s whose pictures and glaring ads.appear in
those 15-cent papers published in Augusta, Me., and in many daily and even
religious papers?Are they men who took to graft and disgraced their
profession because they loved that kind of life, and the stigma it brings?Most of them perhaps come from the ranks of ambitious
fellows who lost out in the strife for legitimate practice, but who would
not acknowledge failure, so launched into quackery, and became _notorious_
if they could not become noted.Strange as it may seem, the fact that a professional man is a notorious
grafter abroad does not necessarily deprive him of social standing at
home.I have in mind a man whose smug face appears in connection with a
page of loud and lurid literature in almost every 15-cent _Grafters
Herald_ from Maine to California; yet this man at home was pointed to with
pride as an eminently successful man.He wore his silk hat to church, and
the church of which he was a valued member was proud of the distinction he
gave it.A Western city has an industry to which it "points with pride,"
and the pictures of the huge plant appear conspicuously placed in
illustrated boom editions of the city's enterprising papers.This octopus
reaches out its slimy tentacles to every corner of the United States,
feeling for poor wretches smitten by disease, real or fancied.When once
it gets hold of them it spews its inky fluids around them until they
"cough up" their hard-earned dollars that go to perpetuate this "pride of
the West."The most popular themes of the preacher, lecturer and magazine writer
to-day are Honesty, Anti-graft, Tainted Money, True Success, etc.You have
heard and read them all, and have been thrilled with the stirring words
"An honest man is the noblest work of God."The preacher and the people
think they are sincere, and go home congratulating themselves that they
are capable of entertaining such sentiment.When we observe their social
lives we are led to wonder how much of that noble sentiment is only cant
after all.The world will say that goodness is the only thing worth while,
  But the man who's been successful is the man who gets the smile.If the "good" man is a failure, a fellow who is down,
  He's a fellow "up against it," and gets nothing but a frown.The fellow who is frosted is the fellow who is down,
  No matter how he came there, how honest he has been,
  They find him just the same when being there's a sin.A man is scarce insulted if you tell him he is bad,
  To tell him he is tricky will never make him mad;
  If you say that he's a schemer the world will say he's smart,
  But say that he's a failure if you want to break his heart.If you want to be "respected" and "pointed to with pride,"
  "Air" yourselves in "autos" when you go to take a ride;
  No matter how you get them, with the world that "cuts no ice,"
  Your neighbors know you have them and know they're new and nice.The preacher in the pulpit will tell you, with a sigh,
  That rich men go with Dives when they come at last to die;
  And men who've been like Lazarus, failures here on earth,
  Will find their home in Heaven where the angels know their worth.But the preacher goes with Dives when the dinner hour comes;
  He prefers a groaning table to grabbing after crumbs.Yes; he'll take Dives' "tainted money" just to lighten up his load.Enough to let him travel in the little camel road.That may sound like the wail of a pessimistic knocker, but every observing
man knows it's mostly truth.The successful man is the man who gets the
world's smile, and he gets the smile with little regard to the methods
employed to achieve his "success."This deplorable social condition is largely responsible for the
multitudinous forms of graft that exist to-day.To "cut any ice" in
"society" you must be somebody or keep up the appearance of being
somebody.Even if the world knows you are going mainly on pretensions, it
will "wink the other eye" and give you the place your pretensions claim.Most of the folk who make up "society" are slow to engage in stone
slinging, for they are wise enough to consider the material of which their
own domiciles are constructed.To make an application of all this, let us not be too hard on the quack
and the shyster.He is largely a product of our social system.Society has
placed temptations before him to get money, and he must keep up the
appearances of success at any cost of honesty and independent manhood.The
poor professional man who is a victim of that fearful disease,
failurephobia, in his weakness has become a slave to public opinion.He is
made to "tread the mill" daily in the monotonous round to and from his
office where he is serving a life sentence of solitary confinement, while
his wife sews or makes lace or gives music lessons to support the family.I say solitary confinement advisedly, for now a professional man is even
denied the solid comfort of the old-time village doctor or lawyer who
could sit with his cronies and fellow-loafers in the shade of the tavern
elm, or around the grocer's stove, and maintain his professional standing
(or rather sitting).In the large towns and cities that will not do
to-day.If the professional man is not busy, he must _seem_ busy.A
physician changed his office to get a south front, as he felt he _must_
have sunshine, and he dared not do like Dr.Jones, get it loafing on the
streets.Not that a doctor would not enjoy spending some of his long,
lonely hours talking with his friends in the glorious sunshine, but it
would not do.People would say: "Doctor Blank must not get much to do now.I see him loafing on the street like old Doc Jones.I guess Doctor
Newcomer has made a 'has been' of him, too."I know a young lawyer who sat in his office for two long years without a
single case.Yet every day he passed through the street with the brisk
walk of one in a hurry to get back to pressing business.that he had to read the paper as he walked to save time to--wait!Did you ever sit in the office with one of these prisoners and watch him
looking out of his window upon prosperous farmers as they untied fine
teams and drove away in comfortable carriages?Did you know how to
translate that look in his eye, and the sad abstraction of manner into
which he momentarily sank, in spite of his creed, which taught him to
always seem prosperous and contented?His
mind was following that farmer out of town and along the green lanes,
bordered by meadows and clover bloom, and on down the road through the
cool twilight of the quiet summer evening, to where the ribbon of dark
green forest, whose cool cadence had called to him so often, changed to
groves of whispering trees that bordered the winding stream that spoke of
the swimming holes and fishing pools of his boyhood.And on up the road
again, across the fertile prairie lands, until he turns in at the gate of
an orchard-embowered home.And do you think the picture is less attractive
to this exile because it has not the stately front and the glistening
paint of the smart house in town?The smart house with
glistening paint is the one he must aspire to in town, but his ideal home
is that snug farmhouse to which his fancy has followed the prosperous
farmer.That picture is not altogether a product of poetic fancy.We get glimpses
of such pictures in confidential talks with lawyers and doctors in almost
every town.These poor fellows may fret and sigh for change, "and spend
their lives for naught," but the hunger never leaves them.Not long ago a
professional man who has spent twenty-five years of his life imprisoned in
an office, most of the time just waiting, spoke to me of his longing to
"get out."He forgot the creed,
to always appear prosperous, and spoke in bitterness of his life of sham.He said he was like the general of the old rhyme who "marched up the hill
and--marched down again."He went up to his office and--went home again,
day in and day out, year in and year out, and for what?But
_failurephobia_ held him there, and he is there yet.What schemes such unfortunates sometimes concoct to escape their fate!I
was told of a physician who was "working up a cough," to have an excuse to
go west "for his health."How often we hear or read of some bright doctor
or lawyer who had a "growing" practice and a "bright future" before him,
having to change his occupation on account of his health failing!I believe old and observing professional
men will bear me out in it.Statistics of the conditions in the
professions are unobtainable, but I feel sure would only corroborate my
statement.In a recent medical journal was an article by a St.Louis
physician, which said the situation among medical men of that city was
"appalling."Of the 1,100 doctors there, dozens of them were living on
ten-cent lunches at the saloons, and with shiny clothes and unkempt
persons were holding on in despair, waiting for something better, or
sinking out of sight of the profession in hopeless defeat.This is a discouraging outlook, but it is time some such pictures were
held up before the multitude of young people of both sexes who are
entering medical and other schools, aspiring to professional life.And it
is time for society to recognize some of the responsibility for graft that
rests on it, for setting standards that cause commercialism to dominate
the age.American Public Generally Intelligent, but Densely Ignorant in
    Important Particulars--Cotton Mather and Witchcraft--A.B.'s,
    M.D.'s Espousing Christian Science, Chiropractics and
    Osteopathy--Gullibility of the College Bred--The Ignorant Suspicious
    of New Things--The Educated Man's Creed--Dearth of Therapeutic
    Knowledge by the Laity--Is the Medical Profession to
    Blame?--Physicians' Arguments Controvertible--Host of Incompetents
    Among the Regular Physicians--Report of Committee on Medical
    Colleges--The "Big Doctors"--Doc Booze--The "Leading Doctor"--Osler's
    Drug Nihilism--The X-Ray Graft.In spite of the apparent prevalence of graft and the seemingly
unprecedented dishonesty of those who serve the public, there are not
wanting signs of the coming of better things.The eminent physician who
spoke of the turbidity of therapeutics thought it was only that agitation
that precedes crystallization and clarification that brings purity, and
not greater pollution.May the seeming bad condition not be due in part
also to the fact that a larger number of our American people are becoming
intelligent enough to know the sham from the genuine, and to know when
they are being imposed upon?That our American people are generally intelligent we know; but that a
people may be generally intelligent and yet densely ignorant in important
particulars has been demonstrated in all ages, and in no age more clearly
than in our own.We wonder how the great scholar, Cotton Mather, could
have believed in and taught witchcraft.What shall we think, in this
enlightened age, of judges pleading for the healing (?)virtues of
Christian Science, or of college professors taking treatment from a
Chiropractor or magnetic healer; or of the scores of A.B.s, A.M.s, M.D.s,
Ph.D.s, who espouse Osteopathy and use the powers of their supposedly
superior intellect in its propagation?We can only come to this conclusion: The college education of to-day does
not necessarily make one proof against graft.In fact, it seems that when
it comes to belief in "new scientific discoveries," the educated are even
more easily imposed upon than the ignorant.The ignorant man is apt to be
suspicious of new things, especially things that are supposed to require
scientific knowledge to comprehend.On the other hand, the man who prides
himself on his learning is sure he can take care of himself, and often
thinks it a proof of his superior intelligence to be one of the charter
members of every scientific fad that is sprung on the people by some
college professor who is striving for a medal for work done in original
research.Whatever the reason may be, the fact remains that frauds and grafts are
perpetrated upon educated people to-day.In the preceding chapter I tried
to tell in a general way what some of the grafts are, and something of the
social conditions that help to produce the grafters.I shall now give some
of the reasons why shysters find so many easy victims for their grafts.When it comes to grafting in connection with therapeutics, the layman's
educational armor, which affords him protection against most forms of
graft in business, seems utterly useless.True, it affords protection
against the more vulgar nostrum grafting that claims its millions of
victims among the masses; but when the educated man meets the "new
discovery," "new method" grafter he bares his bosom and welcomes him as a
friend and fellow-scientist.It is the educated man's creed to-day to
accept everything that comes to him in the name of science.The average educated man knows nothing whatever of the theory and _modus
operandi_ of therapeutics.He is perhaps possessed of some knowledge of
everything on the earth, in the heaven above, and in the waters beneath.He is, however, densely ignorant of one of the most important things of
all--therapeutics--the matter of possessing an intelligent conception of
what are rational and competent means of caring for his body when it is
attacked by disease.A man who writes A.M., D.D., or LL.D.after his name
will send for a physician of "any old school," and put his life or the
life of a member of his family into his hands with no intelligent idea
whatever as to whether the right thing is being done to save that life.Is this ignorance of therapeutics on the part of the otherwise educated
the result of a studied policy of physicians to mystify the public and
keep their theories from the laity?I read in a medical magazine recently a question the editor
put to his patrons.He told them he had returned money sent by a layman
for a year's subscription to his journal, and asked if such action met
their approval.If the majority of the physicians who read his journal do
approve his action, their motives _may_ be based on considerations that
are for the public good, for aught I know, but as a representative layman
I see much more to commend in the attitude of the editor of the _Journal
of the A. M. A._ on the question of admitting the public to the confidence
of the physician.As I have quoted before, he says: "The time has passed
when we can wrap ourselves in a cloak of professional dignity and assume
an attitude of infallibility toward the public."Such sentiment freely
expressed would, I believe, soon change the attitude of the laity toward
physicians from one which is either suspicion or open hostility to one of
respect and sympathy.The argument has been made by physicians that it would not do for the
public to read all their discussions and descriptions of diseases, as
their imagination would reproduce all the symptoms in themselves.Others
have urged that it will not do to let the public read professional
literature, for they might draw conclusions from the varied opinions they
read that would not be for the good of the profession.Both arguments
remind one of the arguments parents make as an excuse for not teaching
their children the mysteries of reproduction.They did not want to put
thoughts into the minds of their children that might do them harm.At the
same time they should know that the thoughts would be, and were being, put
into their children's minds from the most harmful and corrupting sources.Are not all symptoms of disease put before the people
anyway, and from the worst possible sources?If medical men do not know
this, let them read some of the ads.And are
the contradictions and inconsistencies in discussions in medical journals
kept from the public?If medical men think so, let them read the
Osteopathic and "independent" journals.The public knows too much already,
considering the sources from which the knowledge comes.Since people will
be informed, why not let them get information that is authentic?Before I studied the literature of leading medical journals I believed
that the biggest and brainiest physicians were in favor of fair and frank
dealing with the public.I had learned this much from observation and
contact with medical men.After a careful study of the organ of the
American Medical Association my respect for that organization is greatly
increased by finding expressions in numbers of articles which show that my
opinion was correct.In spite of all the vituperation that is heaped upon
it, and in spite of the narrowness of individual members, the American
Medical Association does seem to exist for the good of humanity.The
strongest recommendation I have found for it lies in the character of the
schools and individuals who are most bitter against it.It is usually
complimentary to a man to have rascals array themselves against him.There are many able men among physicians who feel keenly their
limitations, when they have done their best, and this class would gladly
have their patients understand the limitations as well as the powers of
the physician.In sorrow and disgust sometimes the conscientious physician
realizes that he is handicapped in his work to either prevent or cure
disease, because he has to work with people who have wrong notions of his
power and of the potency of agencies he employs.With shame he must
acknowledge that the people hold such erroneous ideas of medicine, not
because of general ignorance, but because they have been intentionally
taught them by the army of quacks outside and the host of grafters and
incompetents _inside_ the regular medical profession.Incompetent physicians, to succeed financially (and that is the only idea
of success incompetents are capable of appreciating), must practice as
shysters.They fully understand how necessary it is to the successful
working of their grafts to keep the people in ignorance of what a
physician may legitimately and conscientiously do.Our medical brethren who preach the "all but holy" doctrine, and want to
maintain the "attitude of infallibility toward the public," will disagree
with me about there being "a host" of incompetents in the regular school
of medical practice.I shall not ask that they take the possibly biased
opinion of an ex-Osteopath, but refer them to the report of the committee
appointed by the American Medical Association to examine the medical
colleges of the United States as to their ability to make competent
physicians."One-half of all the medical schools of our country are
utterly unfit to turn out properly qualified physicians, and many of them
are so dominated by commercialism that they are but little better than
diploma mills"!It has been argued that the capable physician need not fear the
incompetent pretender, for, like dregs, he must "settle to the bottom" and
find his place.This might be true if the people had correct notions of
the true theory of therapeutics.As it is, the scholarly, competent
physician knows (and intelligent laymen often know) that the pretenders
too often are the fellows who get the reputations of being the "big
doctors."I think mainly because, being ignorant, they practice
largely as quacks, and by curing (?)all kinds of dangerous (on their own
diagnosis) diseases quickly, "breaking up" this and "aborting" that
unbreakable and unabortable disease (by "hot air" treatment mainly), they
place the whole system upon such a basis of quackery that the deluded
masses often pronounce the best equipped and most conscientious physician
a "poor doctor," because he will not pretend to do all that the
wind-jamming grafter claims _he has_ done and _can_ do.Here is a case in point which I know to be true.The farce began some
years ago in a small college in Oregon.A big, awkward, harmless-looking
fellow came to the college one fall and entered the preparatory
department.At the end of the year, after he had failed in every
examination and shown conclusively that he had no capacity to learn
anything, he was told that it was a waste of time for him to go to school,
and they could not admit him for another year.The fires of ambition yet burned in his breast, and the next year he
turned up at a medical college.I presume it had the same high educational
requirements for admission that some other medical colleges have, and
enforced them in about the same way.At any rate he met the requirements
($$$), and pursued his medical researches with bright visions of being a
doctor to lure him on.But his inability to learn anything manifested
itself again, and, presumably, his money gave out.At any rate he was sent
away without a diploma.Still the fire of ambition was not extinguished in
his manly bosom.Regulations were not strict in those days, so he went to
a small town, wore fine clothes, a silk hat and a pompous air, and--within
a short time was being called for forty miles around to "counsel little
doctors" in their desperate cases.Such cases are all too common, as
honest physicians know.How humiliating to the conscientiously equipped doctor to hear people say
of a man who never had more brains than he needed, and had hopelessly
muddled what he had by using his own dope and stimulants: "I tell you Doc
Booze is the best doctor in town yet when he's half sober!"Strange, isn't
it, that in many communities people have an idea that an inclination on
the part of a physician toward whisky or dope indicates some peculiar
mental fitness for a doctor?"Poor fellow, he formed the habit of taking
stimulants to keep up when he had to go night and day during the big
typhoid epidemic, you know."of cases of medical
dipsomaniacs this constitutes a stock excuse, only medical men know.As an
Osteopathic physician I was never rushed so that I felt the necessity for
"keeping up on stimulants."If I had been, to be consistent, I should have
had to stimulate (?)Not only do shysters and pretenders abuse the confidence of the masses in
matters of diagnosis and medication, but of late years they are working
another species of graft that is beginning to react against the
profession.This graft consists in the over-use of therapeutic appliances
that are all right in their place when legitimately used.By what standard is the physician judged by the people who enter his
office?It used to be the display of medical literature.Sometimes some of
it was pseudo-medical literature.Did you ever know a shyster to pad his
library with Congressional reports?The literature used to be
conspicuously placed in the waiting-room, with a ponderous volume lying
open on the desk.Have you a "leading doctor" in your town?Often he is not only in the lead
but has flagged all the others at the quarter post--put them all into the
"has been" class.Plush rugs and luxurious
couches in the waiting-room.Double doors into the private and
operating-rooms, left open when not in actual use to give impressive
glimpses of glass cases filled with glittering instruments, any one of
which would give the lie to Solomon's declaration that "there is nothing
new under the sun."An X-ray machine fills a conspicuous corner.In the
same room are tanks, tubes, inhalers, hot-air appliances, vibrators, etc.One full side of the room is filled with shelves that groan under a load
of the medicines he "keeps and dispenses."What are all of these hundreds
of bottles for if it is true, as many of our greatest physicians say, that
a comparatively few people are benefited by drugs?I do not know as to that, but I do know something of
the impression such a display makes on the mind of an intelligent layman.The query in his mind is how much of that entire display is for its
legitimate effect on the minds of the patients, and how much of it is to
impress the people with the powers of this physician, with his "wonderful
equipment" to cope with all manner of disease?If there is any doubt in the minds of physicians that laymen do know and
think well over the sayings of drug nihilists, let them talk with
intelligent people and hear them quote from the editorial page of a great
daily such sentiments as this (from the Chicago _Record-Herald_):

    "Prof.William Osier, the distinguished teacher of medicine, who was
    taken from this country a few years ago to occupy the most important
    medical chair in Great Britain, has shocked his profession repeatedly
    by his pronouncements against the use of drugs and medicines of almost
    every kind.Only a few days ago he made an address in which he
    declared that even though most physicians will be deprived of their
    livelihood, the time must soon come when sound hygienic advice for the
    prevention of disease will take the place of the present system of
    prescription and _pretense of cure_.The most able physicians agree
    with him, even when they are not frank enough to express themselves to
    the same effect."Medical men need not think, either, that the people who happened to read
the editorial pages referred to are the only ones who know of that
declaration from Osier.Osteopathic journals, Christian Science journals,
health culture journals, and all the riff-raff of journals published as
individual boosters, are ever on the watch for just such things, and when
they find them they "roll them under their tongue as sweet morsels."They
chew them, as Carleton says, with "the cud of fancy," and hand them along
as latest news to tens of thousands of people who are quick to believe
them.Going back to the physician who has the well-equipped office, is he a
grafter in any sense?Perhaps every thing he
has in the office is legitimate.In the opinion of the masses of that
community he is the greatest doctor that ever prescribed a pill or
purloined an appendix.Taking the word of the physicians whom he has put
into the "has been" class for it, he is the greatest fake that ever fooled
the people.Most of those outclassed doctors will talk at any time, in any
place, to any one, of the pretensions of this type of physician.They will
tell how he dazzles the people with his display of apparatus "kept for
show;" how he diagnoses malarial fever as typhoid, and thus gets the
reputation of curing a larger per cent.of typhoid than any other doctor
in town; how he gets the reputation of being a big surgeon by cutting out
healthy ovaries and appendices, and how he assists with his knife women
who do not desire Rooseveltian families.They point to the number of
appendectomies he has performed, and recall how rare such cases were
before his advent, and yet how few people died with appendicitis.Is it to
be wondered that intelligent laymen sometimes lose faith in and respect
for the profession of medicine and surgery?To show that people may be imposed upon by illegitimate use of legitimate
agencies I call attention to an article published recently in the _Iowa
Health Bulletin_.The Iowa Medical Board is winning admiration from many
by conducting a campaign to educate the people of the State in matters
pertaining to hygienic living.In line with this work they published an
article to correct the erroneous idea the laity have of the X-ray.They
say:

    "The people think that with the X-ray the doctor can look right into
    the body and examine any part or organ and tell just what is the
    matter with it, when the fact is all that is ever seen is a lot of dim
    shadows that even the expert often fails to understand or recognize."Why do the people have such erroneous conceptions of the X-ray?Is it
accidental, or the result of their innate stupidity?The people have just such conceptions of the X-ray as they receive from
the faker who uses it as he uses his opiates and stimulants--to get an
effect and give the people wrong ideas of his power.A lady of a small town who was far advanced in consumption was taken to a
city to be examined by a "big doctor" who possessed an X-ray.He
"examined" her thoroughly by the aid of the penetrating light made by his
machine, and sent them home delighted with the assurance that his
wonderful instrument revealed no tuberculosis.He assured her that if she
would avail herself of his superior skill she might yet be restored to
health.She died within a year from the ravages of tuberculosis.A boy of four had an aggravated attack of bronchitis.His symptoms were
such that his parents thought some object might have lodged in his
trachea.A noted surgeon who had come one hundred miles from a hospital to
see another case was consulted.He told the parents that the boy had
sucked something down his windpipe, and advised them to bring him to the
hospital for an operation.They did so, and a $100 incision was made
after the X-ray had located (?)an object lodged at the bifurcation of the
trachea.The knife found nothing, however, and the boy still had his
bronchitis, and the parents had their hospital and surgeon's bills, and,
incidentally, their faith in the X-ray somewhat shattered.The X-rays, Finsen rays, electric light and sunlight have their place in
therapy.However, the history
of the use of these agents is a common one.A scientist, after possibly a
lifetime of research, develops a new therapeutic agent or a new
application of some old agent.Immediately a lot of half-baked professional men seize upon it, more with
the object of self-laudation and advertisement than in a true scientific
spirit.Serious study in the application of the new agent is not thought
of.The object is rather to have the reputation of being an up-to-snuff
man.The results obtained are not what the originator claimed, which is
not to be wondered at.The abuse of the remedy leads to abuse of the
originator, which is entirely unfair to both.This state of affairs has grown so bad that scientists now are beginning
to restrict the application of their discoveries to their own pupils.A
Berlin _savant_, assistant to Koch, has developed the use of tuberculin to
such a point as to make it one of the most valuable remedies in
tuberculosis.It is manufactured under his personal supervision, and sold
only to such physicians as will study in his laboratory and show
themselves competent to grasp the principles involved.TURBID THERAPEUTICS.An Astounding Array of Therapeutic
    Systems--Diet--Water--Optics--Hemotherapy--Consumption
    Cures--Placebos--Inconsistencies and Contradictions--Osler's Opinion
    of Appendicitis--Fair Statement of Limitations in Medicine Desirable.To be convinced that therapeutics are turbid, note the increasing numbers
of diametrically opposed schools springing up and claiming to advocate the
only true system of healing.Look at the astounding array:

Allopathy, Homeopathy, Eclecticism, Osteopathy, Electrotherapy, Christian
Science, Emmanuel movement, Hydrotherapy, Chiropractics, Viteopathy,
Magnetic Healing, Suggestive Therapeutics, Naturopathy, Massotherapy,
Physio-Therapy, and a host of minor fads that are rainbow-hued bubbles for
a day.They come and go as Byron said some therapeutic fads came and went
in his day.He spoke of the new things that astounded the people for a
day, and then, as it has been with

  "Cowpox, tractors, galvanism and gas,
  The bubble bursts and all is air at last."One says he has found that fasting is a panacea.Another says: "He is a
fool; you must feed the body if you expect it to be built up."One says drinking floods of water is a cure-all.Another says the water is
all right, but you must use it for the "internal bath."Still another
agrees that water is the thing, but it must be used in hot and cold
applications.One faker says _he_ has found that most diseases are caused by defective
eyes, and proposes to cure anything from consumption to ingrown toe-nails
with glasses.Another agrees that the predisposing cause of diseases is
eye strain, but the first fellow is irrational in his treatment.Glasses
are unnatural and therefore all wrong.To cure the eyes use his wonderful
nature-assisting ointment; that goes right to the optic nerve and makes
old eyes young, weak eyes strong, relieves nerve strain and thereby makes
sick people well.Another has found that "infused" blood is the real elixir of life.of twenty cases of tuberculosis cured by his
beneficent discovery.I wonder why we have a "Great White Plague" at all;
or why we have international conventions to discuss means of staying the
ravages of this terrible disease; or why State medical boards are devoting
so much space in their bulletins to warn and educate the people against
the awful fatality of consumption, when to cure it is so easy if doctors
will only use blood?Even if the hemotherapist does claim a little too much, there is yet no
cause for terror.A leading Osteopathic journal proclaims in large
letters that the Osteopath can remove the obstruction so that nature will
cure consumption.Christian Scientists and Magnetic Healers have not yet admitted their
defeat, and there are many regulars who have not surrendered to the
plague.So the poor consumptive may hope on (while his money lasts).Our
most conscientious physicians not only admit limitations in curing
tuberculosis, but try to teach the people that they must not rely on being
"cured" if they are attacked, but must work with the physician to prevent
its contagion.The intelligent layman can say "Amen" to that doctrine.The question may be fairly put: "Why not have more of such frankness from
the physician?"The manner in which the admissions of doctors that they
are unable to control tuberculosis with medicine or surgery alone has been
received by intelligent people should encourage the profession.It would
seem more fair to take the stand of Professor Osler when he says that
sound hygienic advice for the prevention of diseases must largely take the
place of present medication and pretence of cure.As a member of the American Medical Association recently said, "The
placebo will not fool intelligent people always."And when it is generally
known that most of a physician's medicines are given as placebos, do you
wonder that the claims of "drugless healers" receive such serious
consideration?The absurd, conflicting claims of quack pretenders are bad enough to
muddle the situation and add to the turbidity of therapeutics; but all
this is not doing the medical profession nearly as much harm, nor driving
as many people into the ranks of fad followers, as the inconsistencies and
contradictions among the so-called regulars.This was my opinion before I made any special study of therapeutics, and
while studying I found numbers of prominent medical men who agree with me.One of them says that the "criticisms," quarrels, contradictions, and
inconsistencies of medical men are doing more to lower the profession in
the estimation of the intelligent laity and to cause people to follow the
fads of "new schools" than all else combined.Think for a moment of some of these inconsistencies and contradictions.One doctor in a town tells the people that he "breaks up" typhoid fever.His rival, perhaps from the same college, tells the people that typhoid
must "run its course" and cannot be broken up, and that any man who claims
the contrary is a liar and a shyster.One surgeon makes a portion of the
people believe he has saved dozens of lives in that community by surgical
operations; the other physicians of the town tell the people openly, or at
least hint, that there has been a great deal of needless butchery
performed in that community in the name of surgery.And then the people
see editorials in the daily press about the fad of having operations
performed, and read in their health culture or Osteopathic journals from
articles by the greatest M.D.s, in which it is admitted that surgery is
practiced too largely as a graft.Professor Osler is quoted as saying:

    "Surgeons are finding altogether too many cases of appendicitis these
    days.Appendicitis is becoming so common and so easily detected that
    the physician's wife can diagnose a case of it over the telephone."One leading physician says medical treatment has little beneficial effect
on pneumonia; another claims to be able to cure it, and lets the friends
of his patient rely entirely on his medicine in the most desperate cases.Another says, "All those clay preparations
are frauds, and the only safe way to treat pneumonia is by blood letting."Thus it goes, and this is only a sample of contradictions that arise in
the treatment of diseases.Most of it was from the journal of
the editor who said he refused to send it to a layman who had sent his
money in advance.But all that same stuff has been hashed and rehashed to
the people through the sources I have already mentioned.There are not
only these evidences of inconsistencies to edify (?)the people, but
constantly recurring examples of incompetency and pretensions.There is no doubt a middle ground in all this, but it is not evident to
the casual observer.If the true physician would honestly admit his
limitations to the intelligent laity, much of this muddle would be
avoided.While by such a course he may occasionally temporarily lose a
patient, in the end both the public and profession would gain.The time
has gone by to "assume an air of infallibility toward the public."CHAPTER V.

THE EXPERT WITNESS AND PROPRIETARY MEDICINES.The "Great Nerve Specialist"--The Professional Witness a Jonah--The
    "Railway Spine"--Is it Lack of Fairness and Honesty or Lack of Skill
    and Learning?--Destruction of Fine Herds of Cattle Without
    Compensation--Koch's Dictum and Denial--Koch's Tuberculin--The Serum
    Tribe--Stupendous Sale of Nostrums--Druggist's Arguments--Use of
    Proprietary Medicines Stimulates Sale of Nostrums.I wonder what the patrons of the sanitarium of the "great nerve
specialist" thought of his display of knowledge of the nervous system when
he was on the witness stand in a recent notorious case?A lawyer tangled
him up completely, and showed that the doctor had no accurate knowledge of
the anatomy of the nervous system.When asked the origin of the
all-important pneumogastric nerve, he _thought_ it originated in a certain
segment of the spinal cord!This noted "specialist" was made perfectly
contemptible, and the whole profession must have blushed in shame at the
spectacle presented.And that spectacle was not unnoticed by the
intelligent laity.The professional witness has in most cases been a Jonah to the profession.It is about as easy to get the kind of testimony you want from a
professional witness in a suit for damages for personal injuries as it is
to get a doctor's certificate to get out of working your poll-tax, or a
certificate of physical soundness to carry fraternal life insurance.Let me recall the substance of a paper read a few years ago by perhaps the
greatest lawyer in Iowa (afterward governor of that State).He told of a
trial in which he had examined and cross-examined ten physicians.It was a
trial in which suit was brought to recover damages for personal injury, a
good illustration of the "railway spine."One physician testified that the
patient was afflicted with sclerosis of the spinal cord; another said it
was a plain case of congestion of the cord; another diagnosed degeneration
of the cord; yet another said it was a true combination of all the
conditions named by the first three.They all said there was atrophy of
the muscles of the left leg, and predicted that complete paralysis would
surely supervene.On the other side five noted physicians testified as positively that
neither the spinal cord nor any nerve was injured; that there was no sign
of atrophy or loss of power in the leg; and they seemed to think the
disease afflicting the patient was due to a fixed desire to secure a
verdict for large damages from the railway company.One eminent specialist
made oath that the electrical test showed the partial reaction of
degeneration; another as famous challenged him to make the test again in
the presence of both.After it was made this second specialist went before
the jury and positively declared that there was no trace whatever of the
reaction of degeneration, and that the muscles responded to the current
precisely as healthy muscles should.Then this eminent attorney adds: "If the instances of such diversity were
rare they might pass unnoticed, but they occur and re-occur as often as
physicians are called to the temple of justice for the expression of
opinions."The lay mind imputes this clash of opinions either to lack of fairness and
honesty or lack of skill and learning.In either case the profession
suffers great injury in the estimation of those who should have for it
only the profoundest admiration and the most implicit faith.Again I ask,
Is it any wonder people have lost implicit faith when they read many
reports of similar cases rehashed in the various yellow journals put into
their hands?Farmers submitted with all possible grace to the decrees of science when,
by the authority of such a great man as Koch, their fine herds of cattle
were condemned as breeders and disseminators of the great white plague and
destroyed without compensation.But how do you think these same farmers
feel when they read in yellow journals that Koch has changed his mind
about bovine and human tuberculosis being identical, and has serious
doubts about the one contracting in any way the disease of the other.People read with renewed hope the glowing accounts of the wonderful
achievements of Dr.Koch in finding a destroyer for the germ of
consumption.Somehow time has slipped by since that renowned discovery,
with consumption still claiming its victims, and many physicians are
saying "Koch's great discovery is proving only a great disappointment."Drugless therapy journals are continually pouring out the vials of their
wrath upon vaccination, antitoxin and all the serum tribe, and their
vituperation is even excelled by vindictive denunciations of the same
things by the individual boomer journals that flood the land.Another bitter contention that is confusing some, and disgusting others,
is the acrimonious strife between users and non-users of proprietary
medicines.This usually develops into a sort of "rough house" affair, the
druggist mixing up as savagely as the doctors before the fight is
finished.I know nothing of the rights or wrongs of the case nor of the
merits or demerits of proprietary medicines, but I do know this, however:
The stupendous sale of nostrums that in 1907 represented a sum of money
sufficient to have provided every practitioner of medicine in the United
States with a two thousand dollar salary, has been helped by the use of
proprietary medicines.I am aware that my position is likely to be called
in question by many physicians.But they should hear druggists arguing
with people who hesitate about buying patent medicines because their
physicians tell them they should seldom take medicine unless prescribed by
a doctor.They would hear him say: "Your doctor gives you medicines that
are put up in quantities for him just as these patent medicines are put up
for us."He then produces literature and proves it--at least beyond the
refutation of the patient.Physicians would then realize, perhaps, how the
use of proprietary medicines stimulates the sale of nostrums.FAITH CURE AND GRAFT IN SURGERY.Suggestive Therapeutics Chief Stock in Trade--Advice of a Medical
    College President--Disease Prevention Rather than Cure--Hygienic
    Living--The Medical Pretender--"Dangerous Diagnosis" Graft--Great
    Flourish of Trumpets--No "Starving Time" for Him--"Big
    Operations"--Mutilating the Human Body--Dr.C. W. Oviatt's Views--Dr.Maurice H. Richardson's Incisive Statements--Crying Need for
    Reform--Surgery that is Useless, Conscienceless and for Purely
    Commercial Ends--Spirit of Surgical Graft, Especially in the
    West--Fee-Splitting and Commissions--A Nation of "Dollar-Chasers"--The
    Public's Share of Responsibility--Senn's Advice--The "Surgical
    Conscience."I think we have enough before us to show why intelligent people become
followers of fads.Seeing so many impositions and frauds, they forget all
the patient research and beneficent discoveries of noble men who have
devoted their lives to the work of giving humanity better health and
longer life.They are ready at once to denounce the whole medical system
as a fraud, and become victims of the first "new system" or healing fad
that is plausibly presented to them.And here a question arises that is puzzling to many.If these systems are
fads and frauds, why do they so rapidly get and retain so large a
following among intelligent people?The
quacks of these fad schools get their cures, as every intelligent doctor
of the old schools knows, in the same way and upon the same principle that
is so important a factor in medical practice, _i.e._, _faith cure_--the
psychic effect of the thing done, whether it be the giving of a dose of
medicine, a Christian Science pow-wow, the laying on of hands, the
"removal of a lesion" by an Osteopath, the "adjustment" of the spine by a
Chiropractor, or what not.The principles of mind or faith cure are legitimately used by the honest
physician.Suggestive therapeutics is being systematically studied by many
who want to use it with honesty and intelligence.They realize fully that
abuse of this principle figures largely in the maintenance of the shysters
in their own school, and it is the very foundation of all new schools and
healing fads.The people must be made to know this, or fads will continue
to flourish.The honest physician would be glad to have the people know more than this.He would be glad to have them know enough about symptoms of diseases to
have some idea when they really need the help of a physician.For he knows
that if the people knew this much all quacks would be speedily put out of
business.I wonder how many doctors know that observing people are beginning to
suspect that many physicians regulate the number of calls they make on a
patient by motives other than the condition of the patient--size of
pocketbook and the condition of the roads, for instance.I am aware that
such imputation is an insult to any physician worthy of the name, but the
sad fact is that there are so many, when we count the quacks of all
schools, unworthy of the name.Louis medical college once said to a large
graduating class: "Young men, don't go to your work with timidity and
doubts of your ability to succeed.Look and act your part as physicians,
and when you have doubts concerning your power over disease _remember
this_, ninety-five out of every hundred people who send for you would get
well just the same if they never took a drop of your medicine."I have
never mentioned this to a doctor who did not admit that it is perhaps
true.If so, is there not enough in it alone to explain the apparent
success of quacks?Again I say there are many noble and brainy physicians, and these have
made practically all the great discoveries, invented all the useful
appliances, written all the great books for other schools to study, and
they should have credit from the people for all this, and not be
misrepresented by little pretenders.Their teachings should be applied as
they gave them.The best of them to-day would have the people taught that
a physician's greatest work may be done in preventing rather than in
curing disease.Physicians of the Osler type would like to have the people
understand how little potency drugs have to cure many dangerous diseases
when they have a firm hold on the system.They would have some of the
responsibility removed from the shoulders of the physician by having the
people understand how much they may do by hygienic living and common-sense
use of natural remedies.But the conscientious doctor too often has to compete with the pretender
who wants the people to believe that _he_ is their hope and their
salvation, and in him they must trust.He wants them to believe that he
has a specific remedy for every disease that will go "right to the spot"
and have the desired effect.People who believe this, and believe that
without doctoring the patient could never get well, will sometimes try, or
see their neighbors try, a doctor of a "new school."When they see about
the same proportion of sick recover, they conclude, of course, that the
doctor of the "new school" cured them, and is worthy to be forever after
intrusted with every case of disease that may arise in their families.This is often brought about by the shyster M.D.overreaching himself by
diagnosing some simple affection as something very dangerous, in order to
have the greater credit in curing it.But he at times overestimates the
confidence of the family in his ability.They are ready to believe that
the patient's condition is critical, and in terror, wanting the help of
everything that promises help, call in a doctor of some "new school"
because neighbors told how he performed wonderful cures in their families.When the patient recovers speedily, as he would have done with no
treatment of any kind, and just as the shyster M.D.thought he would, the
glory and credit of curing a "bad case" of a "dangerous disease" go to the
new system instead of redounding to the glory of Dr.Shyster, as he
planned it would.Is it any wonder true physicians sometimes get disgusted with their
profession when they see a shyster come into the town where they have
worked for years, patiently and conscientiously building up a legitimate
practice that begins to promise a decent living, and by such quack methods
as diagnosing cases of simple fever, such as might come from acute
indigestion or too much play in children, as something dangerous, typhoid
or "threatened typhoid," or cases of congestion of the lungs as "lung
fever," and by "aborting" or "curing" these terrible diseases in short
order and having his patients out in a few days, jumps into fame and
(financial) success at a bound?Because the typhoid (real typhoid)
patients of the honest doctor lingered for weeks and sometimes died, and
because frequently he lost a case of real pneumonia, he made but a poor
showing in comparison with the new doctor."He's just fresh from school,
you know, from a post-graduate course in the East."Or, "He's been to the
old country and _knows_ something."Just as if any physician, though he
may have been out of school for many years, does not, or may not, know of
all the curative agencies of demonstrated merit!Would a medical journal fail to keep its readers posted concerning any new
discovery in medicine, or helpful appliance that promises real good to the
profession?Yet people speak of one doctor's superior knowledge of the
best treatment of a particular disease as if that doctor had access to
some mysterious source of therapeutic knowledge unknown to other
physicians.It is becoming less easy to work the "dangerous diagnosis"
graft than formerly, for many people are learning that certain diseases
must "run their course," and that there are no medicines that have
specific curative effects on them.There is another graft now that is taking the place of the one just
mentioned, to some extent at least.In the hands of a fellow with lots of
nerve and little conscience it is the greatest of them all.This is the
graft of the smart young fellow direct from a post-graduate course in the
clinics of some great surgeon.He comes to town with a great flourish of trumpets.Of course, he observes
the ethics of the profession!The long accounts of his superior education
and unusual experience with operative surgery are only legitimate items of
news for the local papers.It is only right that such an
unusual doctor should have so much attention.There is no "starving time" for him.No weary wait of years for patients
to come.At one bound he leaps into fame and fortune by performing "big
operations" right and left, when before his coming such cases were only
occasionally found, and then taken to surgeons of known ability and
experience.The reputable physician respects surgery, and would respect
the bright young fellow fresh from contact with the latest approved
methods who has nerve to undertake the responsibility of a dangerous
operation when such an operation is really indicated.But when it comes to
mutilating the human body by cutting away an appendix or an ovary because
it is known that to remove them when neither they nor the victim are much
diseased is a comparatively safe and very _quick_ way to get a big
reputation--that is the limit of quackery.And no wonder such a man is so
cordially hated by his brethren.He not always hated because he mutilates
humanity so much, as because his spectacular graft in surgery is sure to
be taken as proof conclusive that he is superior in all other departments
of therapeutics.And it puzzles observing laymen sometimes to know why all the successful
(?)operations are considered such desirable items of news, while the
cases that are not flattering in their outcome pass unmentioned.I find most complete corroboration of my contention in the president's
address, delivered before the Western Surgical and Gynecological
Association at St.Louis, in 1907, by Charles W. Oviatt, M.D.This address
was published in the _Journal of the American Medical Association_, and I
herewith reprint it in part:

    "The ambitious medical student does not usually get far into college
    work before he aspires to become a surgeon.He sees in the surgical
    clinics more definite and striking results than are discernible in
    other branches.Without being able to judge of his own relative
    fitness or whether he possesses the special aptitude so essential to
    success, he decides to become a surgeon.There will always be room for
    the young surgeon who, fitted by nature for the work, takes the time
    and opportunity to properly prepare himself.There is more good
    surgery being done to-day than ever before, and there are more good
    surgeons being educated to do the work.If, however, the surgeon of
    the future is to hold the high and honorable position our leaders have
    held in the past, there must be some standard of qualification
    established that shall protect the people against incompetency and
    dishonesty in surgeons."That there is much that passes under the name of surgery being done
    by ill-trained, incompetent men, will not be denied.What standard,
    then, should be established, and what requirement should be made
    before one should be permitted to do surgery?In his address as
    chairman of the Section on Surgery and Anatomy of the American Medical
    Association, at the Portland (1905) meeting, Dr.Maurice H. Richardson
    deals with this subject in such a forceful, clear-cut way, that I take
    the liberty to quote him at some length:

        "'The burden of the following remarks is that those only should
        practice surgery who by education in the laboratory, in the
        dissecting-room, by the bedside, and at the operating-table, are
        qualified, first, to make reasonably correct deductions from
        subjective and objective signs; secondly, to give sound advice for
        or against operations; thirdly, to perform operations skillfully
        and quickly, and, fourthly, to conduct wisely the after-treatment."'The task before me is a serious criticism of what is going on in
        every community.I do not single out any community or any man.There is in my mind no doubt whatever that surgery is being
        practiced by those who are incompetent to practice it--by those
        whose education is imperfect, who lack natural aptitude, whose
        environment is such that they never can gain that personal
        experience which alone will really fit them for what surgery means
        to-day.They are unable to make correct deductions from histories;
        to predict probable events; to perform operations skillfully, or
        to manage after-treatment."'All surgeons are liable to error, not only in diagnosis, but in
        the performance of operations based on diagnosis.Such errors must
        always be expected and included in the contingencies of the
        practice of medicine and surgery.Doubtless many of my hearers can
        recall cases of their own in which useless--or worse than
        useless--operations have been performed.If, however, serious
        operations are in the hands of men of large experience, such
        errors will be reduced to a minimum."'Many physicians send patients for diagnosis and opinion as to
        the advisability of operation without telling the consultant that
        they themselves are to perform the operation.The diagnosis is
        made and the operation perhaps recommended, when it appears that
        the operation is to be in incompetent hands.His advice should be
        conditional that it be carried out only by the competent.Many
        operations, like the removal of the vermiform appendix in the
        period of health, the removal of fibroids which are not seriously
        offending, the removal of gall-stones that are not causing
        symptoms, are operations of choice rather than of necessity; they
        are operations which should never be advised unless they are to be
        performed by men of the greatest skill.Furthermore, many
        emergency operations, such as the removal of an inflamed appendix
        and other operations for lesions which are not necessarily
        fatal--should be forbidden and the patient left to the chances of
        spontaneous recovery, if the operation proposed is to be performed
        by an incompetent."'And is not the surgeon, appreciating his own unfitness in spite
        of years of devotion, in the position to condemn those who lightly
        take up such burdens without preparation and too often without
        conscience?"'In view of these facts, who should perform surgery?How shall
        the surgeon be best fitted for these grave duties?As a matter of
        right and wrong, who shall, in the opinion of the medical
        profession, advise and perform these responsible acts and who
        shall not?Surgical operations should be performed only by those
        who are educated for that special purpose."'I have no hesitation in saying that the proper fitting of a man
        for surgical practice requires a much longer experience as a
        student and assistant than the most exacting schools demand.A man
        should serve four, five or six years as assistant to an active
        surgeon.During this period of preparation, as it were, as much
        time as possible should be given to observing the work of the
        masters of surgery throughout the world.'Richardson's ideal may seem almost utopian, there being so
    wide a difference between the standard he would erect and the one
    generally established, we must all agree that however impossible of
    attainment under present conditions, such an ideal is none too high
    and its future realization not too much to hope for."While there is being done enough poor surgery that is honest and well
    intended, there is much being done that is useless, conscienceless,
    and done for purely commercial ends.This is truly a disagreeable and
    painful topic and one that I would gladly pass by, did I not feel that
    its importance demands some word of condemnation coming through such
    representative surgical organizations as this."The spirit of graft that has pervaded our ranks, especially here in
    the West, is doing much to lower the standard and undermine the morals
    and ethics of the profession.When fee-splitting and the paying of
    commissions for surgical work began to be heard of something like a
    decade ago, it seemed so palpably dishonest and wrong that it was
    believed that it would soon die out, or be at least confined to the
    few in whom the inherited commercial instinct was so strong that they
    could not get away from it.But it did not die; on the other hand, it
    has grown and flourished."In looking for an explanation for the existence of this evil, I think
    several factors must be taken into account, among them being certain
    changes in our social and economic conditions.This is an age of
    commercialism.We are known to the world as a nation of "dollar
    chasers," where nearly everything that should contribute to right
    living is sacrificed to the Moloch of money.The mad rush for wealth
    which has characterized the business world, has in a way induced some
    medical men, whether rightfully or wrongfully, to adopt the same
    measures in self-protection.The patient or his friends too often
    insist on measuring the value of our services with a commercial
    yard-stick, the fee to be paid being the chief consideration.In this
    way the public must come in for its share of responsibility for
    existing conditions.So long as there are people who care so little
    who operates on them, just so long will there be cheap surgeons, cheap
    in every respect, to supply the demand.The demand for better
    physicians and surgeons must come in part from those who employ their
    services."Another source of the graft evil is the existence of low-grade,
    irregular and stock-company medical schools.In many of these schools
    the entrance requirements are not in evidence outside of their
    catalogues.With no standard of character or ethics, these schools
    turn out men who have gotten the little learning they possess in the
    very atmosphere of graft.The existence of these schools seems less
    excusable when we consider that our leading medical colleges rank with
    the best in the world and are ample for the needs of all who should
    enter the profession.Their constant aim is to still further elevate
    the standard and to admit as students only those who give unmistakable
    evidence of being morally and intellectually fit to become members of
    the profession."Enough men of character, however, are entering the field through
    these better schools to ensure the upholding of those lofty ideals
    that have characterized the profession in the past and which are
    essential to our continued progress.I think, therefore, that we may
    take a hopeful view of the future.The demand for better prepared
    physicians will eventually close many avenues that are now open to
    students, greatly to the benefit of all.With the curtailing of the
    number of students and a less fierce competition which this will
    bring, there will be less temptation, less necessity, if you will, on
    the part of general practitioners to ask for a division of fees.He
    will come to see that honest dealing on his part with the patient
    requiring special skill will in the long run be the best policy.He
    will make a just, open charge for the services he has rendered and not
    attempt to collect a surreptitious fee through a dishonest surgeon for
    services he has not rendered and could not render.Then, too, there
    will be less inducement and less opportunity for incompetent and
    conscienceless men to disgrace the art of surgery."The public mind is becoming especially active just at this time in
    combating graft in all forms, and is ready to aid in its destruction.The intelligent portion of the laity is becoming alive to the patent
    medicine evil.It is only a question of time when the people will
    demand that the secular papers which go into our homes shall not
    contain the vile, disgusting and suggestive quack advertisements that
    are found to-day.A campaign of reform is being instituted against
    dishonest politicians, financiers, railroad and insurance magnates,
    showing that their methods will be no longer tolerated.The moral
    standards set for professional men and men in public life are going to
    be higher in the future, and with the limelight of public opinion
    turned on the medical and surgical grafter, the evil will cease to
    exist.Hand in hand with this reform let us hope that there will come
    to be established a legal and moral standard of qualification for
    those who assume to do surgery."I feel sure that it is the wish of every member of this association
    to do everything possible to hasten the coming of this day and to aid
    in the uplifting of the art of surgery.Our individual effort in this
    direction must lie largely through the influence we exert over those
    who seek our advice before beginning the study of medicine, and over
    those who, having entered the work, are to follow in our immediate
    footsteps.To the young man who seeks our counsel as to the
    advisability of commencing the study of medicine, it is our duty to
    make a plain statement of what would be expected of him, of the cost
    in time and money, and an estimate of what he might reasonably expect
    as a reward for a life devoted to ceaseless study, toil and
    responsibility.If, from our knowledge of the character, attainments
    and qualifications of the young man we feel that at best he could make
    but a modicum of success in the work, we should endeavor to divert his
    ambition into some other channel."We should advise the 'expectant surgeon' in his preparation to follow
    as nearly as possible the line of study suggested by Richardson.Then
    I would add the advice of Senn, viz: 'To do general practice for
    several years, return to laboratory work and surgical anatomy, attend
    the clinics of different operators, and never cease to be a physician.If this advice is followed there will be less unnecessary operating
    done in the future than has been the case in the past.'The young man
    who enters special work without having had experience as a general
    practitioner, is seriously handicapped.In this age, when we have so
    frequently to deal with the so-called border-line cases, it is
    especially well never to cease being a physician."We would next have the young man assure himself that he is the
    possessor of a well-developed, healthy, working'surgical conscience.'No matter how well qualified he may be, his enthusiasm in the earlier
    years of his work will lead him to do operations that he would refrain
    from in later life.This will be especially true of malignant disease.He knows that early and thorough radical measures alone hold out hope,
    and only by repeated unsuccessful efforts will he learn to temper his
    ambition by the judgment that comes of experience.Pirogoff, the noted
    surgeon, suffered from a malignant growth.Billroth refused to operate
    or advise operation.In writing to another surgeon friend he said: 'I
    am not the bold operator whom you knew years ago in Zurich.Before
    deciding on the necessity of an operation, I always propose to myself
    this question: Would you permit such an operation as you intend
    performing on your patient to be done on yourself?Years and
    experience bring in their train a certain degree of hesitancy.'This,
    coming from one who in his day was the most brilliant operator in the
    world, should be remembered by every surgeon, young and old."In the hands of the skilled,
conscientious surgeon how great are thy powers for good to suffering
humanity!In the hands of shysters "what crimes are committed in thy
name!"With his own school full of shysters and incompetents, and grafters of
"new schools" and "systems" to compete with on every hand, the
conscientious physician seems to be "between the devil and the deep sea!"With quacks to the right of him, quacks to the left of him, quacks in
front of him, all volleying and thundering with their literature to prove
that the old schools, and all schools other than theirs, are frauds,
impostors and poisoners, about all that is left for the layman to do when
sick is to take to the woods.PART TWO

OSTEOPATHY




CHAPTER VII.SOME DEFINITIONS AND HISTORIES.Romantic Story of Osteopathy's Origin--An Asthma Cure--Headache Cured
    by Plowlines--Log Rolling to Relieve Dysentery--Osteopathy is Drugless
    Healing--Osteopathy is Manual Treatment--Liberty of Blood, Nerves and
    Arteries--Perfect Skeletal Alignment and Tonic, Ligamentous, Muscular
    and Facial Relaxation--Andrew T. Still in 1874--Kirksville, Mo., as a
    Mecca--American School of Osteopathy--The Promised Golden Stream of
    Prosperity--Shams and Pretenses--The "Mossbacks"--"Who's Who in
    Osteopathy."The story of the origin of Osteopathy is romantic enough to appeal to the
fancy of impressionists.It is almost as romantic as the finding of the
mysterious stones by the immortal Joe Smith.In this story is embodied the
life history of an old-time doctor and pioneer hero in his restless
migrations about the frontiers of Kansas and Missouri.His thrilling
experiences in the days of border wars and through the Civil War are
narrated, and how the germ of the idea of the true cause and cure of
disease was planted in his mind by the remark of a comrade as the two lay
concealed in a thicket for days to escape border ruffians.Then, later,
how the almost simultaneous death of two or three beloved children, whom
all his medical learning and that of other doctors he had summoned had
been powerless to save, had caused him to renounce forever the belief that
drugs could cure disease.He believed Nature had a true system, and for
this he began a patient search.He wandered here and there, almost in the
condition of the religious reformers of old, who "wandered up and down
clad in sheep-skins and goat-hides, of whom the world was not worthy."In
the name of suffering humanity he desecrated the grave of poor Lo, that he
might read from his red bones some clue to the secret.One Osteopathic journal claims to tell authentically how Still was led to
the discovery of the "great truth."It states that by accidentally curing
a case of asthma by "fooling with the bones of the chest," he was led to
the belief that bones out of normal position cause disease.Still himself tells a rather different story in a popular magazine posing
of late years as a public educator in matters of therapeutics.In this
magazine Still tells how he discovered the principles of Osteopathy by
curing a terrible headache resting the back of his neck across a swing
made of his father's plowlines, and next by writhing on his back across a
log to relieve the pain of dysentery.Accidentally the "lesion" was
corrected, or the proper center "inhibited," and his headache and flux
immediately cured.You can take your choice of these various versions of the wonderful
discovery.Ever since Osteopathy began to attract attention, and people began to
inquire "What is it?"its leading promoters have vied with each other in
trying to construct a good definition for their "great new science."Here are some of the definitions:

"Osteopathy is the science of drugless healing."For a genuine "lesion"
Osteopath that would not do at all.It is too broad and gives too much
scope to the physicians who would do more than "pull bones.""Osteopathy is practical anatomy and physiology skillfully and
scientifically applied as _manual_ treatment of disease."That definition
suits better, because of the "manual treatment."If you are a true
Osteopath you must do it _all_ with your hands.It will not do to use any
mechanical appliances, for if you do you cannot keep up the impression
that you are "handling the body with the skilled touch of a master who
knows every part of his machine.""The human body is a machine run by the unseen force called life, and that
it may run harmoniously it is necessary that there be liberty of blood,
nerves, and arteries from the generating point to destination."This
definition may be impressive to the popular mind, but, upon analysis, we
wonder if any other string of big words might not have had the same
effect."Liberty of blood" is a proposition even a stupid medical man must
admit.Of course, there must be free circulation of blood, and massage, or
hot and cold applications, or exercise, or anything that will stimulate
circulation, is rational.But when "liberty of blood" is mentioned, what
is meant by "liberty of arteries"?"Osteopathy seeks to obtain perfect skeletal alignment and tonic
ligamentous, muscular and facial relaxation."Some Osteopaths and other
therapeutic reformers (?)have contended that medical men purposely used
"big words" and Latin names to confound the laity.What must we think of
the one just given as a popular definition?A good many Osteopaths are becoming disgusted with the big words,
technical terms and "high-sounding nothings" used by so many Osteopathic
writers.The limit of this was never reached, however, until an A.B.,
Ph.D., D.O.wrote an article to elucidate Osteopathy for the general
public in an American encyclopedia.It takes scholarly wisdom to simplify
great truths and bring them to the comprehension of ordinary minds.If
writers for the medical profession want a lesson in the art of simplifying
and popularizing therapeutic science, they should study this article on
Osteopathy in the encyclopedia.A brief history of Osteopathy is perhaps in place.The following summary
is taken from leading Osteopathic journals.As to the personality and
motives of its founders I know but little; of the motives of its leading
promoters a candid public must be the judge.But judgment should be
withheld until all the truth is known.The principles of Osteopathy were discovered by Dr.He was at that time a physician of the old school practicing in
Kansas.His father, brothers and uncles were all medical practitioners.He
was at one time scout surgeon under General Fremont.During the Civil War
he was surgeon in the Union army in a volunteer corps.It was during the
war that he began to lose faith in drugs, and to search for something
natural in combating disease.Then began a long struggle with poverty and abuse.He was obstructed by
his profession and ridiculed by his friends.Fifteen years after the
discovery of Osteopathy found Dr.Still located in the little town of
Kirksville, Mo., where he had gradually attracted a following who had
implicit faith in his power to heal by what to them seemed mysterious
movements.His fame spread beyond the town, and chronic sufferers began to turn
toward Kirksville as a Mecca of healing.Others began to desire Still's
healing powers.In 1892 the American School of Osteopathy was founded,
which from a small beginning has grown until the present buildings and
equipment cost more than $100,000.Hundreds of students are graduated
yearly from this school, and large, well-equipped schools have been
founded in Des Moines, Philadelphia, Boston and California, with a number
of schools of greater or less magnitude scattered in other parts of the
country.More than four thousand Osteopaths were in the field in 1907, and
this number is being augmented every year by a larger number of physicians
than are graduated from Homeopathic colleges, according to Osteopathic
reports.About thirty-five States have given Osteopathy more or less favorable
legal recognition.The discussion of the subject of Osteopathy is of very grave importance.Important to practitioners of the old schools of medicine for reasons I
shall give further on, and of vital importance to the thousands of men and
women who have chosen Osteopathy as their life work.It is even of greater
importance in another sense to the people who are called upon to decide
which system is right, and which school they ought to rely upon when their
lives are at stake.I shall try to speak advisedly and conservatively, as I wish to do no one
injustice.I should be sorry indeed to speak a word that might hinder the
cause of truth and progress.I started out to tell of all that prevents
the sway of truth and honesty in therapeutics.I should come far short of
telling all if I omitted the inconsistencies of this "new science" of
healing that dares to assume the responsibility for human life, and makes
bold to charge that time-tried systems, with their tens of thousands of
practitioners, are wrong, and that the right remedy, or the best remedy
for disease has been unknown through all these years until the coming of
Osteopathy.And further dares to make the still more serious charge that
since the truth has been brought to light, the majority of medical men are
so blinded by prejudice or ignorance that they _will_ not see.This is not the first time I have spoken about inconsistencies in the
practice of Osteopathy.I saw so much of it in a leading Osteopathic
college that when I had finished I could not conscientiously proclaim
myself as an exponent of a "complete and well-rounded system of healing,
adequate for every emergency," as Osteopathy is heralded to be by the
journals published for "Osteopathic physicians" to scatter broadcast among
the people.I practiced Osteopathy for three years, but only as an
Osteopathic specialist.I never during that time accepted responsibility
for human life when I did not feel sure that I could do as much for the
case as any other might do with other means or some other system.Because I practiced as a specialist and would not claim that Osteopathy
would cure everything that any other means might cure, I have never been
called a good disciple of the new science by my brethren.I would not
practice as a grafter, find bones dislocated and "subluxated," and tell
people that they must take two or three months' treatment at twenty-five
dollars per month, to have one or two "subluxations" corrected.In
consequence I was never overwhelmed by the golden stream of prosperity the
literature that made me a convert had assured me would be forthcoming to
all "Osteopathic physicians" of even ordinary ability.As I said, this is not the first time I have spoken of the inconsistencies
of Osteopathy.While yet in active practice I became so disgusted with
some of the shams and pretences that I wrote a long letter to the editor
of an Osteopathic journal published for the good of the profession.This
editor, a bright and capable man, wrote me a nice letter in reply, in
which he agreed with me about quackery and incompetency in our profession.He did not publish the letter I wrote, or express his honest sentiments,
as I had hoped he might.If what I wrote to that editor was the truth, as
he acknowledged in private, it is time the public knew something of it.I
believe, also, that many of the large number of Osteopaths who have been
discouraged or disgusted, and quit the practice, will approve what I am
writing.There is another class of Osteopathic practitioners who, I
believe, will welcome the truth I have to tell.This consists of the large
number of men and women who are practicing Osteopathy as standing for all
that makes up rational physio-therapy.Speaking of those who have quit the practice of Osteopathy, I will say
that they are known by the Osteopathic faculties to be a large and growing
number.Yet Osteopathic literature sent to prospective students tells of
the small per cent.It may not be
known how many fail, but it is known that many have quit.A journey half across one of our Western States disclosed one Osteopath in
the meat business, one in the real estate business, one clerking in a
store, and two, a blind man and his wife, fairly prosperous Osteopathic
physicians.This was along one short line of railroad, and there is no
reason why it may not be taken as a sample of the percentage of those who
have quit in the entire country.I heard three years ago from a bright young man who graduated with honors,
started out with luxurious office rooms in a flourishing city, and was
pointed to as an example of the prosperity that comes to the Osteopath
from the very start.When I heard from him last he was advance
bill-poster for a cheap show.Another bright classmate was carrying a
chain for surveyors in California.I received an Osteopathic journal recently containing a list of names,
about eight hundred of them, of "mossbacks," as we were politely called.I
say "we," for my name was on the list.The journal said these were the
names of Osteopaths whose addresses were lost and no communication could
be had with them.Just for what, aside
from the annual fee to the American Osteopathic Association, was not
clear.I do know what the silence of a good many of them meant.They have quit,
and do not care to read the abuse that some of the Osteopathic journals
are continually heaping upon those who do not keep their names on the
"Who's Who in Osteopathy" list.There is a large percentage of failures in other professions, and it is
not strange that there should be some in Osteopathy.But when Osteopathic
journals dwell upon the large chances of success and prosperity for those
who choose Osteopathy as a profession, those who might become students
should know the other side.THE OSTEOPATHIC PROPAGANDA.Wonderful Growth Claimed to Prove Merit--Osteopathy is Rational
    Physio-Therapy--Growth is in Exact Proportion to Advertising
    Received--Booklets and Journals for Gratuitous
    Distribution--Osteopathy Languishes or Flourishes by Patent Medicine
    Devices--Circular Letter from Secretary of American Osteopathic
    Association--Boosts by Governors and Senators--The Especial Protege of
    Authors--Mark Twain--Opie Reed--Emerson Hough--Sam Jones--The
    Orificial Surgeon--The M.D.Seeking Job as "Professor"--The Lure of
    "Honored Doctor" with "Big Income"--No Competition.Why has it had such a wonderful growth in
popularity?Why have nearly four thousand men and women, most of them
intelligent and some of them educated, espoused it as a profession to
follow as a life work?These are questions I shall now try to answer.Osteopathic promoters and enthusiasts claim that the wonderful growth and
popularity of Osteopathy prove beyond question its merits as a healing
system.I have already dealt at length with reasons why intelligent people
are so ready to fall victims to new systems of healing.The "perfect
adjustment," "perfect functioning" theory of Osteopathy is especially
attractive to people made ripe for some "drugless healing" system by
causes already mentioned.When Osteopathy is practiced as a combination of
all manipulations and other natural aids to the inherent recuperative
powers of the body, it will appeal to reason in such a way and bring such
good results as to make and keep friends.I am fully persuaded, and I believe the facts when presented will
establish it, that it is the physio-therapy in Osteopathy that wins and
holds the favor of intelligent people.But Osteopathy in its own name,
taught as "a well-rounded system of healing adequate for every emergency,"
has grown and spread largely as a "patent medicine" flourishes, _i.e._,
in exact proportion to the advertising it has received.I would not
presume to make this statement as merely my opinion.The question at issue
is too important to be treated as a matter of opinion.I will present
facts, and let my readers settle the point in their own minds.Every week I get booklets or "sample copies" of journals heralding the
wonderful curative powers of Osteopathy.These are published not as
journals for professional reading, but to be sold to the practitioners by
the hundreds or thousands, to be given to their patients for distribution
by these patients to their friends.The publishers of these "boosters"
say, and present testimonials to prove it, that Osteopaths find their
practice languishes or flourishes just in proportion to the numbers of
these journals and booklets they keep circulating in their communities.Here is a sample testimonial I received some time since on a postal card:

    "Gentlemen: Since using your journals more patients have come to me
    than I could treat, many of them coming from neighboring towns.Quite
    a number have had to go home without being treated, leaving their
    names so that they could be notified later, as I can get to them.Your
    booklets bring them O.The boast is often made that Osteopathy is growing in spite of bitter
opposition and persecution, and is doing it on its merits--doing it
because "Truth is mighty and will prevail."At one time I honestly
believed this to be true, but I have been convinced by highest Osteopathic
authority that it is not true.As some of that proof here is an extract
from a circular letter from the secretary of the American Osteopathic
Association:

    "Now, Doctor, we feel that you have the success of Osteopathy at
    heart, and if you realize the activity and complete organization of
    the American Medical Association and their efforts to curb our
    limitations, and do not become a member of this Association, which
    stands opposed to the efforts of the big monopoly, we must believe
    that you are not familiar with the earnestness of the A. O. A. and its
    efforts.We must work in harmonious accord and with an organized
    purpose._When we rest on our oars the death knell begins to sound._
    Can you not see that unless you co-operate with your
    fellow-practitioners in this national effort you are _sounding your
    own limitations_?"This from the _secretary_ of the American Osteopathic Association, when we
have boasted of superior equipment for intelligent physicians.Incidentally we pause to make excuse for the expressions: "Curbing our
limitations" and "sounding your own limitations."But does the idea that when we quit working as an organized body "_our
death knell begins to sound_," indicate that Osteopathic leaders are
content to trust the future of Osteopathy to its merits?If Osteopathic promoters do not feel that the life of their science
depends on boosting, what did the secretary of the A.O.A.mean when he
said, "Upon the success of these efforts depends the weal or woe of
Osteopathy as an independent system"?If truth always grows under
persecution, how can the American Medical Association kill Osteopathy when
it is so well known by the people?Nearly four thousand Osteopaths are scattered in thirty-six States where
they have some legal recognition, and they are treating thousands of
invalids every day.If they are performing the wonderful cures Osteopathic
journals tell of, why are we told that the welfare of the system depends
upon the noise that is made and the boosting that is done?Has it required advertising to keep people using anesthetics since it was
demonstrated that they would prevent pain?Has it required boosting to keep the people resorting to surgery since the
benefits of modern operations have been proved?Does it look as if Osteopathy has been standing or advancing on its
merits?Does it not seem that Osteopathy, as a complete system, is mostly
a _name_, and "lives, moves, and has its being" in boosting?It seems to
have been about the best boosted fad ever fancied by a foolish people.Osteopathic journals have
published again and again the nice things a number of governors said when
they signed the bills investing Osteopathy with the dignity of State
authority.A certain United States senator from Ohio has won more notoriety as a
champion of Osteopathy than he has lasting fame as a statesman.Osteopathy has been the especial protege of authors.Mark Twain once went
up to Albany and routed an army of medical lobbyists who were there to
resist the passage of a bill favorable to Osteopathy.For this heroic deed
Mark is better known to Osteopaths to-day than even for his renowned
history of Huckleberry Finn.He is in danger of losing his reputation as a
champion of the "under dog in the fight."Lately he has gone on the
warpath again.This time to annihilate poor Mother Eddy and her fond
delusion.Opie Reed is a delightful writer while he sticks to the portrayal of droll
Southern character.Ella Wheeler Wilcox is admirable for the beauty and
boldness with which she portrays the passions and emotions of humanity.But they are both better known to Osteopaths for the bouquets they have
tossed at Osteopathy than for their profound human philosophy that used to
be promulgated by the _Chicago American_.Emerson Hough gave a little free advertising in his "Heart's Desire."There may have been "method in his madness," for that Osteopathic horse
doctoring scene no doubt sold many a book for the author.Sam Jones also helped along with some of his striking originality.Sam
said, "There is as much difference between Osteopathy and massage as
between playing a piano and currying a horse."The idea of comparing the
Osteopath's manipulations of the human body to the skilled touch of the
pianist upon his instrument was especially pleasing to Osteopaths.However, Sam displayed about the same comprehension of his subject that
preachers usually exhibit who try to say nice things about the doctors
when they get their doctoring gratis or at reduced rates.These champions of Osteopathy no doubt mean well.They can be excused on
the ground that they got out of place to aid in the cause of "struggling
truth."But what shall we say of medical men, some of them of reputation
and great influence, who uphold and champion new systems under such
conditions that it is questionable whether they do it from principle or
policy?Osteopathic journals have made much of an article written by a famous
"orificial surgeon."The article appears on the first page of a leading
Osteopath journal, and is headed, "An Expert Opinion on Osteopathy."Among
the many good things he says of the "new science" is this: "The full
benefit of a single sitting can be secured in from three to ten minutes
instead of an hour or more, as required by massage."I shall discuss the
time of an average Osteopathic treatment further on, but I should like to
see how long this brother would hold his practice if he were an Osteopath
and treated from three to ten minutes.He also says that "Osteopathy is so beneficial to cases of insanity that
it seems quite probable that this large class of terrible sufferers may be
almost emancipated from their hell."I shall also say more further on of
what I know of Osteopathy's record as an insanity cure.There is this
significant thing in connection with this noted specialist's boost for
Osteopathy.The journal printing this article comments on it in another
number; tells what a great man the specialist is, and incidentally lets
Osteopaths know that if any of them want to add a knowledge of "orificial
surgery" to their "complete science," this doctor is the man from whom to
get it, as he is the "great and only" in his specialty, and is big and
broad enough to appreciate Osteopathy.The most despicable booster of any new system of therapeutics is the
physician who becomes its champion to get a job as "professor" in one of
its colleges.Of course it is a strong temptation to a medical man who has
never made much of a reputation in his own profession.You may ask, "Have there been many such medical men?"Consult the faculty
rolls of the colleges of these new sciences, and you will be surprised, no
doubt, to find how many put M.D.Some of these were honest converts to the system, perhaps.Some wanted
the honor of being "Professor Doctor," maybe, and some may have been lured
by the same bait that attracts so many students into Osteopathic colleges.That is, the positive assurance of "plenty of easy money" in it.One who has studied the real situation in an effort to learn why
Osteopathy has grown so fast as a profession, can hardly miss the
conclusion that advertising keeps the grist of students pouring into
Osteopathic mills.There is scarcely a corner of the United States that
their seductive literature does not reach.Practitioners in the field are
continually reminded by the schools from which they graduated that their
alma mater looks largely to their solicitations to keep up the supply of
recruits.Their advertising, the tales of wonderful cures and big money made, appeal
to all classes.It seems that none are too scholarly and none too ignorant
to become infatuated with the idea of becoming an "honored doctor" with a
"big income."College professors and preachers have been lured from
comfortable positions to become Osteopaths.Shrewd traveling men, seduced
by the picture of a permanent home, have left the road to become
Osteopathic physicians and be "rich and honored."To me, when a student of Osteopathy, it was
pathetic and almost tragic to observe the crowds of men and women who had
been seduced from spheres of drudging usefulness, such as clerking,
teaching, barbering, etc., to become money-making doctors.In their old
callings they had lost all hope of gratifying ambition for fame and
fortune, but were making an honest living.The rosy pictures of honor,
fame and twenty dollars per day, that the numerous Osteopathic circulars
and journals painted, were not to be withstood.These circulars told them that the fields into which they might go and
reap that $20 per day were unlimited.They said: "There are dozens of
ministers ready to occupy each vacant pulpit, and as many applicants for
each vacancy in the schools.Each hamlet has four or five doctors, where
it can support but one.The legal profession is filled to the starving
point.Young licentiates in the older professions all have to pass through
a starving time.The
picture was a rosy dream of triumphant success!When they had mastered the
great science and become "Doctors of Osteopathy," the world was waiting
with open arms and pocketbooks to receive them.THEORY AND PRACTICE OF OSTEOPATHY.Infallible, Touch-the-Button System that Always Cured--Indefinite
    Movements and Manipulations--Wealth of Undeveloped Scientific
    Facts--Osteopaths Taking M.D.Course--The Standpatter and the
    Drifter--The "Lesionist"--"Bone Setting"--"Inhibiting a
    Center"--Chiropractics--"Finest Anatomists in the World"--How to Cure
    Torticollis, Goitre and Enteric Troubles--A Successful
    Osteopath--Timid Old Maids--Osteopathic Philanthropy.Many of them were men and women
with gray heads, who had found themselves stranded at a time of life when
they should have been able to retire on a competency.They had staked
their little all on this last venture, and what was before them if they
should fail heaven only knew.How eagerly they looked forward to the time
when they should have struggled through the lessons in anatomy, chemistry,
physiology, symptomatology and all the rest, and should be ready to
receive the wonderful principles of Osteopathy they were to apply in
performing the miraculous cures that were to make them wealthy and famous.Need I tell the physician who was a conscientious student of anatomy in
his school days, that there was disappointment when the time came to enter
the class in "theory and practice" of Osteopathy?There had been vague ideas of a systematized, infallible, touch-the-button
system that _always_ cured.Instead, we were instructed in a lot of
indefinite movements and manipulations that somehow left us speculating as
to just how much of it all was done for effect.We had heard so often that Osteopathy was a complete satisfying science
_that did things specifically_!Now it began to dawn upon us that there
was indeed a "wealth of undeveloped scientific facts" in Osteopathy, as
those glittering circulars had said when they thought to attract young men
ambitious for original research.They had said, "Much yet remains to be
discovered."Some of us wondered if the "undeveloped" and "undiscovered"
scientific facts were not the main constituents of the "science."The students expected something exact and tangible, and how eagerly they
grasped at anything in the way of bringing quick results in curing the
sick.If Osteopathy is so complete, why did so many students, after they had
received everything the learned (?)professors had to impart, procure
Juettner's "Modern Physio-Therapy" and Ling's "Manual Therapy" and Rosse's
"Cures Without Drugs" and Kellogg's work on "Hydrotherapy"?They felt that
they needed all they could get.It was customary for the students to begin "treating" after they had been
in school a few months, and medical men will hardly be surprised to know
that they worked with more faith in their healing powers and performed
more wonderful (?)cures in their freshman year than they ever did
afterward.I have in mind a student, one of the brightest I ever met, who read a
cheap book on Osteopathic practice, went into a community where he was
unknown, and practiced as an Osteopathic physician.In a few months he had
made enough money to pay his way through an Osteopathic college, which he
entered professing to believe that Osteopathy would cure all the ills
flesh is heir to, but which he left two years later to take a medical
course.degree, but I notice that it is his M.D.Can students be blamed for getting a little weak in faith when men who
told them that the great principles of Osteopathy were sufficient to cure
_everything_, have been known to backslide so far as to go and take
medical courses themselves?How do you suppose it affects students of an Osteopathic college to read
in a representative journal that the secretary of their school, and the
greatest of all its boosters, calls medical men into his own family when
there is sickness in it?There are many men and women practicing to-day who try to be honest and
conscientious, and by using all the good in Osteopathy, massage, Swedish
movements, hydrotherapy, and all the rest of the adjuncts of
physio-therapy, do a great deal of good.The practitioner who does use
these agencies, however, is denounced by the stand-patters as a "drifter."They say he is not a true Osteopath, but a mongrel who is belittling the
great science.That circular letter from the secretary of the American
Osteopathic Association said that one of the greatest needs of
organization was to preserve Osteopathy in its primal purity as it came
from its founder, A. T. Still.If our medical brethren and the laity could read some of the acrimonious
discussions on the question of using adjuncts, they would certainly be
impressed with the exactness (?)There is one idea of Osteopathy that even the popular mind has grasped,
and that is that it is essentially finding "lesions" and correcting them.Yet the question has been very prominent and pertinent among Osteopaths:
"Are you a lesion Osteopath?"Think of it, gentlemen, asking an Osteopath
if he is a "lesionist"!Yet there are plenty of Osteopaths who are stupid
enough (or honest enough) not to be able to find bones "subluxed" every
time they look at a patient.Practitioners who really want to do their
patrons good will use adjuncts even if they are denounced by the
stand-patters.I believe every conscientious Osteopath must sometimes feel that it is
safer to use rational remedies than to rely on "bone setting," or
"inhibiting a center," but for the grafter it is not so spectacular and
involves more hard work.The stand-patters of the American Osteopathic Association have not
eliminated all trouble when they get Osteopaths to stick to the "bone
setting, inhibiting" idea.The chiropractic man threatens to steal their
thunder here.The Chiropractor has found that when it comes to using
mysterious maneuvers and manipulations as bases for mind cure, one thing
is about as good as another, except that the more mysterious a thing
looks the better it works.So the Chiropractor simply gives his healing
"thrusts" or his wonderful "adjustments," touches the buttons along the
spine as it were, when--presto!disease has flown before his healing touch
and blessed health has come to reign instead!The Osteopath denounces the Chiropractor as a brazen fraud who has stolen
all that is good in Chiropractics (if there _is_ anything good) from
Osteopathy.But Chiropractics follows so closely what the "old liner"
calls the true theory of Osteopathy that, between him and the drifter who
gives an hour of crude massage, or uses the forbidden accessories, the
true Osteopath has a hard time maintaining the dignity (?)of Osteopathy
and keeping its practitioners from drifting.Some of the most ardent supporters of true Osteopathy I have ever known
have drifted entirely away from it.After practicing two or three years,
abusing medicine and medical men all the time, and proclaiming to the
people continually that they had in Osteopathy all that a sick world could
ever need, it is suddenly learned that the "Osteopath is gone."He has
"silently folded his tent and stolen away," and where has he gone?He has
gone to a medical college to study that same medicine he has so
industriously abused while he was gathering in the shekels as an
Osteopath.Going to learn and practice the science he has so persistently
denounced as a fraud and a curse to humanity.The intelligent, conscientious Osteopath who dares to brave the scorn of
the stand-patter and use all the legitimate adjuncts of Osteopathy found
in physio-therapy, may do a great deal of good as a physician.I have
found many physicians willing to acknowledge this, and even recommend the
services of such an Osteopath when physio-therapy was indicated.When a physician, however, meets a fellow who claims to have in his
Osteopathy a wonderful system, complete and all-sufficient to cope with
any and all diseases, and that his system is founded on a knowledge of the
relation and function of the various parts and organs of the body such as
no other school of therapeutics has ever been able to discover, then he
knows that he has met a man of the same mental and moral calibre as the
shyster in his own school.He knows he has met a fellow who is exploiting
a thing, that may be good in its way and place, as a graft.And he knows
that this grafter gets his wonderful cures largely as any other quack gets
his; the primary effects of his "scientific manipulations" are on the
minds of those treated.The intelligent physician knows that the Osteopath got his boastedly
superior knowledge of anatomy mostly from the same text-books and same
class of cadavers that other physicians had to master if they graduated
from a reputable school.All that talk we have heard so much about the
Osteopaths being the "finest anatomists in the world" sounds plausible,
and is believed by the laity generally.The quotation I gave above has been much used in Osteopathic literature
as coming from an eminent medical man.What foundation is there for such a
belief?The Osteopath _may_ be a good anatomist.He has about the same
opportunities to learn anatomy the medical student has.If he is a good
and conscientious student he may consider his anatomy of more importance
than does the medical student who is not expecting to do much surgery.If
he is a natural shyster and shirk he can get through a course in
Osteopathy and get his diploma, and this diploma may be about the only
proof he could ever give that he is a "superior anatomist."Great stress has always been laid by Osteopaths upon the amount of study
and research done by their students on the cadaver.I want to give you
some specimens of the learning of the man (an M.D.)who presided over the
dissecting-room when I pursued my "profound research" on the "lateral
half."This great man, whose superior knowledge of anatomy, I presume,
induced by the wise management of the college to employ him as a
demonstrator, in an article written for the organ of the school expresses
himself thus:

    "It is needless to say that the first impression of an M. D. would not
    be favorable to Osteopathy, because he has spent years fixing in his
    mind that if you had a bad case of torticollis not to touch it, but
    give a man morphine or something of the same character with an
    external blister or hot application and in a week or ten days he would
    be all right.In the meanwhile watch the patient's general health,
    relieve the induced constipation by suitable means and rearrange what
    he has disarranged in his treatment.On the other hand, let the
    Osteopath get hold of this patient, and with his _vast_ and we might
    say _perfect_ knowledge of anatomy, he at once, with no other tools
    than his hands, inhibits the nerves supplying the affected parts, and
    in five minutes the patient can freely move his head and shoulders,
    entirely relieved from pain.Would
    he not feel like wiping off the earth with all the Osteopaths?Doctor,
    with your medical education a course in Osteopathy would teach you
    that it is not necessary to subject your patients to myxedema by
    removing the thyroid gland to cure goitre.You would not have to lie
    awake nights studying means to stop one of those troublesome bowel
    complaints in children, nor to insist upon the enforced diet in
    chronic diarrhea, and a thousand other things which are purely
    physiological and are not done by any magical presto change, but by
    methods which are perfectly rational if you will only listen long
    enough to have them explained to you.I will agree that at first
    impression all methods look alike to the medical man, but when
    explained by an intelligent teacher they will bring their just
    reward."Gentlemen of the medical profession, study the above
carefully--punctuation, composition, profound wisdom and all.Surely you
did not read it when it was given to the world a few years ago, or you
would all have been converted to Osteopathy then, and the medical
profession left desolate.We have heard many bad things of medical men,
but never (until we learned it from one who was big-brained enough to
accept Osteopathy when its great truths dawned upon him) did we know that
you are so dull of intellect that it takes you "years to fix in your minds
that if you had a bad case of torticollis not to touch it but to give a
man morphine."And how pleased Osteopaths are to learn from this scholar that the
Osteopath can "take hold" of a case of torticollis, "and with his vast and
we might say perfect knowledge of anatomy" inhibit the nerves and have the
man cured in five minutes.We were glad to learn this great truth from
this learned ex-M.D., as we never should have known, otherwise, that
Osteopathy is so potent.I have had cases of torticollis in my practice, and thought I had done
well if after a half hour of hard work massaging contracted muscles I had
benefited the case.And note the relevancy of these questions, "Would not the medical man be
angry?Would he not feel like wiping off the earth all the Osteopaths?"Gentlemen, can you explain your ex-brother's meaning here?Surely you are
not all so hard-hearted that you would be angry because a poor wry-necked
fellow had been cured in five minutes.To be serious, I ask you to think of "the finest anatomists in the world"
doing their "original research" work in the dissecting-room under the
direction of a man of the scholarly attainments indicated by the
composition and thought of the above article.Do you see now how
Osteopaths get a "vast and perfect knowledge of anatomy"?Do you suppose that the law of "the survival of the fittest" determines
who continues in the practice of Osteopathy and succeeds?Is it true worth
and scholarly ability that get a big reputation of success among medical
men?I know, and many medical men know from competition with him (if they
would admit that such a fellow may be a competitor), that the ignoramus
who as a physician is the product of a diploma mill often has a bigger
reputation and performs more wonderful cures (?)than the educated
Osteopath who really mastered the prescribed course but is too
conscientious to assume responsibility for human life when he is not sure
that he can do all that might be done to save life.I once met an Osteopath whose literary attainments had never reached the
rudiments of an education.He had never really comprehended a single
lesson of his entire course.He told me that he was then on a vacation to
get much-needed rest.He had such a large practice that the physical labor
of it was wearing him out.I knew of this fellow's qualifications, but I
thought he might be one of those happy mortals who have the faculty of
"doing things," even if they cannot learn the theory.To learn the secret
of this fellow's success, if I could, I let him treat me.I had some
contracted muscles that were irritating nerves and holding joints in tense
condition, a typical case, if there are any, for an Osteopathic treatment.I expected him to do some of that
"expert Osteopathic diagnosing" that you have heard of, but he began in an
aimless desultory way, worked almost an hour, found nothing specific, did
nothing but give me a poor unsystematic massage.He was giving me a
"popular treatment."In many towns people have come to estimate the value of an Osteopathic
treatment by its duration.People used to say to me, "You don't treat as
long as Dr.----, who was here before you," and say it in a way indicating
that they were hardly satisfied they had gotten their money's worth.Some
of them would say: "He treated me an hour for seventy-five cents."Does it
seem funny to talk of adjusting lesions on one person for an hour at a
time, three times a week?My picture of incompetency and apparent success of incompetents, is not
overdrawn.The other day I had a marked copy of a local paper from a town
in California.It was a flattering write-up of an old classmate.The
doctor's automobile was mentioned, and he had marked with a cross a fine
auto shown in a picture of the city garage.This fellow had been
considered by all the Simple Simon of the class, inferior in almost every
attribute of true manliness, yet now he flourishes as one of those of our
class to whose success the school can "point with pride."It is interesting to read the long list of "changes of location" among
Osteopaths, yet between the lines there is a sad story that may be read.First, "Doctor Blank has located
in Philadelphia, with twenty-five patients for the first month and rapidly
growing practice."A year or so after another item tells that "Doctor
Blank has located in San Francisco with bright prospects."Then "Doctor
Blank has returned to Missouri on account of his wife's health, and
located in ----, where he has our best wishes for success."Their career
reminds us of Goldsmith's lines:

  "As the hare whom horn and hounds pursue
  Pants to the place from whence at first he flew."There has been many a tragic scene enacted upon the Osteopathic stage, but
the curtain has not been raised for the public to behold them.How many
timid old maids, after saving a few hundred dollars from wages received
for teaching school, have been persuaded that they could learn Osteopathy
while their shattered nerves were repaired and they were made young and
beautiful once more by a course of treatment in the clinics of the school.Then they would be ready to go out to occupy a place of dignity and honor,
and treat ten to thirty patients per month at twenty-five dollars per
patient.Gentlemen of the medical profession, from what you know of the aggressive
spirit that it takes to succeed in professional life to-day (to say
nothing of the physical strength required in the practice of Osteopathy),
what per cent.of these timid old maids do you suppose have "panted to the
place from whence at first they flew," after leaving their pitiful little
savings with the benefactors of humanity who were devoting their splendid
talents to the cause of Osteopathy?If any one doubts that some Osteopathic schools are conducted from other
than philanthropic motives, let him read what the _Osteopathic Physician_
said of a new school founded in California.Of all the fraud, bare-faced
shystering, and flagrant rascality ever exposed in any profession, the
circumstances of the founding of this school, as depicted by the editor of
the _Osteopathic Physician_, furnishes the most disgusting instance.Men
to whom we had clung when the anchor of our faith in Osteopathy seemed
about to drag were held up before us as sneaking, cringing, incompetent
rascals, whose motives in founding the school were commercial in the worst
sense.And how do you suppose Osteopaths out in the field of practice feel
when they receive catalogues from the leading colleges that teach their
system, and these catalogues tell of the superior education the colleges
are equipped to give, and among the pictures of learned members of the
faculty they recognize the faces of old schoolmates, with glasses, pointed
beards and white ties, silk hats maybe, but the same old classmate
of--sometimes not ordinary ability.I spoke a moment ago of old maids being induced to believe that they would
be made over in the clinics of an Osteopathic college.An Osteopathic journal before me says: "If it were generally
known that Osteopathy has a wonderfully rejuvenating effect upon fading
beauty, Osteopathic physicians would be overworked as beauty doctors."Another journal says: "If the aged could know how many years might be
added to their lives by Osteopathy, they would not hesitate to avail
themselves of treatment."A leading D. O. discusses consumption as treated Osteopathically, and
closes his discussion with the statement in big letters: "CONSUMPTION CAN
BE CURED."Another Osteopathic doctor says the curse that was placed upon Mother Eve
in connection with the propagation of the race has been removed by
Osteopathy, and childbirth "positively painless" is a consummated fact.The insane emancipated from
their hell!Asthma
cured by moving a bone!What more in therapeutics is left to be desired?CHAPTER X.

OSTEOPATHY AS RELATED TO SOME OTHER FAKES.Sure Shot Rheumatism Cure--Regular Practitioner's
    Discomfiture--Medicines Alone Failed to Cure Rheumatism--Osteopathy
    Relieves Rheumatic and Neuralgic Pains--"Move Things"--"Pop" Stray
    Cervical Vertebrae--Find Something Wrong and Put it Right--Terrible
    Neck-Wrenching, Bone-Twisting Ordeal.A discussion of graft in connection with doctoring would not be complete
if nothing were said about the traveling medicine faker.Every summer our
towns are visited by smooth-tongued frauds who give free shows on the
streets.They harangue the people by the hour with borrowed spiels, full
of big medical terms, and usually full of abuse of regular practitioners,
which local physicians must note with humiliation is too often received by
people without resentment and often with applause.Only last summer I was standing by while one of these grafters was making
his spiel, and gathering dollars by the pocketful for a "sure shot"
rheumatism cure.His was a _sure_ cure, doubly guaranteed; no cure, money
all refunded (if you could get it).A physician standing near laughed
rather a mirthless laugh, and remarked that Barnum was right when he said,
"The American people like to be humbugged."When the medical man left, a
man who had just become the happy possessor of enough of the wonderful
herb to make a quart of the rheumatism router, remarked: "He couldn't be a
worse humbug than that old duffer.He doctored me for six weeks, and told
me all the time that his medicine would cure me in a few days.I got worse
all the time until I went to Dr.----, who told me to use a sack of hot
bran mash on my back, and I was able to get around in two days."In this man's remarks there is an explanation of the reason the crowd
laughed when they heard the quack abusing the regular practitioner, and of
the reason the people handed their hard-earned dollars to the grafter at
the rate of forty in ten minutes, by actual count.If all doctors were
honest and told the people what all authorities have agreed upon about
rheumatism, _i.e._, that internal medication does it little good, and the
main reliance must be on external application, traveling and patent
medicine fakers who make a specialty of rheumatism cure would be "put out
of business," and there would be eliminated one source of much loss of
faith in medicine.I learned by experience as an Osteopath that many people lose faith in
medicine and in the honesty of physicians because of the failure of
medicine to cure rheumatism where the physician had promised a cure.Patients afflicted with other diseases get well anyway, or the sexton puts
them where they cannot tell people of the physician's failure to cure
them.The rheumatic patient lives on, and talks on of "Doc's" failure to
stop his rheumatic pains.All doctors know that rheumatism is the
universal disease of our fickle climate.If it were not for rheumatic
pains, and neuralgic pains that often come from nerves irritated by
contracted muscles, the Osteopath in the average country town would get
more lonesome than he does.People who are otherwise skeptical concerning
the merits of Osteopathy will admit that it seems rational treatment for
rheumatism.Yet this is a disease that Osteopathy of the specific-adjustment,
bone-setting, nerve-inhibiting brand has little beneficial effect upon.All the Osteopathic treatments I ever gave or saw given in cases of
rheumatism that really did any good, were long, laborious massages.The
medical man who as "professor" in an Osteopathic college said, "When the
Osteopath with his _vast_ knowledge of anatomy gets hold of a case of
torticollis he inhibits the nerves and cures it in five minutes," was
talking driveling rot.I have seen some of the best Osteopaths treat wry-neck, and the work they
did was to knead and stretch and pull, which by starting circulation and
working out soreness, gradually relieved the patient.A hot application,
by expanding tissues and stimulating circulation, would have had the same
effect, perhaps more slowly manifested.To call any Osteopathic treatment massage is always resented as an insult
by the guardians of the science.What is the Osteopath doing, who rolls
and twists and pulls and kneads for a full hour, if he isn't giving a
massage treatment?Of course, it sounds more dignified, and perhaps helps
to "preserve the purity of Osteopathy as a separate system," to call it
"reducing subluxations," "correcting lesions," "inhibiting and
stimulating" nerves.The treatment also acts better as a placebo to call
it by these names.As students we were taught that all Osteopathic movements were primarily
to adjust something.Some of us worried for fear we wouldn't know when the
adjusting was complete.We were told that all the movements we were taught
to make were potent to "move things," so we worried again for fear we
might move something in the wrong direction.We were assured, however,
that since the tendency was always toward the normal, all we had to do was
to agitate, stir things up a bit, and the thing out of place would find
its place.We were told that when in the midst of our "agitation" we heard something
"pop," we could be sure the thing out of place had gone back.When a
student had so mastered the great bone-setting science as to be able to
"pop" stray cervical vertebrae he was looked upon with envy by the fellows
who had not joined the association for protection against suits for
malpractice, and did not know just how much of an owl they could make of a
man and not break his neck.The fellow who lacked clairvoyant powers to locate straying things, and
could not always find the "missing link" of the spine, could go through
the prescribed motions just the same.If he could do it with sufficient
facial contortions to indicate supreme physical exertion, and at the same
time preserve the look of serious gravity and professional importance of a
quack medical doctor giving _particular_ directions for the dosing of the
placebo he is leaving, he might manage to make a sound vertebra "pop."This, with his big show of doing something, has its effect on the
patient's mind anyway.We were taught that Osteopathy was applied common sense, that it was all
reasonable and rational, and simply meant "finding something wrong and
putting it right."Some of us thought it only fair to tell our patients
what we were trying to do, and what we did it for.There is where we made
our big mistake.To say we were relaxing muscles, or trying to lift and
tone up a rickety chest wall, or straighten a warped spine, was altogether
too simple.It was like telling a man that you were going to give him a
dose of oil for the bellyache when he wanted an operation for
appendicitis.It was too common, and some would go to an Osteopath who
could find vertebra and ribs and hips displaced, something that would make
the community "sit up and take notice."If one has to be sick, why not
have something worth while?Where Osteopathy has always been so administered that people have the idea
that it means to find things out of place and put them back, it is a
gentleman's job, professional, scientific and genteel.Men have been known
to give twenty to forty treatments a day at two dollars per treatment.In
many communities, however, the adjustment idea has so degenerated that to
give an Osteopathic treatment is no job for a high collar on a hot day.To
strip a hard-muscled, two-hundred-pound laborer down to a
perspiration-soaked and scented undershirt, and manipulate him for an hour
while he has every one of his five hundred work-hardened muscles rigidly
set to protect himself from the terrible neck-wrenching, bone-twisting
ordeal he has been told an Osteopathic treatment would subject him to--I
say when you have tried that sort of a thing for an hour you will conclude
that an Osteopathic treatment is no job for a kid-gloved dandy nor for a
lily-fingered lady, as it has been so glowingly pictured.I know the brethren will say that true Osteopathy does not give an hour's
shotgun treatment, but finds the lesion, corrects it, collects its two
dollars, and quits until "day after to-morrow," when it "corrects" and
_collects_ again as long as there is anything to co--llect!I practiced for three years in a town where people made their first
acquaintance with Osteopathy through the treatments of a man who
afterwards held the position of demonstrator of Osteopathic "movements"
and "manipulations" in one of the largest and boastedly superior schools
of Osteopathy.The people certainly should have received correct ideas of
Osteopathy from him.He was followed in the town by a bright young fellow
from "Pap's" school, where the genuine "lesion," blown-in-the-bottle brand
of Osteopathy has always been taught.This fellow was such an excellent
Osteopath that he made enough money in two years to enable him to quit
Osteopathy forever.This he did, using the money he had gathered as an
Osteopath to take him through a medical college.I followed these two shining lights who I supposed had established
Osteopathy on a correct basis.I started in to give specific treatments as
I had been taught to do; that is, to hunt for the lesion, correct it if I
found it, and quit, even if I had not been more than fifteen or twenty
minutes at it.I found that in many cases my patients were not satisfied.I did not know just what was the matter at first, and lost some desirable
patients (lost their patronage, I mean--they were not in much danger of
dying when they came to me).I was soon enlightened, however, by some more
outspoken than the rest.They said I did not "treat as long as that other
doctor," and when I had done what I thought was indicated at times a
patient would say, "You didn't give me that neck-twisting movement," or
that "leg-pulling treatment."No matter what I thought was indicated, I
had to give all the movements each time that had ever been given before.A physician who has had to dose out something he knew would do no good,
just to satisfy the patient and keep him from sending for another doctor
who he feared might give something worse, can appreciate the violence done
a fellow's conscience as he administers those wonderfully curative
movements.He cannot, however, appreciate the emotions that come from the
strenuous exertion over a sweaty body in a close room on a July day.Incidentally, this difference in the physical exertion necessary to get
the same results has determined a good many to quit Osteopathy and take up
medicine.A young man who had almost completed a course in Osteopathy told
me he was going to study medicine when he had finished Osteopathy, as he
had found that giving "treatments was too d----d hard work."TAPEWORMS AND GALLSTONES.Plug-hatted Faker--Frequency of Tapeworms--Some Tricks Exposed--How
    the Defunct Worm was Passed--Rubber Near-Worm--New Gallstone
    Cure--Relation to Osteopathy--Perfect, Self-Oiling, "Autotherapeutic"
    Machine--Touch the Button--The Truth About the Consumption and
    Insanity Cures.There is another trump card the traveling medical grafter plays, which
wins about as well as the guaranteed rheumatism cure, namely, the tapeworm
fraud.Last summer I heard a plug-hatted faker delivering a lecture to a
street crowd, in which he said that every mother's son or daughter of them
who didn't have the rosy cheek, the sparkling eye and buoyancy of youth
might be sure that a tapeworm of monstrous size was, "like a worm in the
bud," feeding on their "damask cheeks."To prove his assertion and lend
terror to his tale, he held aloft a glass jar containing one of the
monsters that had been driven from its feast on the vitals of its victim
by his never-failing remedy.The person, "saved from a living death,"
stood at the "doctor's" side to corroborate the story, while his
voluptuous wife was kept busy handing out the magical remedy and "pursing
the ducats" given in return.How this one was secured I do not know; but
intelligent people ought to know that cases of tapeworm are not so common
that eight people out of every ten have one, as this grafter positively
asserted.An acquaintance once traveled with one of these tapeworm specialists to
furnish the song and dance performances that are so attractive to the
class of people who furnish the ready victims for grafters.The "specialist" would pick out an emaciated,
credulous individual from his crowd, and tell him that he bore the
unmistakable marks of being the prey of a terrible tapeworm.If he
couldn't sell him a bottle of his worm eradicator, he would give him a
bottle, telling him to take it according to directions and report to him
at his hotel or tent the next day.The man would report that no dead or
dying worm had been sighted.The man was told that if he had taken the medicine as directed the
worm was dead beyond a doubt, but sometimes the "fangs" were fastened so
firmly to the walls of the intestines, in their death agony, that they
would not come away until he had injected a certain preparation that
_always_ "produced the goods."The man was taken into a darkened room for privacy (?), the injection
given, and the defunct worm always came away.At least a worm was always
found in the evacuated material, and how was the deluded one to know that
it was in the vessel or matter injected?Of course, the patient felt
wondrous relief, and was glad to stand up that night and testify that Dr.Grafter was an angel of mercy sent to deliver him from the awful fate of
living where "the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched."I was told recently of a new tapeworm graft that makes the old one look
crude and unscientific.This one actually brings a tapeworm from the
intestines in _every_ case, whether the person had one before the magic
remedy was given or not.The graft is to have a near-worm manufactured of
delicate rubber and compressed into a capsule.The patient swallows the
capsule supposed to contain the worm destroyer.The rubber worm is not
digested, and a strong physic soon produces it, to the great relief of the
"patient" and the greater glory and profit of the shyster.What a
wonderful age of invention and scientific discoveries!Another journal tells of a new gallstone cure that never fails to cause
the stones to be passed even if they are big as walnuts.The graft in this
is that the medicine consists of paraffine dissolved in  oil.The
paraffine does not digest, but collects in  balls, which are passed
by handfuls and are excellent imitations of the real things.How about tapeworms, gallstones and Osteopathy, do you ask?We heard about tapeworms and gallstones when we were in Osteopathic
college.The one thing that was ground into us early and thoroughly was that
Osteopathy was a complete system.No matter what any other system had
done, we were to remember that Osteopathy could do that thing more surely
and more scientifically.Students soon learned that they were never to ask, "_Can_ we treat this?"That indicated skepticism, which was intolerable in the atmosphere of
optimistic faith that surrounded the freshman and sophomore classes
especially.The question was to be put, "_How_ do we treat this?"In the
treatment of worms the question was, "How do we treat worms?"Had not nature made a machine, perfect in all its parts,
self-oiling, "autotherapeutic," and all that?And would nature allow it to
choke up or slip a cog just because a little thing like a worm got tangled
in its gearing?Nature knew that worms would intrude, and had
provided her own vermifuge.The cause of worms is insufficient bile, and
behold, all the Osteopath had to do when he wished to serve notice on the
aforesaid worms to vacate the premises was to touch the button controlling
the stop-cock to the bile-duct, and they left.It was so simple and easy
we wondered how the world could have been so long finding it out.That was the proposition on which we were to
stand.If anything had to be removed, or brought back, or put in place,
all that was necessary was to open the floodgates, release the pent-up
forces of nature, and the thing was done!What a happy condition, to have _perfect_ faith!I remember a report came
to our school of an Osteopathic physician who read a paper before a
convention of his brethren, in which he recorded marvelous cures performed
in cases of tuberculosis.The paper was startling, even revolutionary, yet
it was not too much for our faith.We were almost indignant at some who
ventured to suggest that curing consumption by manipulation might be
claiming too much.These wonderful cures were performed in a town which I
afterward visited.I could find no one who knew of a single case that had
been cured.There were those who knew of cases of tuberculosis he had
treated, that had gone as most other bad cases of that disease go.It is one of the main cases, from
all that I can learn, upon which all the bold claims of Osteopathy as an
insanity cure are based.I remember an article under scare headlines big
enough for a bloody murder, flared out in the local paper.It was yet more
wonderfully heralded in the papers at the county seat.The metropolitan
dailies caught up the echo, which reverberated through Canada and was
finally heard across the seas!Osteopathic journals took it up and made
much of it.Those in school read it with eager satisfaction, and plunged
into their studies with fiercer enthusiasm.Many who had been "almost
persuaded" were induced by it to "cross the Rubicon," and take up the
study of this wonderful new science that could take a raving maniac,
condemned to a mad house by medical men, and with a few scientific twists
of the neck cause raging insanity to give place to gentle sleep that
should wake in sanity and health.Was it any wonder that students flocked to schools that professed to teach
how common plodding mortals could work such miracles?Was it strange that
anxious friends brought dear ones, over whom the black cloud of insanity
cast its shadows, hundreds of miles to be treated by this man?Or to the
Osteopathic colleges, from which, in all cases of which I ever knew, they
returned sadly disappointed?The report of that wonderful cure caused many intelligent laymen (and even
Dr.Pratt) to indulge a hope that insanity might be only a disturbance of
the blood supply to the brain caused by pressure from distorted "neck
bones," or other lesions, and that Osteopaths were to empty our
overcrowded madhouses.I
was told by an intimate friend of this great Osteopath that all these
startling reports we had supposed were published as news the papers were
glad to get because of their important truths, were but shrewd
advertising.I afterward talked with the man, and his friends who were at
the bedside when the miracle was performed, and while they believed that
there had been good done by the treatment, it was all so tame and
commonplace at home compared with its fame abroad that I have wondered
ever since if anything much was really done after all.Honesty--Plain Dealing--Education.I could multiply incidents, but it would grow
monotonous.I believe I have told enough that is disgusting to the
intelligent laity and medical men, and enough that is humiliating to the
capable, honest Osteopath, who practices his "new science" as standing for
all that is good in physio-therapy.I hope I have told, or recalled, something that will help physicians to
see that the way to clear up the turbidity existing in therapeutics to-day
is by open, honest dealing with the laity, and by a campaign of education
that shall impart to them enough of the scientific principles of medicine
so that they may know when they are being imposed upon by quacks and
grafters.I am encouraged to believe I am on the right track.After I had
written this booklet I read, in a report of the convention of the American
Medical Association held in Chicago, that one of the leaders of the
Association told his brethren that the most important work before them as
physicians was to conduct a campaign of education for the masses.It must
be done not only to protect the people, but as well to protect the honest
physician.There is another fact that faces the medical profession, and I believe I
have called attention to conditions that prove it.That is, that the hope
of the profession of "doctoring" being placed on an honest rational basis
lies in a broader and more thorough education of the physician.A broad,
liberal general education to begin with, then all that can be known about
medicine and surgery.Then all that there is in
physio-therapy, under whatsoever name, that promises to aid in curing or
preventing disease.If this humble production aids but a little in any of this great work,
then my object in writing will have been achieved."No; that was the Parallelogram," replied the colonel."A
Parallelopipedon is six times as bad as a Parallelogram.His color has a
verse about it, though, that says:

    'His hue is the most terrible
       That ever man has seen;
     'Tis pink and saffron, blue and red,
       Mixed up with apple green'.""And do you mean to say he's really got
away?""I do, indeed," returned the colonel."Got away, and Noah is glad of it,
because he doesn't have to feed him any more.But it'll never do to let
him stay loose; he will do too much damage.Why, Jimmieboy, suppose he
should overeat himself and die?He's the only one in the world, and we
can't afford to lose an animal like that; besides, after he has ruined
all the country around the turn, it's just as like as not he'll begin on
the rest of the picture, and eat it all up, frame and all.""That would be terrible, wouldn't it!You
are right--he must be captured.I have half a mind to go along with you
and help.""Half a mind isn't enough," retorted the colonel, shaking his head."You
can't go into the soldier business unless you have a whole mind--so
good-by, Jimmieboy.I must be running along; and should I not return, as
the poet says,

    'Pray do not weep for me, my boy,
       But, as the years slip by,
     Drop all your pennies in a bank--
       Brave soldiers never die;
     And some day I'll turn up again,
       Exalted, high in rank,
     And possibly I'll find some use
       For that small sum in bank.'""I'm not going to stay here while you are fighting," said Jimmieboy,
with a determined shake of his head."I've got a whole mind to go with
you, and a uniform to wear as well.But tell me, can I get up there on
the road?""I'll show you how, only put on your
uniform first.They won't let you go unless you are suitably dressed.Little boys, with striped trousers like yours, would be out of place,
but with a uniform such as yours is, with real gold on the cap and brass
buttons on the coat--well, I'm not sure but what they'll elect you
water-carrier, or general, or something equally important."So Jimmieboy hurried to his clothes-closet and quickly donned his
military suit, and grasping his sword firmly by the hilt, cried out:

"Ready!"Jimmieboy did as he was told."One--two--three--eyes open!"Again Jimmieboy did as he was ordered, although he couldn't see why he
should obey the colonel, who up to this afternoon had been entirely
subject to his orders.He opened his eyes at the command, and, much to
his surprise, found himself standing in the middle of that wooded road
in the picture, beneath the arching trees, the leaves of which rustled
softly as a sweet perfumed breeze blew through the branches.About him
on every side were groups of tin soldiers talking excitedly about the
escape of the devastating Parallelopipedon, every man of them armed to
the teeth and eager for the colonel's command to start off on the search
expedition.The band was playing merrily under the trees up the road
near the little brook, and back in the direction from which he had come,
through the heavy gilt frame, Jimmieboy could see the nursery just as he
had left it, while before him lay the turn at the end of the wood and
the unknown country now soon to be explored.JIMMIEBOY RECEIVES HIS ORDERS.For a few moments Jimmieboy was so overcome by the extreme novelty of
his position that he could do nothing but wander in and out among the
trees, wondering if he really was himself, and whether the soldiers by
whom he was surrounded were tin or creatures of flesh and blood.They
certainly looked and acted like human beings, and they talked in a
manner entirely different from what Jimmieboy was accustomed to expect
from the little pieces of painted tin he had so often played with on the
nursery floor, but he very soon learned that they were tin, and not made
up, like himself, of bone and sinew.The manner of his discovery was this: One of the soldiers, in a very
rash and fool-hardy fashion, tried to pick up a stone from the road to
throw at a poor little zinc robin that was whistling in the trees above
his head, and in bending over after the stone and then straightening
himself up to take aim, he snapped himself into two distinct pieces--as
indeed would any other tin soldier, however strong and well made, and of
course Jimmieboy was then able to see that the band with whom he had for
the moment cast his fortunes were nothing more nor less than bits of
brittle tin, to whom in some mysterious way had come life.The boy was
pained to note the destruction of the little man who had tried to throw
the stone at the robin, because he was always sorry for everybody upon
whom trouble had come, but he was not, on the whole, surprised at the
soldier's plight, for the simple reason that he had been taught that
boys who threw stones at the harmless little birds in the trees were
naughty and worthy of punishment, and he could not see why a tin soldier
should not be punished for doing what a small boy of right feelings
would disdain to do.After he had made up his mind that his companions were really of tin, he
became a bit fearful as to his own make-up, and the question that he now
asked himself was, "Am I tin, too, or what?"He was not long in
answering this question to his own satisfaction, for after bending his
little fingers to and fro a dozen or more times, he was relieved to
discover that he had not changed.The fingers did not snap off, as he
had feared they might, and he was glad.Barely had Jimmieboy satisfied himself on this point when a handsomely
dressed soldier, on a blue lead horse, came galloping up, and cried out
so loud that his voice echoed through the tall trees of the forest:

"Is General Jimmieboy here?""Jimmieboy is here," answered the little fellow."I'm Jimmieboy, but I
am no general.""But you have on a general's uniform," said the soldier.queried Jimmieboy, with a glance at his clothes."Well, if I
have, it's because they are the only soldier clothes I own.""Well, I am very sorry," said the soldier on horseback, "but if you wear
those clothes you've got to be general.It's a hard position to occupy,
and of course you'd rather be a high-private or a member of the band,
but as it is, there is no way out of it.If the clothes would fit any
one else here, you might exchange with him; but they won't, I can tell
that by looking at the yellow stripes on your trousers.The stripes
alone are wider than any of our legs."responded Jimmieboy, "I don't mind being general.I'd just as lief
be a general as not; I know how to wave a sword and march ahead of the
procession."At this there was a roar of laughter from the soldiers."Where did he ever get such notions as that?""I am afraid," said the soldier on horseback, with a kindly smile which
won Jimmieboy's heart, "that you do not understand what the duties of a
general are in this country.We aren't bound down by the notions of you
nursery people, who seem to think that all a general is good for is to
be stood up in front of a cannon loaded with beans, and knocked over
half a dozen times in the course of a battle.Have you ever read those
lines of High-private Tinsel in his little book, 'Poems in Pewter,' in
which he tells of the trials of a general of the tin soldiers?""Of course I haven't," said Jimmieboy."Just the man for a general, if he can't read," said one of the
soldiers."He'll never know what the newspapers say of him.""Well, I'll tell you the story," said the horseman, dismounting, and
standing on a stump by the road-side to give better effect to the poem,
which he recited as follows:

    "THE TIN SOLDIER GENERAL.I walked one day
         Along the way
     That leads from camp to city;
         And I espied
         At the road-side
     The hero of my ditty.His massive feet,
         In slippers neat,
     Were crossed in desperation;
         And from his eyes
         Salt tears did rise
     In awful exudation."asked Jimmieboy, who was not quite used to grown-up words
like exudation."Quarts," replied the soldier, with a frown.This poem
isn't good for much unless it goes right through without a stop--like an
express train."And then he resumed:

        "It filled my soul
         With horrid dole
     To see this wailing creature;
         How tears did sweep,
         And furrow deep,
     Along his nasal feature!My eyes grew dim
         To look at him,
     To see his tear-drops soiling
         His necktie bold,
         His trimmings gold,
     And all his rich clothes spoiling;

         And so I stopped,
         Beside him dropped,
     And quoth, 'Wilt tell me, mortal,
         Wherefore you sighed?'And he replied:
     'Wilt I?"I don't know what chortle means," said Jimmieboy."But I guess the man who wrote the
poem did, so it's all right, and we may safely go on to the next verse,
which isn't very different in its verbiology--"

"Its wha-a-at?""Gentlemen," said the declaiming soldier, severely, "there are some
words in our language which no creature should be asked to utter more
than once in a life-time, and that is one of them.I shall not endanger
my oratorical welfare by speaking it again.Suffice it for me to say
that if you want to use that word yourselves, you will find it in the
dictionary somewhere under F, or Z, or Ph, or some other letter which I
cannot at this moment recall.But the poem goes on to say:

        "Then as we sat
         The road-side at--
     His tears a moment quelling--
         In accents pale
         He told the tale
     Which I am also telling."said a little green corporal at Jimmieboy's side."Hasn't he
begun the story yet?""Yes, stupid," said a high-private."Of course he has; but it's one of
those stories that take a long time to begin, and never finish until the
very end.""Oh yes, I know," said another."It's a story like one I heard of the
other day.You can lay it down whenever you want to, and be glad to have
the chance.""That's it," said the high-private."I wish you fellows would keep still," said the soldier who was
reciting."I ought to have been a quarter of the way through the first
half of that poem by this time, and instead of that I'm only a sixteenth
of the way through the first eighth.""You can't expect to go more than eight miles an hour," said the
corporal, "even in poetry like that.asked Jimmieboy, who was quite interested to hear
the rest of the poem."I'll have to tell you some other time, general," replied the soldier."These tin warriors here haven't any manners.Some day, when you have
time to spare, I'll tell you the rest of it, because I know you'll be
glad to hear it.""Yes, general," put in the corporal, with a laugh."Some day when you
have a year to spare get him to tell you the first twenty-seventh of the
next ninety-sixth of it.It won't take him more than eleven months and
thirty-two days to do it."said the poetic soldier, mounting his horse and riding off with
an angry flush on his cheek."Some day, when I get promoted to the
ranks, I'll get even with you."asked Jimmieboy, as the soldier rode off."He's Major Blueface, and he has to look after the luggage," replied the
corporal."And as for that poem of his, Jimmieboy, I want to warn you.He has a printed copy of it that takes seven trunks to carry.He says it
was written by High-private Tinsel, but that's all nonsense."Then I like it all the better," said Jimmieboy."I always like what
people I like write.""There's no accounting for tastes," returned the corporal."We don't any
of us like the major.Looking after
luggage is such awfully hard work, we didn't want to make any one else
do it, and so we elected him.""He seems to me to be a very
nice soldier.""That's just it," returned the corporal."He's just the kind of soldier
to please little boys like you, and he'd look perfectly splendid in a
white and gold parlor like your mamma's, but in camp he's a terror.Keeps his boots shined up like a looking-glass; wears his Sunday uniform
all the time; in fact, he has seven Sunday uniforms--one for each day of
the week; and altogether he makes the rest of us feel so mean and cheap
that we can't like him.He offered a prize once to the soldier who'd
like him the best, and who do you think won it?""I don't know," said Jimmieboy."He won it himself," retorted the corporal.But
you'd better go over to the colonel's quarters right away, Jimmieboy."He hasn't sent for me, has he?"That's what the major came to tell you," answered the
corporal."But he didn't say so," returned Jimmieboy."No, he never does what he is sent to do," explained the corporal.If he had told you the colonel wanted you, we'd all
know the colonel didn't want you.He's so
anxious to read his poem to somebody that he always forgets his orders,
and when he does half remember what he is sent to do, we can tell what
the orders are by what he doesn't say.""I shouldn't think he'd be a good man to look after the luggage if he
forgets everything that way," said Jimmieboy."That's just where he's great," returned the corporal."For, don't you
see, every man in the regiment wants to carry about three times as much
luggage as he ought to, and the major makes it all right by forgetting
two-thirds of it.Oh, there's no denying that he's one of the greatest
luggage men there ever was; but you run along now, or the colonel may
lose his temper, and that always delays things.""I'm not afraid of the colonel," said Jimmieboy, bravely."Neither are we," said the corporal, in reply to this, "but we don't
like to have our campaign delayed, and when the colonel loses his temper
we have to wait and wait until he finds it again.So Jimmieboy, wondering more and more at the singular habits of the tin
soldiers, ran off in search of the colonel, whom he found sitting by the
brook-side fishing, and surrounded by his staff.said Jimmieboy, as he caught sight of the colonel."Been here only five minutes, and I've caught
three hickory twigs, a piece of wire, and one of the finest colds in my
head I ever had.""Good," said Jimmieboy, with a laugh."Plenty of 'em," answered the colonel."But they're all so small I'd
have to throw 'em back if I caught 'em.They know that well enough, and
so save me trouble by not biting.But I say, I suppose you know we can't
start this expedition without ammunition?"queried Jimmieboy, to whom the word ammunition was
entirely new.Why, that's stuff to load our guns with," returned the
colonel."You must be a great general not to know that.""You must excuse me," said Jimmieboy, with a blush."There is a great
deal that I don't know.I'm only five years old, and papa hasn't had
time to tell me everything yet.""Well, it's all right, anyhow," replied the colonel."You'll learn a
great deal in the next hundred years, so we won't criticise; but of
course, you know, we can't go off without ammunition any more than a gun
can.Now, as general of the forces, it is your duty to look about you
and lay in the necessary supplies.For the guns we shall need about
fourteen thousand rounds of preserved cherries, seventeen thousand
rounds of pickled peaches for the cannon, and a hundred and sixty-two
dozen cans of strawberry jam for me."Jimmieboy's eyes grew so round and large as he listened to these words
that the major turned pale."Then," continued the colonel, "we have to have powder and shell, of
course.Perhaps four hundred and sixteen pounds of powdered sugar and
ninety-seven barrels of shells with almonds in 'em would do for our
purposes.""But--but what are we to do with all these things, and where am I to
get them?"gasped Jimmieboy, beginning to be very sorry that he had
accepted so important a position as that of general.Why, capture
the Parallelopipedon, of course.What did you suppose we'd do with
'em--throw them at canary-birds?""You don't load guns with preserved cherries, do you?"Well, I just guess we do," returned the colonel."And we
load the cannon with pickled peaches, and to keep me from deserting and
going over to the enemy, they keep me loaded to the muzzle with
strawberry jam from the time I start until we get back.""You can't kill a Parawelopipedon with cherries and peaches, can you?""Not quite, but nearly," said the colonel."We never hit him with enough
of them to kill him, but just try to coax him with 'em, don't you see?We don't do as you do in your country.We don't shoot the enemy with
lead bullets, and try to kill him and make him unhappy.We try to coax
him back by shooting sweetmeats at him, and if he won't be coaxed, we
bombard him with pickled peaches until they make him sick, and then he
has to surrender.""It must be pretty fine to be an enemy," said Jimmieboy, smacking his
lips as he thought of being bombarded with sweetmeats."It is," exclaimed the colonel, with enthusiasm."It's so nice, that
they have to do the right thing by me in the matter of jam to keep me
from being an enemy myself."returned Jimmieboy, who couldn't see why it would
not be pleasant for him to be an enemy, and get all these delightful
things.Why, you get the almonds and the powdered sugar and all the
mince-pie you can eat--what more do you want?""Nothing," gasped Jimmieboy, overcome by the prospect."I wouldn't mind
being a general for a million years at that rate."With which noble sentiment the little fellow touched his cap to the
colonel, and set off, accompanied by a dozen soldiers, to find the
cherries, the peaches, the almonds, and the powdered sugar.MAJOR BLUEFACE TRIES TO ASSIST.The expedition under Jimmieboy's command had hardly been under way a
quarter of an hour when the youthful general realized that the colonel
had not told him where the cherries and peaches and other necessary
supplies were to be found."Dear me," he said, stopping short in the road."I don't know anything
about this country, and I am sure I sha'n't be able to find all those
good things--except in my mamma's pantry, and it would never do for me
to take 'em from there.I might have to fight cook to get 'em, and that
would be dreadful.""Yes, it would," said Major Blueface, riding up as Jimmieboy spoke these
words."It would be terribly awful, for if you should fight with her
now, she wouldn't make you a single pancake or pie or custard or
anything after you got back.""I'm glad you've come," said Jimmieboy, with a sigh of relief."Perhaps
you can tell me what I've got to do to get that ammu--that ammu--oh,
that ammuknow, don't you?""Yes, that's it," said Jimmieboy."Could you tell me where to get it?""I could; but, really," returned the major, "I'm very much afraid I'd
better not, unless you'll promise not to pay any attention to what I
say.""I don't see what good that would do," said Jimmieboy, a little
surprised at the major's words."What's the use of your saying anything,
if I am not to pay any attention to you?""I'll tell you if you'll sit down a moment," was the major's reply, upon
which he and Jimmieboy sat down on a log at the road-side.The major then recited his story as follows:

    "THE MAJOR'S MISFORTUNE.When I was born, some years ago,
       The world was standing upside down;
     Pekin was off in Mexico,
       And Paris stood near Germantown.And shone most brilliantly by day;
     The while the sun did not appear
       Until the moon had gone away.Which was, you see, a very strange,
       Unhappy way of doing things,
     And people did not like the change,
       Save clods who took the rank of kings.For kings as well were going wrong,
       And'stead of crowns wore beaver hats,
     While those once mean and poor grew strong;
       The dogs e'en ran from mice and rats.The Frenchman spoke the Spanish tongue,
       The Russian's words were Turkestan;
     And England's nerves were all unstrung
       By cockneys speaking Aryan.Schools went to boys, and billie-goats
       Drove children harnessed up to carts.The rivers flowed up hill, and oats
       Were fed to babies'stead of tarts.The stars were topsy-turvy all,
     And hence it is my fate forlorn
       When things are short to call them tall;

     When thing are black to call them white;
       And if they're good to call them bad;
     To say 'tis day when it is night;
       To call an elephant a shad.And when I say that this is this,
       That it is that you'll surely know;
     For truth's a thing I always miss,
       And what I say is never so."And then Jimmieboy knew that it was true, and he felt very sorry for the
major."Never mind, major," he said, tapping his companion affectionately on
the shoulder."I'll believe what you say if nobody else does.""I
wouldn't have you do that for all the world.If you did, it would get us
into all sorts of trouble.If I had thought you'd do that, I'd never
have told you the story.""Very well," said Jimmieboy, "then I won't.Only I should think you'd
want to have somebody believe in you.""Oh, you can believe in me all you want," returned the major."I'm one
of the finest fellows in the world, and worthy of anybody's
friendship--and if anybody ought to know, Jimmieboy, I'm the one, for I
know myself intimately.I've known myself ever since I was a little bit
of a boy, and I can tell you if there's any man in the world who has a
noble character and a good conscience and a heart in the right place,
I'm him.It's only what I say you mustn't believe in.Remember that, and
we shall be all right."Now tell me what you
don't know about finding preserved cherries and pickled peaches.We've
got to lay in a very large supply of them, and I haven't the first idea
how to get 'em."What I don't know about 'em would take a long time to tell,"
returned the major, with a shake of his head, "because there's so much
of it.In the first place,

        "I do not know
         If cherries grow
     On trees, or roofs, or rocks;
         Or if they come
         In cans--ho-hum!--
     Or packed up in a box.Mayhap you'll find
         The proper kind
     Down where they sell red paint;
         And then, you see,
         Oh, dear!"That appears to settle the cherries," said Jimmieboy, somewhat
impatiently, for it did seem to him that the major was wasting a great
deal of valuable time."I could go on like that
forever about cherries.For instance:

        "You might perchance
         Get some in France,
     And some in Germany;
         A crate or two
         In far Barboo,
     And some in Labradee.""It's Labrador," said the major, with a smile; "but Labradee rhymes
better with Germany, and as long as you know I'm not telling the truth,
and are not likely to go there, it doesn't make any difference if I
change it a little.""That's so," said Jimmieboy, with a snicker.Do you know anything that isn't so about them?""Oh, yes, lots," said the major."I know that when the peach is green,
       And growing on the tree,
     It's harder than a common bean,
       And yellow as can be.I know that if you eat a peach
       That's just a bit too young,
     A lesson strong the act will teach,
       And leave your nerves unstrung.And, furthermore, I know this fact:
       The crop, however hale
     In every year before 'tis packed,
       Doth never fail to fail.""That's very interesting," said Jimmieboy, when the major had recited
these lines, "but it doesn't help me a bit.What I want to know is how
the pickled peaches are to be found, and where.""Oh, that's it, is it?""Well, it's easy enough to tell
you that.First as to how you are to find them--this applies to
huckleberries and daisies and fire-engines and everything else, just as
well as it does to peaches, so you'd better listen.It's a very valuable
thing to know."The way to find a pickled peach,
       A cow, or piece of pumpkin pie,
     A simple lesson is to teach,
       As can be seen with half an eye.Look up the road and down the road,
       Look North and South and East and West.Let not a single episode
       Come in betwixt you and your quest.Search morning, night, and afternoon,
       From Monday until Saturday;
     By light of sun and that of moon,
       Nor mind the troubles in your way.And keep this up until you get
       The thing that you are looking for,
     And then, of course, you need not fret
       About the matter any more.""You are a great help," said Jimmieboy."Don't mention it, my dear boy," replied the major, so pleased that he
smiled and cracked some of the red enamel on his lips.In fact, to people who
lisp and pronounce their esses as though they were teeaitches, it's
quite the same.It was very easy to tell you how to find a pickled
peach, but it's much harder to tell you where.In fact, I don't know
that I can tell you where, but if I were not compelled to ignore the
truth I should inform you at once that I haven't the slightest idea.But, of course, I can tell you where you might find them if they were
there--which, of course, they aren't.For instance:

    "Pickled peaches might be found
     In the gold mines underground;

     Pickled peaches might be seen
     Rolling down the Bowling Green;

     Pickled peaches might spring up
     In a bed of custard cup;

     Pickled peaches might sprout forth
     From an ice-cake in the North;

     I have seen them in the South
     In a pickaninny's mouth;

     I have seen them in the West
     Hid inside a cowboy's vest;

     I have seen them in the East
     At a small boy's birthday feast;

     Maybe, too, a few you'd see
     In the land of the Chinee;

     And this statement broad I'll dare:
     You might find them anywhere.""I feel easier now that I know all this.I
don't know what I should have done if I hadn't met you, major.""It's very unkind of you to say so," said the major, very much pleased
by Jimmieboy's appreciation."Yes," answered Jimmieboy, "I do.I
think pickled peaches come in cans and bottles.""Bottles and cans,
         Bottles and cans,
     When a man marries it ruins his plans,"

quoted the major."I got married once," he added, "but I became a
bachelor again right off.My wife wrote better poetry than I could, and
I couldn't stand that, you know.That's how I came to be a soldier.""That hasn't anything to do with the pickled peaches," said Jimmieboy,
impatiently."Now, unless I am very much mistaken, we can go to the
grocery store and buy a few bottles.""What's the use of buying bottles when you're
after pickled peaches?'Of all the futile, futile things--
       Remarked the Apogee--
     That is as truly futilest
       As futilest can be.'You never heard my poem on the Apogee, did you, Jimmieboy?"I never even heard of an Apogee.What is an Apogee, anyhow?""To give definitions isn't a part of my bargain," answered the major."I
haven't the slightest idea what an Apogee is.He may be a bird with a
whole file of unpaid bills, for all I know, but I wrote a poem about him
once that made another poet so jealous that he purposely caught a bad
cold and sneezed his head off; and I don't blame him either, because it
was a magnificent thing in its way.Listen:

    "THE APOGEE.The Apogee wept saline tears
       Into the saline sea,
     To overhear two mutineers
       Discuss their pedigree.Said he:
     Of all the futile, futile things
       That ever I did see.That is as truly futilest
       As futilest can be.He hied him thence to his hotel,
       And there it made him ill
     To hear a pretty damosel
       A bass song try to trill.Said he:
     Of all the futile, futile things--
       To say it I am free--
     That is about the futilest
       That ever I did see.He went from sea to mountain height,
       And there he heard a lad
     Of sixty-eight compare the sight
       To other views he'd had;
                       And he
     Remarked: Of all the futile things
       That ever came to me,
     This is as futily futile
       As futile well can be.Then in disgust he went back home,
       His door-bell rang all day,
     But no one to the door did come:
       The butler'd gone away.Said he:
     This is the strangest, queerest world
       That ever I did see.of earth, and nine-
       Ty-eight futility.""It sounds well," said Jimmieboy."Why,
it's--it's a word, you know, and sort of stands for 'what's the use.'"To be futile means that you are wasting
time, eh?""I'm glad you said it and not I, because
that makes it true.If I'd said it, it wouldn't have been so.""Well, all I've got to say," said Jimmieboy, "is that if anybody ever
came to me and asked me where he could find a futile person, I'd send
him over to you.Here we've wasted nearly the whole afternoon and we
haven't got a single thing.We haven't even talked of anything but
peaches and cherries, and we've got to get jam and sugar and almonds
yet.""It isn't any laughing matter," said Jimmieboy."It's a very serious
piece of business, in fact.Here's this Parawelopipedon going around
ruining everything he can lay his claws on, and instead of helping me
out of the fix I'm in, and starting the expedition off, you sit here and
tell me about Apogees and other things I haven't time to hear about.""I was only smiling to show how sorry I was," said the major,
apologetically."I always smile when I am sad,
       And when I'm filled with glee
     A solitary tear-drop trick-
       Les down the cheek of me.""Oh, that's it," said Jimmieboy."Well, let's stop fooling now and get
those supplies.""Where are the soldiers who accompanied
you?We'll give 'em their orders, and you'll have the supplies in no
time.""Why, don't you see," said the major, "that's the nice thing about being
a general.If you have to do something you don't know how to do, you
command your men to go and do it.That lifts the responsibility from
your shoulders to theirs.They don't dare disobey, and there you are."cried Jimmieboy, delighted to find so easy a way out of
his troubles."I'll give them their orders at once.I'll tell them to
get the supplies."They'll have to, or be put in the guard-house," returned the major."And they don't like that, you know, because the guard-house hasn't any
walls, and it's awfully draughty.But, as I said before, where are the
soldiers?"said Jimmieboy, starting up and looking anxiously about him."They seem to have," said the major, putting his hand over his eyes and
gazing up and down the road, upon which no sign of Jimmieboy's command
was visible."You ordered them to halt when you sat down here, didn't
you?""No," said Jimmieboy, "I didn't.""Then that accounts for it," returned the major, with a scornful glance
at Jimmieboy.They couldn't halt without orders, and
they must be eight miles from here by this time.""Why, they'll march on forever
unless you get word to them to halt.asked Jimmieboy, growing tearful."There are only two things you can do.The earth is round, and in a few
years they'll pass this way again, and then you can tell them to stop.The second is to despatch me on horseback
to overtake and tell them to keep right on.They'll know what you mean,
and they'll halt and wait until you come up.""That's the best plan," cried Jimmieboy, with a sigh of relief."You
hurry ahead and make them wait for me, and I'll come along as fast as I
can."So the major mounted his horse and galloped away, leaving Jimmieboy
alone in the road, trudging manfully ahead as fast as his small legs
could carry him.[Illustration: THE PARALLELOPIPEDON AND THE MIRROR.JIMMIEBOY MEETS THE ENEMY.As the noise made by the clattering hoofs of Major Blueface's horse grew
fainter and fainter, and finally died away entirely in the distance,
Jimmieboy was a little startled to hear something that sounded very like
a hiss in the trees behind him.At first he thought it was the light
breeze blowing through the branches, making the leaves rustle, but when
it was repeated he stopped short in the road and glanced backward,
grasping his sword as he did so."Who are you, and what do you want?""Don't talk so loud,
general, the major may come back."I
don't know whether or not I'm big enough not to be afraid of you.Can't
you come out of the bushes and let me see you?""Not unless the major is out of sight," was the answer."I can't stand
the major; but you needn't be afraid of me.I wouldn't hurt you for all
the world.cried Jimmieboy, aghast."I'm the enemy," replied the invisible object."That's what I call
myself when I'm with sensible people.Other people have a long name for
me that I never could pronounce or spell.That's the name I can't pronounce," said the invisible
animal."I'm the Parallelandsoforth, and I've been trying to have an
interview with you ever since I heard they'd made you general.The fact
is, Jimmieboy, I am very anxious that you should succeed in capturing
me, because I don't like it out here very much.The fences are the
toughest eating I ever had, and I actually sprained my wisdom-tooth at
breakfast this morning trying to bite a brown stone ball off the top of
a gate post.""But if you feel that way," said Jimmieboy, somewhat surprised at this
unusual occurrence, "why don't you surrender?""A Parallelandsoforth of my standing
surrender right on the eve of a battle that means all the sweetmeats I
can eat, and more too?"I wish I could see you," said Jimmieboy, earnestly."I don't like
standing here talking to a wee little voice with nothing to him.Why
don't you come out here where I can see you?""It's for your good, Jimmieboy; that's why I stay in here.Why, it puts me all in a tremble just to look at myself; and
if it affects me that way, just think how it would be with you.""I wouldn't be afraid," said Jimmieboy, bravely."Yes, you would too," answered the Parallelopipedon."You'd be so scared
you couldn't run, I am so ugly.Didn't the major tell you that story
about my reflection in the looking-glass?"The story is in rhyme, and the major always tells
everybody all the poetry he knows," said the invisible enemy."That's
why I never go near him.He has only enough to last one year, and the
second year he tells it all over again.I'm surprised he never told you
about my reflection in the mirror, because it is one of his worst, and
he always likes them better than the others.""I'll ask him to tell it to me next time I see him," said Jimmieboy,
"unless you'll tell it to me now.""I'd just as lief tell you," said the Parallelopipedon."Only you
mustn't laugh or cry, because you haven't time to laugh, and generals
never cry.This is the way it goes:

    "THE PARALLELOPIPEDON AND THE MIRROR.The Parallelopipedon so very ugly is,
     His own heart fills with terror when he looks upon his phiz.That's why he wears blue goggles--twenty pairs upon his nose,
     And never dares to show himself, no matter where he goes.One day when he was walking down a crowded village street,
     He looked into a little shop where stood a mirror neat.He saw his own reflection there as plain as plain could be;
     And said, 'I'd give four dollars if that really wasn't me.'And, strange to say, the figure in the mirror's silver face
     Was also filled with terror at the other's lack of grace;
     And this reflection trembled till it strangely came to pass
    The handsome mirror shivered to ten thousand bits of glass.To this tale there's a moral, and that moral briefly is:
     If you perchance are burdened with a terrifying phiz,
     Don't look into your mirror--'tis a fearful risk to take--
     'Tis certain sure to happen that the mirror it will break.""Well, if that's so, I guess I don't want to see you," said Jimmieboy.But tell me; if all this is true, how did
the major come to say it?For instance," explained
the Parallelopipedon, "as a rule I can't pronounce my name, but in
reciting that poem to you I did speak my name in the very first
line--but if you only knew how it hurt me to do it!Oh dear me, how it
hurt!"Once," said Jimmieboy, wincing at the remembrance of his painful
experience."Well, pronouncing my name is to me worse than having all my teeth
pulled and then put back again, and except when I get hold of a fine
general like you I never make the sacrifice," said the Parallelopipedon."But tell me, Jimmieboy, you are out after preserved cherries and
pickled peaches, I understand?""And powdered sugar, almonds, jam, and several
other things that are large and elegant.""Well, just let me tell you one thing," said the Parallelopipedon,
confidentially."I'm so sick of cherries and peaches that I run every
time I see them, and when I run there is no tin soldier or general of
your size in the world that can catch me.I am
here to be captured; you are here to capture me.To accomplish our
various purposes we've got to begin right, and you might as well
understand now as at any other time that you are beginning wrong.""I don't know what else to do," said Jimmieboy.The
colonel told me to get those things, and I supposed I ought to get 'em.""It doesn't pay to suppose," said the Parallelopipedon."Many a victory
has been lost by a supposition.As that old idiot Major Blueface said
once, when he tried to tell an untruth, and so hit the truth by mistake:

    'Success always comes to
       The mortal who knows,
     And never to him who
       Does naught but suppose.For knowledge is certain,
       While hypothesees
     Oft drop defeat's curtain
       On great victories.'""They are ifs in words of four syllables," said the Parallelopipedon,
"and you want to steer clear of them as much as you can.""I'll try to," said Jimmieboy."But how am I to get knowledge instead of
hypotheseeses?"Well, that's only natural," said the Parallelopipedon, kindly."There
are only two creatures about here that do know everything.They--between
you and me--are me and myself.The others you meet here don't even begin
to know everything, though they'll try to make you believe they do.Now
I dare say that tin colonel of yours would try to make you believe that
water is wet, and that fire is hot, and other things like that.Well,
they are, but he doesn't know it.He has put his hand
into a pail of water and found out that it was wet, but he doesn't know
why it is wet any more than he knows why fire is hot.""Certainly," returned the Parallelopipedon."Water is wet because it is
water, and fire is hot because it wouldn't be fire if it wasn't hot.Oh,
it takes brains to know everything, Jimmieboy, and if there's one thing
old Colonel Zinc hasn't got, it's brains.If you don't believe it, cut
his head off some day and see for yourself.You won't find a whole brain
in his head.""It must be nice to know everything," said Jimmieboy."It's pretty nice," said the Parallelopipedon, cautiously."But it's not
always the nicest thing in the world.If you are off on a long journey,
for instance, it's awfully hard work to carry all you know along with
you.It has given me a headache many a time, I can tell you.Sometimes I
wish I did like your papa, and kept all I know in books instead of in my
head.It's a great deal better to do things that way; then, when you go
travelling, and have to take what you know along with you, you can just
pack it up in a trunk and make the railroad people carry it.""Do you know what's going to happen to-morrow and the next day?"asked
Jimmieboy, gazing in rapt admiration at the spot whence the voice
proceeded.That's just where the great trouble comes in," answered
the Parallelopipedon."It isn't so much bother to know what has
been--what everybody knows--but when you have to store up in your mind
thousands and millions of things that aren't so now, but have got to be
so some day, it's positively awful.Why, Jimmieboy," he said,
impressively, "you'd be terrified if I told you what is going to be
known by the time you go to school; it's awful to think of all the
things you will have to learn then that aren't things yet, but are going
to be within a year or two.I'm real sorry for the little boys who will
live a hundred years from now, when I think of all the history they will
have to learn when they go to school--history that isn't made yet.Just
take the Presidents of the United States, for instance.In George
Washington's time it didn't take a boy five seconds to learn the list of
Presidents; but think of that list to-day!Why, there are twenty-five
names on it now, and more to come.Now I--I
know the names of all the Presidents there's ever going to be, and it
would take me just eighteen million nine hundred and sixty-seven years,
eleven months and twenty-six days, four hours and twenty-eight minutes
to tell you all of them, and even then I wouldn't be half through.""Why, it's terrible," said Jimmieboy."Yes, indeed it is," returned the Parallelopipedon."You ought to be
glad you are a little boy now instead of having to wait until then.The
boys of the year 19,605,726,422 are going to have the hardest time in
the world learning things, and I don't believe they'll get through
going to school much before they're ninety years old.""I guess the colonel is glad he doesn't know all that," said Jimmieboy,
"if it's so hard to carry it around with you.""Indeed he ought to be, if he isn't," ejaculated the Parallelopipedon."There's no two ways about it; if he had the weight of one half of what
I know on his shoulders, it would bend him in two and squash him into a
piece of tin-foil.""Say," said Jimmieboy, after a moment's pause."I heard my papa say he
thought I might be President of the United States some day.If you know
all the names of the Presidents that are to come, tell me, will I be?""I don't remember any name like Jimmieboy on the list," said the
Parallelopipedon; "but that doesn't prove anything.You might get
elected on your last name.But don't let's talk about that--that's
politics, and I don't like politics.What I want to know is, do you
really want to capture me?""Yes, I do," said Jimmieboy."Then you'd better give up trying to get the peaches and cherries," said
the Parallelopipedon, firmly.You can shoot 'em at me
at the rate of a can a minute for ninety-seven years, and I'll never
surrender."But what am I to do, then?""What must I do
to capture you?""Get something in the place of the cherries and peaches that I like,
that's all."But I don't know what you like," said Jimmieboy."No--and you never will," answered the Parallelopipedon.I never eat lunch, breakfast, tea, or supper.I never eat
anything but dinner, and I eat that four times a day."Jimmieboy laughed, half with mirth at the oddity of the
Parallelopipedon's habit of eating, and half with the pleasure it gave
him to think of what a delectable habit it was.Four dinners a day
seemed to him to be the height of bliss, and he almost wished he too
were a Parallelopipedon, that he might enjoy the same privilege."Never," said the Parallelopipedon.There isn't time for it in
the first place, and in the second there's never anything left between
meals for me to eat.But if you had ever dined with me you'd know
mighty well what I like, for I always have the same thing at every
single dinner--two platefuls of each thing.It's a fine plan, that of
having the same dishes at every dinner, day after day.Your stomach
always knows what to expect, and is ready for it, so you don't get
cholera morbus.If you want me to, I'll tell you what I always have, and
what you must get me before you can coax me back."And then the Parallelopipedon recited the following delicious bill of
fare for the young general."THE PARALLELOPIPEDON'S DINNER.First bring on a spring mock-turtle
       Stuffed with chestnuts roasted through,
     Served in gravy; then a fertile
       Steaming bowl of oyster stew.Then about six dozen tartlets
       Full of huckleberry jam,
     Edges trimmed with juicy Bartletts--
       Pears, these latter--then some ham.Follow these with cauliflower,
       Soaked in maple syrup sweet;
     Then an apple large and sour,
       And a rich red rosy beet.Then eight quarts of cream--vanilla
       Is the flavor I like best--
     Acts sublimely as a chiller,
       Gives your fevered system rest.After this a pint of coffee,
       Forty jars of marmalade,
     And a pound of peanut toffee,
       Then a pumpkin pie--home-made.Top this off with pickled salmon,
       Cold roast beef, and eat it four
     Times each day, and ghastly famine
       Ne'er will enter at your door."cried Jimmieboy, dancing up and down, and clapping his
hands with delight at the very thought of such a meal."Do you mean to
say that you eat that four times a day?""Yes," said the Parallelopipedon, "I do.In fact, general, it is that
that has made me what I am.I was originally a Parallelogram, and I ate
that four times a day, and it kept doubling me up until I became six
Parallelograms as I am to-day.Get me those things--enough of them to
enable me to have 'em five times a day, and I surrender.Without them, I
go on and stay escaped forever, and the longer I stay escaped, the worse
it will be for these people who live about here, for I shall devastate
the country.I shall chew up all the mowing-machines in Pictureland.I'll bite the smoke-stack off every railway engine I encounter, and
throw it into the smoking car, where it really belongs.I'll drink all
the water in the wells.I'll pull up all the cellars by the roots; I may
even go so far as to run down into your nursery, and gnaw into the wire
that holds this picture country upon the wall, and let it drop into the
water pitcher.But, oh dear, there's the major coming down the road!"he
added, in a tone of alarm."I must go, or he'll insist on telling me a
poem.But remember what I say, my boy, and beware!I'll do all I
threaten to do if you don't do what I tell you.There was a slight rustling among the leaves, and the Parallelopipedon's
voice died away as Major Blueface came galloping up astride of his
panting, lather-covered steed.CHAPTER V.

THE MAJOR RETURNS."Well," said Jimmieboy, as the major dismounted, "did you catch up with
them?""No, I didn't," returned the major, evidently much excited."I should
have caught them but for a dreadful encounter I had up the road, for
between you and me, Jimmieboy, I have had a terrible adventure since I
saw you last, and the soldiers I went to order back have been destroyed
to the very last man.""I am glad I didn't go with you."I was attacked about four miles up the road by a tremendous sixty-pound
Quandary, and I was nearly killed," said the major."The soldiers had
only got four and a half miles on their way, and hearing the disturbance
and my cries for help they hastened to the rescue, and were simply
an-ni-hi-lated, which is old English for all mashed to pieces.""Oh, I had a way, and it worked, that's all.I'm the safest soldier in
the world, I am.You can capture me eight times a day, but I am always
sure to escape," said the major, proudly."But, my dear general, how is
it that you do not tremble?Are you not aware that under the
circumstances you ought to be a badly frightened warrior?""I don't tremble, because I don't know whether you are telling the truth
or not," said Jimmieboy."Besides, I never saw a Quandary, and so I
can't tell how terrible he is."He's more than dreadful," returned the major."No word of two syllables
expresses his dreadfulness.He is simply calamitous; and if there was a
longer word in the dictionary applying to his case I'd use it, if it
took all my front teeth out to say it.""That's all very well," said Jimmieboy, "but you can't make me shiver
with fear by saying he's calamitous.Well, I guess not," answered the major, scornfully.Would you bite an apple if you could swallow it whole?""I think I would," said Jimmieboy."How would I get the juice of it if I
didn't?""You'd get just as much juice whether you bit it or not," snapped the
major, who did not at all like Jimmieboy's coolness under the
circumstances."The Quandary doesn't bite anything, because his mouth is
so large there isn't anything he can bite.He just takes you as you
stand, gives a great gulp, and there you are."queried Jimmieboy, who could not quite follow the major."Wherever you happen to be, of course," said the major, gruffly."You
aren't a very sharp general, it seems to me.You don't seem to be able
to see through a hole with a millstone in it.I have to explain
everything to you just as if you were a baby or a school-teacher, but I
can just tell you that if you ever were attacked by a Quandary you
wouldn't like it much, and if he ever swallowed you you'd be a mighty
lonesome general for a little while."Don't get mad at me, major," said Jimmieboy, clapping his companion on
the back."I'll be frightened if you want me to.Br-rr-rrr-rrr-rrrrr!There, is that the kind of a tremble you want me to have?""Thank you, yes," the major replied, his face clearing and his smile
returning."I am very much obliged; and now to show you that you haven't
made any mistake in getting frightened, I'll tell you what a Quandary
is, and what he has done, and how I managed to escape; and as poetry is
the easiest method for me to express my thoughts with, I'll put it all
in rhyme.He is a fearful animal,
       That quaint old Quandary--
     A cousin of the tragical
     And whimsically magical
       Dilemma-bird is he.He has an eye that's wonderful--
       'Tis like a public school:
     It has a thousand dutiful,
     Though scarcely any beautiful,
       Small pupils 'neath its rule.And every pupil--marvelous
       Indeed, sir, to relate--
     When man becomes contiguous,
     Makes certainty ambiguous--
       Which is unfortunate.For when this ambiguity
       Has seized upon his prize,
     Whate'er man tries, to do it he
     Will find when he is through it, he
       Had best done otherwise.And hence it is this animal,
       Of which I sing my song,
     This creature reprehensible,
     Is held by persons sensible
       Responsible for wrong.So if a friend or foe you see
       Departing from his aim,
     Be full, I pray, of charity--
     He may have met the Quandary,
       And so is not to blame.""That is very pretty," said Jimmieboy, as the major finished; "but, do
you know, major, I don't understand one word of it."Much to Jimmieboy's surprise the major was pleased at this remark."Thank you, Jimmieboy," he said."That proves that I am a true poet.I
think there's some meaning in those lines, but it's so long since I
wrote them that I have forgotten exactly what I did mean, and it's that
very thing that makes a poem out of the verses.Poetry is nothing but
riddles in rhyme.You have to guess what is meant by the lines, and the
harder that is, the greater the poem.""But I don't see much use of it," said Jimmieboy."Riddles are fun
sometimes, but poetry isn't.""That's very true," said the major.If it
wasn't for poetry, the poets couldn't make a living, or if they did,
they'd have to go into some other business, and most other businesses
are crowded as it is.""Do people ever make a living writing poetry?"He called himself the
Grocer-Poet, because he was a grocer in the day-time and a poet at
night.He sold every poem he wrote, too," said the major.When he'd wake up
in the morning as a grocer he'd read what he had written the night
before as a poet, and then he'd buy the verses from himself and throw
them into the fire.He stares you right in the face whenever he meets you, and no
matter what you want to do he tries to force you to do the other thing.The only way to escape him is not to do anything, but go back where you
started from, and begin all over again."Why, where he's always met, of course, at a fork in the road.That's where he gets in his fine work," said the major."Suppose, for
instance, you were out for a stroll, and you thought you'd like to
go--well, say to Calcutta.You stroll along, and you stroll along, and
you stroll along.Then you come to a place where the road splits, one
half going to the right and one to the left, or, if you don't like right
and left, we'll say one going to Calcutta by way of Cape Horn, and the
other going to Calcutta by way of Greenland's icy mountains.""It's a long walk either way," said Jimmieboy.It's a walk that isn't often taken," assented the major, with a
knowing shake of the head."But at the fork of this road the Quandary
attacks you.He stops you and says, 'Which way are you going to
Calcutta?'and you say, 'Well, as it is a warm day, I think I'll go by
way of Greenland's icy mountains.''No,' says the Quandary, 'you won't
do any such thing, because it may snow.'Very well,' say you, 'I'll go the other way, then.''If it should grow very warm you'd be
roasted to death.''Then I don't know what to do,' say you.'What is the
matter with going both ways?'says the Quandary, to which you reply,
'How can I do that?'Then," continued the
major, his voice sinking to a whisper--"then you do try it and you do
see, unless you are a wise, sagacious, sapient, perspicacious, astute,
canny, penetrating, needle-witted, learned man of wisdom like myself who
knows a thing or two.In that case you don't try, for you can see
without trying that any man with two legs who tries to walk along two
roads leading in different directions at once is just going to split
into at least two halves before he has gone twenty miles, and that is
just what the Quandary wants you to do, for it's over such horrible
spectacles as a man divided against himself that he gloats, and when he
is through gloating he swallows what's left.""And what does the wise, sagacious, sappy, perspiring man of wisdom like
yourself who knows a thing or two do?""I didn't say sappy or perspiring," retorted the major."I said sapient
and perspicacious.""Well, anyhow, what does he do?""He gives up going to Calcutta," observed the major.To gain a victory over the Quandary you turn and run away?"I cried for help, turned about,
and ran back here, and I can tell you it takes a brave man to turn his
back on an enemy," said the major."And why didn't the soldiers do it too?""There wasn't anybody to order a retreat, so when the Quandary attacked
them they marched right on, single file, and every one of 'em split in
two, fell in a heap, and died.""But I should think you would have ordered them to halt," insisted
Jimmieboy."I had no power to do so," the major replied."If I had only had the
power, I might have saved their lives by ordering them to march two by
two instead of single file, and then when they met the Quandary they
could have gone right ahead, the left-hand men taking the left-hand
road, the right-hand men the right, but of course I only had orders to
tell them to come back here, and a soldier can only obey his orders.It
was awful the way those noble lives were sacrifi--"

Here Jimmieboy started to his feet with a cry of alarm.There were
unmistakable sounds of approaching footsteps."Somebody or something is coming," he cried."Oh, no, I guess not," said the major, getting red in the face, for he
recognized, as Jimmieboy did not, the firm, steady tread of the
returning soldiers whom he had told Jimmieboy the Quandary had
annihilated."It's only the drum of your ear you hear," he added."You
know you have a drum in your ear, and every once in a while it begins
its rub-a-dub-dub just like any other drum.Oh, no, you don't hear
anybody coming.Let's take a walk into the forest here and see if we
can't find a few pipe plants.I think I'd like to have a smoke."cried Jimmieboy, shaking his arm, which his
companion had taken, free from the major's grasp."You've been telling
me a great big fib, because there are the soldiers coming back again."ejaculated the major, in well-affected surprise.Why, do you know, general, that is the
most marvelous cure I ever saw in my life.To think that all those men
whom I saw not an hour ago lying dead on the field of battle, all ready
for the Quandary's luncheon, should have been resusitated in so short a
time, as--"

"Halt!"roared Jimmieboy, interrupting the major in a most
unceremonious fashion, for the soldiers by this time had reached a point
in the road directly opposite where he was sitting.cried Jimmieboy, after the corporal had told him the
proper order to give next.The soldiers broke ranks, and in sheer weariness threw themselves down
on the soft turf at the side of the road--all except the corporal, who
at Jimmieboy's request came and sat down at the general's side to make
his report."This is fine weather we are having, corporal," said the major, winking
at the subordinate officer, and trying to make him understand that the
less he said about the major the better it would be for all concerned."Better for sleeping than for military
duty, eh, major?"Here the major grew pale, but had the presence of mind to remark that he
thought it might rain in time for tea."There's something behind all this," thought Jimmieboy; "and I'm going
to know what it all means."Then he said aloud, "You have had a very speedy recovery, corporal."Here the major cleared his throat more loudly than usual, blushed rosy
red, and winked twice as violently at the corporal as before."Did you ever hear my poem on the 'Cold Tea River in China'?""No," said the corporal, "I never did, and I never want to.""Then I will recite it for you," said the major."After the corporal has made his report, major," said Jimmieboy."It goes this way," continued the major, pretending not to hear."Some years ago--'way back in '69--a
     Friend and I went for a trip through China,
     That pleasant land where rules King Tommy Chang,
     Where flows the silver river Yangtse-Wang--
       Through fertile fields, through sweetest-scented bowers
       Of creeping vinous vines and floral flowers.""My dear major," interrupted Jimmieboy, "I do not want to hurt your
feelings, but much as I like to hear your poetry I must listen to the
report of the corporal first.""Oh, very well," returned the major, observing that the corporal had
taken to his heels as soon as he had begun to recite.Jimmieboy then saw for the first time that the corporal had fled."I do not know," returned the major, coldly."I fancy he has gone to the
kitchen to cook his report."Oh, well, never mind," said Jimmieboy, noticing that the major was
evidently very much hurt."Go on with the poem about 'Cold Tea River.'""No, I shall not," replied the major."I shall not do it for two
reasons, general, unless you as my superior officer command me to do it,
and I hope you will not.In the first place, you have publicly
humiliated me in the presence of a tin corporal, an inferior in rank,
and consequently have hurt my feelings more deeply than you imagine.I
am not tall, sir, but my feelings are deep enough to be injured most
deeply, and in view of that fact I prefer to say nothing more about that
poem.The other reason is that there is really no such poem, because
there is really no such a stream as Cold Tea River in China, though
there might have been had Nature been as poetic and fanciful as I, for
it is as easy to conceive of a river having its source in the land of
the tea-trees, and having its waters so full of the essence of tea
gained from contact with the roots of those trees, that to all intents
and purposes it is a river of tea.Had you permitted me to go on
uninterrupted I should have made up a poem on that subject, and might
possibly by this time have had it done, but as it is, it never will be
composed.If you will permit me I will take a horseback ride and see if
I cannot forget the trials of this memorable day.If I return I shall be
back, but otherwise you may never see me again.I feel so badly over
your treatment of me that I may be rash enough to commit suicide by
jumping into a smelting-pot and being moulded over again into a piece of
shot, and if I do, general, if I do, and if I ever get into battle and
am fired out of a gun, I shall seek out that corporal, and use my best
efforts to amputate his head off so quickly that he won't know what has
happened till he tries to think, and finds he hasn't anything to do it
with."Breathing which horrible threat, the major mounted his horse and
galloped madly down the road, and Jimmieboy, not knowing whether to be
sorry or amused, started on a search for the corporal in order that he
might hear his report, and gain, if possible, some solution of the
major's strange conduct.THE CORPORAL'S FAIRY STORY.Jimmieboy had not long to search for the corporal.He found that worthy
in a very few minutes, lying fast asleep under a tree some twenty or
thirty rods down the road, snoring away as if his life depended upon it.It was quite evident that the poor fellow was worn out with his
exertions, and Jimmieboy respected his weariness, and restrained his
strong impulse to awaken him.His consideration for the tired soldier was not without its reward, for
as Jimmieboy listened the corporal's snores took semblance to words,
which, as he remembered them, the snores of his papa in the early
morning had never done.Indeed, Jimmieboy and his small brother Russ
were agreed on the one point that their father's snores were about the
most uninteresting, uncalled for, unmeaning sounds in the world, which,
no doubt, was why they made it a point to interrupt them on every
possible occasion.The novelty of the present situation was delightful
to the little general.To be able to stand there and comprehend what it
was the corporal was snoring so vociferously, was most pleasing, and he
was still further entertained to note that it was nothing less than a
rollicking song that was having its sweetness wasted upon the desert air
by the sleeping officer before him.This is the song that Jimmieboy heard:

    "I would not be a man of peace,
         Oh, no-ho-ho--not I;
     But give me battles without cease;
     Give me grim war with no release,
         Or let me die-hi-hi.I love the frightful things we eat
         In times of war-or-or;
     The biscuit tough, the granite meat,
     And hard green apples are a treat
         Which I adore-dor-dor.I love the sound of roaring guns
         Upon my e-e-ears,
     I love in routs the lengthy runs,
     I do not mind the stupid puns
         Of dull-ull grenadiers.I should not weep to lose a limb,
         An arm, or thumb-bum-bum.I laugh with glee to hear the zim
     Of shells that make my chance seem slim
         Of getting safe back hum.Just let me sniff gunpowder in
         My nasal fee-a-ture,
     And I will ever sing and grin.To me sweet music is the din
         Of war, you may be sure.""If my dear old papa could snore
songs like that, wouldn't I let him sleep mornings!""He does," snored the corporal."The only trouble is he doesn't snore as
clearly as I do.It takes long practice to become a fluent snorer like
myself--that is to say, a snorer who can be understood by any one
whatever his age, nation, or position in life.That song I have just
snored for you could be understood by a Zulu just as well as you
understood it, because a snore is exactly the same in Zuluese as it is
in your language or any other--in which respect it resembles a cup of
coffee or a canary-bird.""Are you still snoring, or is this English you are speaking?""Snoring; and that proves just what I said, for you understood me just
as plainly as though I had spoken in English," returned the corporal,
his eyes still tightly closed in sleep."Snore me another poem," said Jimmieboy."No, I won't do that; but if you wish me to I'll snore you a fairy
tale," answered the corporal."That will be lovely," said Jimmieboy."Very well," observed the corporal, turning over on his back and
throwing his head back into an uncomfortable position so that he could
snore more loudly.Once upon a time there was a small boy
named Tom whose parents were so poor and so honest that they could not
afford to give him money enough to go to the circus when it came to
town, which made him very wretched and unhappy, because all the other
little boys who lived thereabouts were more fortunately situated, and
had bought tickets for the very first performance.Tom cried all night
and went about the town moaning all day, for he did want to see the
elephant whose picture was on the fences that could hold itself up on
its hind tail; the man who could toss five-hundred-pound cannon balls in
the air and catch them on top of his head as they came down; the trick
horse that could jump over a fence forty feet high without disturbing
the two-year-old wonder Pattycake who sat in a rocking-chair on his
back.As Tom very well said, these were things one had to see to
believe, and now they were coming, and just because he could not get
fifty cents he could not see them.why can't I go out into the world, and by hard
work earn the fifty cents I so much need to take me through the doors of
the circus tent into the presence of these marvelous creatures?'"And he went out and called upon a great lawyer and asked him if he did
not want a partner in his business for a day, but the lawyer only
laughed and told him to go to the doctor and ask him.So Tom went to the
doctor, and the doctor said he did not want a partner, but he did want a
boy to take medicines for him and tell him what they tasted like, and he
promised Tom fifty cents if he would be that boy for a day, and Tom said
he would try."Then the doctor got out his medicine-chest and gave Tom twelve bottles
of medicine, and told him to taste each one of them, and Tom tasted two
of them, and decided that he would rather do without the circus than
taste the rest, so the doctor bade him farewell, and Tom went to look
for something else to do.As he walked disconsolately down the street
and saw by the clock that it was nearly eleven o'clock, he made up his
mind that he would think no more about the circus, but would go home and
study arithmetic instead, the chance of his being able to earn the
fifty cents seemed so very slight.So he turned back, and was about to
go to his home, when he caught sight of another circus poster, which
showed how the fiery, untamed giraffe caught cocoanuts in his mouth--the
cocoanuts being fired out of a cannon set off by a clown who looked as
if he could make a joke that would make an owl laugh.He couldn't miss that without at least making one further
effort to earn the money that would pay for his ticket."So off he started again in search of profitable employment.He had not
gone far when he came to a crockery shop, and on stopping to look in the
large shop window at the beautiful dishes and graceful soup tureens that
were to be seen there, he saw a sign on which was written in great
golden letters 'BOY WANTED.'Now Tom could not read, but something told
him that that sign was a good omen for him, so he went into the shop and
asked if they had any work that a boy of his size could do."'Yes,' said the owner of the shop."Tom answered bravely that he thought he was, and the man said he would
give him a trial anyhow, and sent him off on a sample errand, telling
him that if he did that one properly, he would pay him fifty cents a
day for as many days as he kept him, giving him a half holiday on all
circus-days.Tom was delighted, and started off gleefully to perform
the sample errand, which was to take a basketful of china plates to the
house of a rich merchant who lived four miles back in the country.Bravely the little fellow plodded along until he came to the gate-way
of the rich man's place, when so overcome was he with happiness at
getting something to do that he could not wait to get the gate open,
but leaped like a deer clear over the topmost pickets.his
very happiness was his ruin, for as he landed on the other side the
china plates flew out of the basket in every direction, and falling on
the hard gravel path were broken every one."cried Jimmieboy, sympathetically."Whereat the cow
        Remarked, 'Pray how--
     If what you say is true--
         How should the child,
         However mild,
     Become so wildly blue?'"asked Jimmieboy, very much surprised at
the rhyme, which, so far as he could see, had nothing to do with the
fairy story."There wasn't anything about a cow in the fairy story you were telling
about Tom," said Jimmieboy."Then you must have interrupted me," snored the corporal."You must
never interrupt a person who is snoring until he gets through, because
the chances are nine out of ten that, being asleep, he won't remember
what he has been snoring about, and will go off on something else
entirely."You had got to where Tom jumped over the gate and broke all the china
plates," answered Jimmieboy.I'll go on, but don't you say another thing until I
have finished," said the corporal.Then resuming his story, he snored
away as follows: "And falling on the hard gravel path the plates were
broken every one, which was awfully sad, as any one could understand
who could see how the poor little fellow threw himself down on the grass
and wept.He wept so long and such great tears,
that the grass about him for yards and yards looked as fresh and green
as though there had been a rain-storm.cried Tom, ruefully regarding the
shattered plates.'They'll beat me if I go back to the shop, and I'll
never get to see the circus after all.''They will not beat you, and I will see that you
get to the circus.'asked Tom, looking up and seeing before him a beautiful
lady, who looked as if she might be a part of the circus herself.'Are
you the lady with the iron jaw or the horseback lady that jumps through
hoops of fire?''I am your Fairy Godmother, and I have
come to tell you that if you will gather up the broken plates and take
them up to the great house yonder, I will fix it so that you can go to
the circus.'"'Won't they scold me for breaking the plates?'asked Tom, his eyes
brightening and his tears drying."'Take them and see,' said the Fairy Godmother, and Tom, who was always
an obedient lad, did as he was told.He gathered up the broken plates,
put them in his basket, and went up to the house."'Here are your plates,' he said, all of a tremble as he entered."'Let's see if any of them are broken,' said the merchant in a voice so
gruff that Tom trembled all the harder.Surely he was now in worse
trouble than ever.said the rich man taking one out and looking at it."'Yes,' said Tom, meekly, surprised to note that the plate was as good
as ever.roared the rich man, who didn't want mended plates.stammered Tom, who saw that he had made a bad mistake.'That is, I didn't mean to say mended.I meant to say that they'd been
very highly recommended.'The rest of them seem to be all right, too.Here, take your
basket and go along with you."And so Tom left the merchant's house very much pleased to have got out
of his scrape so easily, and feeling very grateful to his Fairy
Godmother for having helped him."'Well,' said she, when he got back to the gate where she was awaiting
him, 'was everything all right?''The plates were all right, and now they are
all left.'"The Fairy Godmother laughed and said he was a bright boy, and then she
asked him which he would rather do: pay fifty cents to go to the circus
once, or wear the coat of invisibility and walk in and out as many times
as he wanted to.To this Tom, who was a real boy, and preferred going to
the circus six times to going only once, replied that as he was afraid
he might lose the fifty cents he thought he would take the coat, though
he also thought, he said, if his dear Fairy Godmother could find it in
her heart to let him have both the coat and the fifty cents he could
find use for them."At this the Fairy Godmother laughed again, and said she guessed he
could, and, giving him two shining silver quarters and the coat of
invisibility, she made a mysterious remark, which he could not
understand, and disappeared.Tom kissed his hand toward the spot where
she had stood, now vacant, and ran gleefully homeward, happy as a bird,
for he had at last succeeded in obtaining the means for his visit to the
circus.That night, so excited was he, he hardly slept a wink, and even
when he did sleep, he dreamed of such unpleasant things as the bitter
medicines of the doctor and the broken plates, so that it was just as
well he should spend the greater part of the night awake."His excitement continued until the hour for going to the circus
arrived, when he put on his coat of invisibility and started.To test
the effect of the coat he approached one of his chums, who was standing
in the middle of the long line of boys waiting for the doors to open,
and tweaked his nose, deciding from the expression on his friend's
face--one of astonishment, alarm, and mystification--that he really was
invisible, and so, proceeding to the gates, he passed by the
ticket-taker into the tent without interference from any one.It was
simply lovely; all the seats in the place were unoccupied, and he could
have his choice of them."You may be sure he chose one well down in front, so that he should miss
no part of the performance, and then he waited for the beginning of the
very wonderful series of things that were to come.poor Tom was again doomed to a very mortifying disappointment.He
forgot that his invisibility made his lovely front seat appear to be
unoccupied, and while he was looking off in another direction a great,
heavy, fat man entered and sat down upon him, squeezing him so hard that
he could scarcely breathe, and as for howling, that was altogether out
of the question, and there through the whole performance the fat man
sat, and the invisible Tom saw not one of the marvelous acts or the
wonderful animals, and, what was worse, when a joke was got off he
couldn't see whether it was by the clown or the ring-master, and so
didn't know when to laugh even if he had wanted to.It was the most
dreadful disappointment Tom ever had, and he went home crying, and spent
the night groaning and moaning with sorrow."It was not until he began to dress for breakfast next morning, and his
two beautiful quarters rolled out of his pocket on the floor, that he
remembered he still had the means to go again.When he had made this
discovery he became happy once more, and started off with his invisible
coat hanging over his arm, and paid his way in for the second and last
performance like all the other boys.This time he saw all there was to
be seen, and was full of happiness, until the lions' cage was brought
in, when he thought it would be a fine thing to put on his invisible
coat, and enter the cage with the lion-tamer, which he did, having so
exciting a time looking at the lions and keeping out of their way that
he forgot to watch the tamer when he went out, so that finally when the
circus was all over Tom found himself locked in the cage with the lions
with nothing but raw meat to eat.This was bad enough, but what was
worse, the next city in which the circus was to exhibit was hundreds of
miles away from the town in which Tom lived, and no one was expected to
open the cage doors again for four weeks."When Tom heard this he was frightened to death almost, and rather than
spend all that time shut up in a small cage with the kings of the
beasts, he threw off the coat of invisibility and shrieked, and then--"

"Yes--then what?"cried Jimmieboy, breathlessly, so excited that he
could not help interrupting the corporal, despite the story-teller's
warning."The bull-dog said he thought it might,
       But pussy she said 'Nay,'
     At which the unicorn took fright,
       And stole a bale of hay,"

snored the corporal with a yawn.cried Jimmieboy, so excited to
hear what happened to little Tom in the lions' cage that he began to
shake the corporal almost fiercely.asked the corporal, sitting up and opening his
eyes."What are you trying to talk about, general?""Tom--and the circus--what happened to him in the lions' cage when he
took off his coat?"I don't know anything about any Tom or any
circus," replied the corporal, with a sleepy nod."But you've just been snoring to me about it," remonstrated Jimmieboy."Don't remember it at all," said the corporal."I must have been asleep
and dreamed it, or else you did, or maybe both of us did; but tell me,
general, in confidence now, and don't ever tell anybody I
asked you, have you such a thing as a--as a gum-drop in your pocket?"And Jimmieboy was so put out with the corporal for waking up just at
the wrong time that he wouldn't answer him, but turned on his heel, and
walked away very much concerned in his mind as to the possible fate of
poor little Tom.It cannot be said that Jimmieboy was entirely happy after his falling
out with the corporal.Of course it was very inconsiderate of the
corporal to wake up at the most exciting period of his fairy story, and
leave his commanding officer in a state of uncertainty as to the fate of
little Tom; but as he walked along the road, and thought the matter all
over, Jimmieboy reflected that after all he was himself as much to blame
as the corporal.In the first place, he had interrupted him in his story
at the point where it became most interesting, though warned in advance
not to do so, and in the second, he had not fallen back upon his
undoubted right as a general to command the corporal to go to sleep
again, and to stay so until his little romance was finished to the
satisfaction of his superior officer.The latter was without question
the thing he should have done, and at first he thought he would go back
and tell the corporal he was very sorry he hadn't done so.Indeed, he
would have gone back had he not met, as he rounded the turn, a
singular-looking little fellow, who, sitting high in an oak-tree at the
side of the road, attracted his attention by winking at him.Ordinarily
Jimmieboy would not have noticed anybody who winked at him, because his
papa had told him that people who would wink would smoke a pipe, which
was very wrong, particularly in people who were as small as this droll
person in the tree.But the singular-looking little fellow winked aloud,
and Jimmieboy could not help noticing him.Like most small boys
Jimmieboy delighted in noises, especially noises that went off like
pop-guns, which was just the kind of noise the tree dwarf made when he
winked.said Jimmieboy, as the sounds first attracted his
attention."Sitting on a limb and counting the stars in the sky," answered the
dwarf."There are, really," said the dwarf."There's more than that," said Jimmieboy."I've had stories told me of
twenty-seven or twenty-eight.""That doesn't prove anything," returned the dwarf, "that is, nothing but
what I said.If there are twenty-eight there must be seventeen, so you
can't catch me up on that.""I can't come now," returned the dwarf."I'm too busy counting the
eighteenth star, but I'll drop my telescope and let you see me through
that.""I'll help you count the stars if you come," put in Jimmieboy."How many
stars can you count a day?""Oh, about one and a half," said the dwarf."I could count more than
that, only I'm cross-eyed and see double, so that after I've got through
counting, I have to divide the whole number by two to get the proper
figures, and I never was good at dividing.I've always hated
division--particularly division of apples and peaches.There is no
meaner sum in any arithmetic in the world than that I used to have to
do every time I got an apple when I was your age.""It was to divide one apple by three boys," returned the queer little
man."Most generally that would be regarded as a case of three into one,
but in this instance it was one into three; and, worse than all, while
it pretended to be division, and was as hard as division, as far as I
was concerned it was subtraction too, and I was always the leftest part
of the remainder.""But I don't see why you had to divide your apples every time you got
any," said Jimmieboy."That's easy enough to explain," said the dwarf."If I didn't divide,
and did eat the whole apple, I'd have a fearful pain in my heart;
whereas if I gave my little brothers each a third, it would often happen
that they would get the pain and not I. After one or two experiments I
fixed it so that I never got the pain part any more--for you know every
apple has an ache in it--and they did, so, you see, I kept myself well
as could be, and at the same time built up quite a reputation for
generosity.""How did you fix it so as to give them the pain part always?""Why, I located the part of the apple that held the pain.I did not
divide one apple I got, but ate the whole thing myself, part by part.I
studied each part carefully, and discovered that apples are divided by
Nature into three parts, anyhow.Pleasure was one part, pain was another
part, and the third part was just nothing--neither pleasure nor pain.The core is where the ache is, the crisp is where the pleasure is, and
the skin represents the part which isn't anything.When I found that out
I said, 'Here!What is a good enough plan for Nature is a good enough
plan for me.I'll divide my apples on Nature's plan.'To
one brother I gave the core; to the other the skin; the rest I ate
myself.""It was very mean of you to make your brothers suffer the pain," said
Jimmieboy.One time one brother'd have the core;
another time the other brother'd have it.They took turns," said the
dwarf.cried Jimmieboy, who was so fond of his own
little brother that he would gladly have borne all his pains for him if
it could have been arranged."Well, meanness is my business," said the dwarf.echoed Jimmieboy, opening his eyes wide with
astonishment, meanness seemed such a strange business."You know what a fairy is, don't you?"It's a dear lovely creature with wings, that goes about doing
good."An unfairy is just the opposite," explained the dwarf.I am the fairy that makes things go wrong.When your hat blows off in the street the chances are that I have paid
the bellows man, who works up all these big winds we have, to do it.If
I see people having a good time on a picnic, I fly up to the sky and
push a rain cloud over where they are and drench them, having first of
course either hidden or punched great holes in their umbrellas.Oh, I
can tell you, I am the meanest creature that ever was.Why, do you know
what I did once in a country school?""No, I don't," said Jimmieboy, in tones of disgust."I don't know
anything about mean things.""Well, you ought to know about this," returned the dwarf, "because it
was just the meanest thing anybody ever did.There was a boy who'd
studied awfully hard in hopes that he would lead his class when the
holidays came, and there was another boy in the school who was equal to
him in everything but arithmetic, and who would have been beaten on that
one point, so that the other boy would have stood where he wanted to,
only I helped the second boy by rubbing out all the correct answers of
the first boy and putting others on the slate instead, so that the first
boy lost first place and had to take second."It was horrid," said Jimmieboy, "and it's a good thing you didn't come
down here when I asked you to, for if you had, I think I should now be
slapping you just as hard as I could.""Another time," said the unfairy, ignoring Jimmieboy's remark, "I turned
myself into a horse-fly and bothered a lame horse; then I changed into a
bull-dog and barked all night under the window of a man who wanted to go
to sleep, but my regular trick is going around to hat stores and taking
the brushes and brushing all the beaver hats the wrong way.Sometimes
when people get lost here in the woods and want to go to
Tiddledywinkland, I give them the wrong directions, so that they bring
up on the other side of the country, where they don't want to be; and
once last winter I put rust on the runners of a little boy's sled so
that he couldn't use it, and then when he'd spent three days getting
them polished up, I pushed a warm rain cloud over the hill where the
snow was and melted it all away.I hide toys I know children will be
sure to want; I tear the most exciting pages out of books; I spill salt
in the sugar-bowls and plant weeds in the gardens; I upset the ink on
love-letters; when I find a man with only one collar I fray it at the
edges; I roll collar buttons under bureaus; I--"

"Don't you dare tell me another thing!""I
don't like you, and I won't listen to you any more.""Oh, yes, you will," replied the unfairy."I am just mean enough to make
you, and I'll tell you why.I am very tired of my business, and I think
if I tell you all the horrid things I do, maybe you'll tell me how I can
keep from doing them.I have known you for a long time, only you didn't
know it.""I don't believe it," said Jimmieboy."Well, I have, just the same," returned the dwarf.Do you remember, one day you went out walking, how you walked two miles
and only met one mud-puddle, and fell into that?""Yes, I do," said Jimmieboy, sadly."I spoiled my new suit when I fell,
and I never knew how I came to do it.""I grabbed hold of
your foot, and upset you right into it.I waited two hours to do it,
too.""Well, I wish I had an axe.I'd chop that
tree down, and catch you and make you sorry for it.""I am sorry for it," said the dwarf.I've never ceased to
regret it.""Oh, well, I forgive you," said Jimmieboy, "if you are really sorry.""Yes, I am," said the dwarf; "I'm awfully sorry, because I didn't do it
right.You only ruined your suit and not that beautiful red necktie you
had on.Next time I'll be more careful and spoil everything.But let me
give you more proof that I've known you.Who do you suppose it was bent
your railway tracks at Christmas so they wouldn't work?""I did, and, what is more, it was I
who chewed up your best shoes and bit your plush dog's head off; it was
I who ate up your luncheon one day last March; it was I who pawed up all
the geraniums in your flower-bed; and it was I who nipped your friend
the postman in the leg on St.Valentine's day so that he lost your
valentine.""I've caught you there," said Jimmieboy."It wasn't you that did those
things at all.It was a horrid little brown dog that used to play around
our house did all that.""You think you are smart," laughed the dwarf."I don't see how you can have any friends if that is the way you
behave," said Jimmieboy, after a minute or two of silence."No," said the dwarf, his voice trembling a little--for as Jimmieboy
peered up into the tree at him he could see that he was crying just a
bit--"I haven't any, and I never had.I never had anybody to set me a
good example.My father and my mother were unfairies before me, and I
just grew to be one like them.I didn't want to be one, but I had to be;
and really it wasn't until I saw you pat a hand-organ monkey on the
head, instead of giving him a piece of cake with red pepper on it, as I
would have done, that I ever even dreamed that there were kind people in
the world.After I'd watched you for a while and had seen how happy you
were, and how many friends you had, I began to see how it was that I was
so miserable.I was miserable because I was mean, but nobody has ever
told me how not to be mean, and I'm just real upset over it.""I am really very, very
sorry for you.""So am I," sobbed the dwarf."Perhaps I can," said Jimmieboy."Well, wait a minute," said the dwarf, drying his eyes and peering
intently down the road.There is a sheep down the road
there tangled up in the brambles.Wait until I change myself into a big
black dog and scare her half to death.""But that will be mean," returned Jimmieboy; "and if you want to change,
and be good, and kind, why don't you begin now and help the sheep out?""Now that is an idea, isn't it!Do you know, I'd
never have thought of that if you hadn't suggested it to me.I'll change myself into a good-hearted shepherd's boy, and free
that poor animal at once!"The dwarf was as good as his word, and in a moment he came back, smiling
as happily as though he had made a great fortune."Why, it's lovely to do a thing like that."Do you
know, Jimmieboy, I've half a mind to turn mean again for just a minute,
and go back and frighten that sheep back into the bushes just for the
bliss of helping her out once more.""I wouldn't do that," said Jimmieboy, with a shake of his head."I'd
just change myself into a good fairy if I were you, and go about doing
kind things.When you see people having a picnic, push the rain cloud
away from them instead of over them.Do just the opposite from what
you've been doing all along, and pretty soon you'll have heaps and heaps
of friends.""You are a wonderful boy," said the dwarf."Why, you've hit without
thinking a minute the plan I've been searching for for years and years
and years, and I'll do just what you say.The dwarf pronounced one or two queer words the like of which Jimmieboy
had never heard before, and, presto change!quick as a wink the unfairy
had disappeared, and there stood at the small general's side the
handsomest, sweetest little sprite he had ever even dreamed or read
about.The sprite threw his arms about Jimmieboy's neck and kissed him
affectionately, wiped a tear of joy from his eye, and then said:

"I am so glad I met you.You have taught me how to be happy, and I am
sure I have lost eighteen hundred and seven tons in weight, I feel so
light and gay; and--joy!"Straight as--straight as--well, as straight
as your hair is curly."And that was as good an illustration as he could have found, for the
sprite's hair was just as curly as it could be."Where are you going, Jimmieboy?"asked the sprite, after they had
walked along in silence for a few minutes."I haven't the slightest idea," said Jimmieboy, with a short laugh."I
started out to provision the forces before pursuing the Parawelopipedon,
but I seem to have fallen out with everybody who could show me where to
go, and I am all at sea.""Well, you haven't fallen out with me," said the sprite."In fact,
you've fallen in with me, so that you are on dry land again.I'll show
you where to go, if you want me to.""Then you know where I can find the candied cherries and other things
that soldiers eat?""No, I don't know where you can find anything of the sort," returned the
sprite."But I do know that all things come to him who waits, so I'd
advise you to wait until the candied cherries and so forth come to you.""But what'll I do while I am waiting?"asked Jimmieboy, who had no wish
to be idle in this new and strange country."Follow me, of course," said the sprite, "and I'll show you the most
wonderful things you ever saw.I'll take you up to see old
Fortyforefoot, the biggest giant in all the world; after that we'll stop
in at Alltart's bakery and have lunch.It's a great bakery, Alltart's
is.You just wish for any kind of cake in the world, and you have it in
your mouth.""Let's go there first, I'm afraid of giants," said Jimmieboy."Well, I don't blame them for that," said the sprite."A little boy as
sweet as you are is almost too good not to eat; but I'll take care of
you.Fortyforefoot I haven't a doubt would like to eat both of us, but I
have a way of getting the best of fellows of that sort, so if you'll
come along you needn't have the slightest fear for your safety.""All right," said Jimmieboy, after thinking it all over.At this moment the galloping step of a horse was heard approaching, and
in a minute Major Blueface rode up."Why, how do you do, general?"he cried, his face beaming with pleasure
as he reined in his steed and dismounted."I haven't seen you
in--my!--why, not in years, sir."Quite well," said Jimmieboy, with a smile, for the major amused him
very much."It doesn't seem more than five minutes since I saw you
last," he added, with a sly wink at the sprite."Oh, it must be longer than that," said the major, gravely."It must be
at least ten, but they have seemed years to me--a seeming, sir, that is
well summed up in that lovely poem a friend of mine wrote some time ago:

    "'When I have quarreled with a dear
     Old friend, a minute seems a year;
     And you'll remember without doubt
     That when we parted we fell out.'"Reminds me of the
poems of Major Blueface."Yes," said the major, frowning at the sprite, whom he had never met
before."I have heard of Major Blueface, and not only have I heard of
him, but I am also one of his warmest friends and admirers."said the sprite, not noticing apparently that Jimmieboy was
nearly exploding with mirth.What sort of a person is the
major, sir?"returned the major, his chest swelling with pride."Brave as a
lobster, witty as a porcupine, and handsome as a full-blown rose.Many a time have I been with him on the field of
battle, where a man most truly shows what he is, and there it was, sir,
that I learned to love and admire Major Blueface.Why, once I saw that
man hit square in the back by the full charge of a brass cannon loaded
to the muzzle with dried pease.The force of the blow was
tremendous--forcible enough, sir, in fact, to knock the major off his
feet, but he never quailed.He rose with dignity, and walked back to
where the enemy was standing, and dared him to do it again, and when the
enemy did it again, the major did not forget, as some soldiers would
have done under the circumstances, that he was a gentleman, but he rose
up a second time and thanked the enemy for his courtesy, which so won
the enemy's heart that he surrendered at once.""Hero is no name for it, sir.On
another occasion which I recall," cried the major, with enthusiasm, "on
another occasion he was pursued by a lion around a circular path--he is
a magnificent runner, the major is--and he ran so much faster than the
lion that he soon caught up with his pursuer from the rear, and with one
blow of his sword severed the raging beast's tail from his body.Then he
sat down and waited until the lion got around to him again, his appetite
increased so by the exercise he had taken that he would have eaten
anything, and then what do you suppose that brave soldier did?"asked Jimmieboy, who had stopped laughing to listen."He gave the hungry creature his own tail to eat, and then went home,"
returned the major."Do you think I would tell an untrue story?""Not at all," said the sprite; "but if the major told it to you, it may
have grown just a little bit every time you told it."That could not be, for I am Major Blueface himself,"
interrupted the major."Then you are a brave man," said the sprite, "and I am proud to meet
you.""Thank you," said the major, his frown disappearing and his pleasant
smile returning."I have heard that remark before; but it is always
pleasant to hear.he added,
turning and addressing Jimmieboy."I am still searching for the provisions, major," returned Jimmieboy."The soldiers were so tired I hadn't the heart to command them to get
them for me, as you said, so I am as badly off as ever.""I think you need a rest," said the major, gravely; "and while it is
extremely important that the forces should be provided with all the
canned goods necessary to prolong their lives, the health of the
commanding officer is also a most precious consideration.As
commander-in-chief why don't you grant yourself a ten years' vacation on
full pay, and at the end of that time return to the laborious work you
have undertaken, refreshed?""If I go off, there
won't be any war.""That'll spite the enemy just
as much as it will our side; and maybe he'll get so tired waiting for
us to begin that he'll lie down and die or else give himself up.""Well, I don't know what to do," said Jimmieboy, very much perplexed."I'd hire some one else to take my place if I were you, and let him do
the fighting and provisioning until you are all ready," said the sprite."The Giant Fortyforefoot," returned the sprite.He's a great warrior in the first place and a great magician in the
second.He can do the most wonderful tricks you ever saw in all your
life.For instance,

    "He'll take two ordinary balls,
       He'll toss 'em to the sky,
     And each when to the earth it falls
       Will be a satin tie.He'll take a tricycle in hand,
       He'll give the thing a heave,
     He'll mutter some queer sentence, and
       'Twill go right up his sleeve.He'll ask you what your name may be,
       And if you answer 'Jim!'He'll turn a handspring--one, two, three!He'll take a fifty-dollar bill,
       He'll tie it to a chain,
     He'll cry out 'Presto!'and you will
       Not see your bill again.""I'd like to see him," said Jimmieboy."But I can't say I want to be
eaten up, you know, and I'd like to have you tell me before we go how
you are going to prevent his eating me.""You suffer under the great
disadvantage of being a very toothsome, tender morsel, and in all
probability Fortyforefoot would order you stewed in cream or made over
into a tart.added the major, smacking his lips so suggestively
that Jimmieboy drew away from him, slightly alarmed."Why, it makes my
mouth water to think of a pudding made of you, with a touch of cinnamon
and a dash of maple syrup, and a shake of sawdust and a hard sauce.This last word of the major's was a sort of ecstatic cluck such as boys
often make after having tasted something they are particularly fond of."What's the use of scaring the boy, Blueface?"said the sprite, angrily,
as he noted Jimmieboy's alarm.You can be
as brave and terrible as you please in the presence of your enemies, but
in the presence of my friends you've got to behave yourself."Why, he could rout me
with a frown.His little finger could, unaided, put me to flight if it
felt so disposed.I was complimenting him--not trying to frighten him."When I went into ecstasies
       O'er pudding made of him,
     'Twas just because I wished to please
       The honorable Jim;
     And now, in spite of your rebuff,
       The statement I repeat:
     I think he's really good enough
       For any one to eat.""Well, that's different," said the sprite, accepting the major's
statement."I quite agree with you there; but when you go clucking
around here like a hen who has just tasted the sweetest grain of corn
she ever had, or like a boy after eating a plate of ice-cream, you're
just a bit terrifying--particularly to the appetizing morsel that has
given rise to those clucks.It's enough to make the stoutest heart
quail."retorted the major, with a wink at Jimmieboy."Neither my
manner nor the manner of any other being could make a stout hart quail,
because stout harts are deer and quails are birds!"This more or less feeble joke served to put the three travelers in good
humor again.Jimmieboy smiled over it; the sprite snickered, and the
major threw himself down on the grass in a perfect paroxysm of laughter.When he had finished he got up again and said:

"Well, what are we going to do about it?I propose we attack
Fortyforefoot unawares and tie his hands behind his back."You are a wonderfully wise person," retorted the sprite."How on earth
is Fortyforefoot to show his tricks if we tie his hands?""By means of his tricks," returned the major."If he is any kind of a
magician he'll get his hands free in less than a minute.""I'm not good at
conundrums," said the major."I'm sure I don't know," returned the sprite, impatiently."Then why waste time asking riddles to which you don't know the answer?""You'll have me mad in a minute, and when I'm mad woe
be unto him which I'm angry at.""Don't quarrel," said Jimmieboy, stepping between his two friends, with
whom it seemed to be impossible to keep peace for any length of time."If you quarrel I shall leave you both and go back to my company."But he
mustn't do it again.Now as you have chosen to reject my plan of
attacking Fortyforefoot and tying his hands, suppose you suggest
something better, Mr."I think the safe thing would be for Jimmieboy to wear this invisible
coat of mine when in the giant's presence.If Fortyforefoot can't see
him he is safe," said the sprite."I don't see any invisible coat anywhere," said the major."Nobody can see it, of course," said the sprite, scornfully."Yes, I do," retorted the major."I only pretended I didn't so that I
could make you ask the question, which enables me to say that something
invisible is something you can't see, like your jokes.""I can make a better joke than you can with my hands tied behind my
back," snapped the sprite."I can't make jokes with your hands tied behind your back, but I can
make one with my own hands tied behind my back that Jimmieboy here can
see with his eyes shut," said the major, scornfully."Why--er--let me see; why--er--when is a sunbeam sharp?"asked the
major, who did not expect to be taken up so quickly."Bad as can be," said the sprite, his nose turned up until it interfered
with his eyesight.When is a joke not a
joke?""Haven't the slightest idea," observed Jimmieboy, after scratching his
head and trying to think for a minute or two."When it's one of the major's," roared the sprite, whereat the woods
rang with his laughter.The major first turned pale and then grew red in the face."That settles it," he said, throwing off his coat."That is a deadly
insult, and there is now no possible way to avoid a duel.""I am ready for you at any time," said the sprite, calmly."Only as the
challenged party I have the choice of weapons, and inasmuch as this is a
hot day, I choose the jawbone."said the major, with a gesture of
impatience.We will
withdraw to that moss-covered rock underneath the trees in there, gather
enough huckleberries and birch bark for our luncheon, and catch a mess
of trout from the brook to go with them, and then we can fight our duel
all the rest of the afternoon.""But how's that going to satisfy my wounded honor?""I'll tell one story," said the sprite, "and you'll tell another, and
when we are through, the one that Jimmieboy says has told the best story
will be the victor.That is better than trying to hurt each other, I
think.""I think so too," put in Jimmieboy."Well, it isn't a bad scheme," agreed the major."Particularly the
luncheon part of it; so you may count on me.I've got a story that will
lift your hair right off your head."So Jimmieboy and his two strange friends retired into the wood, gathered
the huckleberries and birch bark, caught, cooked, and ate the trout, and
then sat down together on the moss-covered rock to fight the duel.The
two fighters drew lots to find out which should tell the first story,
and as the sprite was the winner, he began."When I was not more than a thousand years old--" said the sprite."That was nine thousand years
ago--before this world was made.I celebrated my
ten-thousand-and-sixteenth birthday last Friday--but that has nothing to
do with my story.When I was not more than a thousand years of age, my
parents, who occupied a small star about forty million miles from here,
finding that my father could earn a better living if he were located
nearer the moon, moved away from my birthplace and rented a good-sized,
four-pronged star in the suburbs of the great orb of night.In the old
star we were too far away from the markets for my father to sell the
products of his farm for anything like what they cost him; freight
charges were very heavy, and often the stage-coach that ran between
Twinkleville and the moon would not stop at Twinkleville at all, and
then all the stuff that we had raised that week would get stale, lose
its fizz, and have to be thrown away.""Let me beg your pardon again," put in the major."But what did you
raise on your farm?I never heard of farm products having fizz to lose.""We raised soda-water chiefly," returned the sprite, amiably."Soda-water and suspender buttons.The soda-water was cultivated and the
suspender buttons seemed to grow wild.We never knew exactly how; though
from what I have learned since about them, I think I begin to understand
the science of it; and I wish now that I could find a way to return to
Twinkleville, because I am certain it must be a perfect treasure-house
of suspender buttons by this time.Even in my day they used to lie about
by the million--metallic buttons every one of them.They must be worth
to-day at least a dollar a thousand.""What is your idea about the way they happened to come there, based on
what you have learned since?""Well, it is a very simple idea," returned the sprite."You know when a
suspender button comes off it always disappears.Of course it must go
somewhere, but the question is, where?No one has ever yet been known to
recover the suspender button he has once really lost; and my notion of
it is simply that the minute a metal suspender button comes off the
clothes of anybody in all the whole universe, it immediately flies up
through the air and space to Twinkleville, which is nothing more than a
huge magnet, and lies there until somebody picks it up and tries to sell
it.I remember as a boy sweeping our back yard clear of them one
evening, and waking the next morning to find the whole place covered
with them again; but we never could make money on them, because the moon
was our sole market, and only the best people of the moon ever used
suspenders, and as these were unfortunately relatives of ours, we had to
give them all the buttons they wanted for nothing, so that the button
crops became rather an expense to us than otherwise.But with soda-water
it was different.Everybody, it doesn't make any difference where he
lives, likes soda-water, and it was an especially popular thing in the
moon, where the plain water is always so full of fish that nobody can
drink it.But as I said before, often the stage-coach wouldn't or
couldn't stop, and we found ourselves getting poorer every day.Finally
my father made up his mind to lease, and move into this new star, sink a
half-dozen soda-water wells there, and by means of a patent he owned,
which enabled him to give each well a separate and distinct flavor,
drive everybody else out of the business.""You don't happen to remember how that patent your father owned worked,
do you?"asked the major, noticing that Jimmieboy seemed particularly
interested when the sprite mentioned this."If you do, I'd like to buy
the plan of it from you and give it to Jimmieboy for a Christmas
present, so that he can have soda-water wells in his own back yard at
home.""No, I can't remember anything about it," said the sprite."Nine
thousand years is a long time to remember things of that kind, though I
don't think the scheme was a very hard one to work.For vanilla cream,
it only required a well with plain soda-water in it with a quart of
vanilla beans and three pints of cream poured into it four times a week;
same way with other flavors--a quart of strawberries for strawberry,
sarsaparilla for sarsaparilla, and so forth; but the secret was in the
pouring; there was something in the way papa did the pouring; I never
knew just what it was.But if you don't stop asking questions I'll never finish my story.""You shouldn't make it so interesting if you don't want us to have our
curiosity excited by it," said Jimmieboy."I'd have asked those
questions if the major hadn't."Well, we moved, and in a very short time were comfortably settled in
the suburban star I have mentioned," continued the sprite."As we
expected, my father grew very, very rich.He was referred to in the moon
newspapers as 'The Soda-water King,' and once an article about him said
that he owned the finest suspender-button mine in the universe, which
was more or less true, but which, as it turned out, was unfortunate in
its results.Some moon people hearing of his ownership of the
Twinkleville Button Mines came to him and tried to persuade him that
they ought to be worked.Father said he didn't see any use of it,
because the common people didn't wear suspenders, and so didn't need the
buttons."'True,' said they, 'but we can compel them to need them, by making a
law requiring that everybody over sixteen shall wear suspenders.'"'That's a good idea,' said my father, and he tried to have it made a
law that every one should wear suspenders, high or low, and as a result
he got everybody mad at him.The best people were angry, because up to
that time the wearing of suspenders had been regarded as a sign of noble
birth, and if everybody, including the common people, were to have them
they would cease to be so.The common people themselves were angry,
because to have to buy suspenders would simply be an addition to the
cost of living, and they hadn't any money to spare.In consequence we
were cut off by the best people of the moon.Nobody ever came to see us
except the very commonest kind of common people, and they came at night,
and then only to drop pailfuls of cod-liver oil, squills, ipecac, and
other unpopular things into our soda-water wells, so that in a very
short time my poor father's soda-water business was utterly ruined.People don't like to order ten quarts of vanilla cream soda-water for
Sunday dinner, and find it flavored with cod-liver oil, you know.""Yes, I do know," said Jimmieboy, screwing his face up in an endeavor to
give the major and the sprite some idea of how little he liked the taste
of cod-liver oil."I think cod-liver oil is worse than measles or
mumps, because you can't have measles or mumps more than once, and there
isn't any end to the times you can have cod-liver oil.""I'm with you there," said the major, emphasizing his remark by slapping
Jimmieboy on the back."In fact, sir, on page 29 of my book called
'Musings on Medicines' you will find--if it is ever published--these
lines:

          "The oils of cod!They make me feel tremendous odd,
           Nor hesitate
           I here to state
     I wildly hate the oils of cod.""When I start my autograph album I want you
to write those lines on the first page.""Never, I hope," replied the sprite, with a chuckle."And now suppose
you don't interrupt my story again."Clouds began to gather on the major's face again.The sprite's rebuke
had evidently made him very angry."Sir," said he, as soon as his feelings permitted him to speak."If you
make any more such remarks as that, another duel may be necessary after
this one is fought--which I should very much regret, for duels of this
sort consume a great deal of time, and unless I am much mistaken it will
shortly rain cats and dogs.""It looks that way," said the sprite, "and it is for that very reason
that I do not wish to be interrupted again.Of course ruin stared father
in the face."whispered the major to Jimmieboy, who immediately
silenced him."Trade having fallen away," continued the sprite, "we had to draw upon
our savings for our bread and butter, and finally, when the last penny
was spent, we made up our minds to leave the moon district entirely and
try life on the dog-star, where, we were informed, people only had one
eye apiece, and every man had so much to do that it took all of his one
eye's time looking after his own business so that there wasn't any left
for him to spend on other people's business.It seemed to my father that
in a place like this there was a splendid opening for him.""Renting out his extra eye to blind men," roared the sprite.Jimmieboy fell off the rock with laughter, and the major, angry at being
so neatly caught, rose up and walked away but immediately returned."If this wasn't a duel I wouldn't stay here another minute," he said."But you can't put me to flight that way."The question now came up as to how we should get to the dog-star,"
resumed the sprite."I should think they'd have been so glad you were leaving they'd have
paid your fare," said the major, but the sprite paid no attention."There was no regular stage line between the moon and the dog-star,"
said he, "and we had only two chances of really getting there, and they
were both so slim you could count their ribs.One was by getting aboard
the first comet that was going that way, and the other was by jumping.The trouble with the first chance was that as far as any one knew there
wasn't a comet expected to go in the direction of the dog-star for eight
million years--which was rather a long time for a starving family to
wait, and besides we had read of so many accidents in the moon papers
about people being injured while trying to board comets in motion that
we were a little timid about it.My father and I could have managed
very well; but mother might not have--ladies can't even get on horse
cars in motion without getting hurt, you know.It's a pretty big jump
from the moon to the dog-star, and if you don't aim yourself right you
are apt to miss it, and either fall into space or land somewhere else
where you don't want to go.For instance, a cousin of mine
who lived on Mars wanted to visit us when we lived at Twinkleville, but
he was too mean to pay his fare, thinking he could jump it cheaper.Well, he jumped and where do you suppose he landed?"He didn't come
anywhere near Twinkleville, although he supposed that he was aimed in
the right direction.""Will you tell me how you know he's falling yet?"asked the major, who
didn't seem to believe this part of the sprite's story.I saw him yesterday through a telescope," replied the
sprite."And he looked very tired, too," said the sprite."Though as a matter of
fact he doesn't have to exert himself any.All he has to do is fall,
and, once you get started, falling is the easiest thing in the world.But of course with the remembrance of my cousin's mistake in our minds,
we didn't care so much about making the jump, and we kept putting it off
and putting it off until finally some wretched people had a law made
abolishing us from the moon entirely, which meant that we had to leave
inside of twenty-four hours; so we packed up our trunks with the few
possessions we had left and threw them off toward the dog-star; then
mother and father took hold of hands and jumped and I was to come along
after them with some of the baggage that we hadn't got ready in time."According to my father's instructions I watched him carefully as he
sped through space to see whether he had started right, and to my great
joy I observed that he had--that very shortly both he and mother would
arrive safely on the dog-star--but alas!My joy was soon turned to
grief, for a terrible thing happened.Our great heavy family trunk that
had been dispatched first, and with truest aim, landed on the head of
the King of the dog-star, stove his crown in and nearly killed him.Hardly had the king risen up from the ground when he was again knocked
down by my poor father, who, utterly powerless to slow up or switch
himself to one side, landed precisely as the trunk had landed on the
monarch's head, doing quite as much more damage as the trunk had done in
the beginning.When added to these mishaps a shower of hat-boxes and
hand-bags, marked with our family name, fell upon the Lord Chief
Justice, the Prime Minister and the Heir Apparent, my parents were
arrested and thrown into prison and I decided that the dog-star was no
place for me.Wild with grief, and without looking to see where I was
going, nor in fact caring much, I gave a running leap out into space and
finally through some good fortune landed here on this earth which I have
found quite good enough for me ever since."Here the sprite paused and looked at Jimmieboy as much as to say, "How
is that for a tale of adventure?"cried the major, "Isn't it enough?"I don't see how he could have jumped
so many years before the world was made and yet land on the world.""I was five thousand years on the jump," explained the sprite."It was leap-year when you started, wasn't it?"asked the major, with a
sarcastic smile.asked Jimmieboy,
signaling the major to be quiet.I am afraid they got into serious
trouble.It's a very serious thing to knock a king down with a trunk and
land on his head yourself the minute he gets up again," sighed the
sprite."But didn't you tell me your parents were unfairies?"put in Jimmieboy,
eying the sprite distrustfully."Yes; but they were only my adopted parents," explained the sprite."They were a very rich old couple with lots of money and no children, so
I adopted them not knowing that they were unfairies.When they died they
left me all their bad habits, and their money went to found a storeroom
for worn out lawn-mowers."Well that's a pretty good story," said Jimmieboy."Yes," said the sprite, with a pleased smile."And the best part of it
is it's all true."CHAPTER X.

THE MAJOR'S TALE."A great many years ago when I was a souvenir spoon," said the major, "I
belonged to a very handsome and very powerful potentate.""I didn't quite understand what it was you said you were," said the
sprite, bending forward as if to hear better."At the beginning of my story I was a souvenir spoon," returned the
major."Did you begin your career as a spoon?""I did not, sir," replied the major."I began my career as a nugget in a
lead mine where I was found by the king of whom I have just spoken, and
on his return home with me he gave me to his wife who sent me out to a
lead smith's and had me made over into a souvenir spoon--and a mighty
handsome spoon I was too.I had a poem engraved on me that said:

    'Aka majo te roo li sah,
     Pe mink y rali mis tebah.'Rather pretty thought, don't you think so?"added the major as he
completed the couplet.said the sprite, with a knowing shake of his head."Well, I don't understand it at all," said Jimmieboy."Ask this native of Twinkleville what it means," observed the major with
a snicker."He says it's a pretty thought, so of course he understands
it--though I assure you I don't, for it doesn't mean anything.I made it
up, this very minute."It was quite evident that he had fallen into
the trap the major had set for him."I was only fooling," he said, with a sickly attempt at a smile."I think perhaps the happiest time of my life was during the hundreds of
years that I existed in the royal museum as a spoon," resumed the major."I was brought into use only on state occasions.When the King of
Mangapore gave a state banquet to other kings in the neighborhood I was
the spoon that was used to ladle out the royal broth."Here the major paused to smack his lips, and then a small tear appeared
in one corner of his eye and trickled slowly down the side of his nose."I always weep," he said, as soon as he could speak, "when I think of
that broth.Here is what it was made of:

    'Seven pies of sweetest mince,
     Then a ripe and mellow quince,
         Then a quart of tea.Then a pint of cinnamon,
     Next a roasted apple, done
         Brown as brown can be.Add of orange juice, a gill,
     And a sugared daffodil,
         Then a yellow yam.Sixty-seven strawberries
     Should be added then to these,
         And a pot of jam.Mix with maple syrup and
     Let it in the ice-box stand
         Till it's good and cold--
     Throw a box of raisins in,
     Stir it well--just make it spin--
         Till it looks like gold.'"What a dish it was, and I, I used to be
dipped into a tureen full of it sixteen times at every royal feast,
and before the war we had royal feasts on an average of three times
a day."cried Jimmieboy, his mouth watering to
think of it."Three a day until the unhappy war broke out
which destroyed all my happiness, and resulted in the downfall of
sixty-four kings.""How on earth did such a war as that ever happen to be fought?""I am sorry to say," replied the major, sadly, "that I was the innocent
cause of it all.It was on the king's birthday that war was declared.He
used to have magnificent birthday parties, quite like those that boys
like Jimmieboy here have, only instead of having a cake with a candle in
it for each year, King Fuzzywuz used to have one guest for each year,
and one whole cake for each guest.On his twenty-first birthday he had
twenty-one guests; on his thirtieth, thirty, and so on; and at every one
of these parties I used to be passed around to be admired, I was so very
handsome and valuable."said the sprite, with a sneering laugh."The idea of a lead
spoon being valuable!""If you had ever been able to get into the society of kings," the major
answered, with a great deal of dignity, "you would know that on the
table of a monarch lead is much more rare than silver and gold.It was
this fact that made me so overpoweringly valuable, and it is not
surprising that a great many of the kings who used to come to these
birthday parties should become envious of Fuzzywuz and wish they owned a
treasure like myself.One very old king died of envy because of me, and
his heir-apparent inherited his father's desire to possess me to such a
degree that he too pined away and finally disappeared entirely.Didn't die, you know, as you would, but
vanished."So it went on for years, and finally on his sixty-fourth birthday King
Fuzzywuz gave his usual party, and sixty-four of the choicest kings in
the world were invited.They every one came, the feast was made ready,
and just as the guests took their places around the table, the broth
with me lying at the side of the tureen was brought in.The kings all
took their crowns off in honor of my arrival, when suddenly pouf!a gust
of wind came along and blew out every light in the hall.All was
darkness, and in the midst of it I felt myself grabbed by the handle and
shoved hastily into an entirely strange pocket.'Turn off the wind and bring
a light.'"The slaves hastened to do as they were told, and in less time than it
takes to tell it, light and order were restored.I could see it very plainly through a button-hole in the
cloak of the potentate who had seized me and hidden me in his pocket.Fuzzywuz immediately discovered that I was missing.he roared to the head-waiter,
who, though he was an African of the blackest hue, turned white as a
sheet with fear."'It was in the broth, oh, Nepotic Fuzzywuz, King of the Desert and most
noble Potentate of the Sand Dunes, when I, thy miserable servant,
brought it into the gorgeous banqueting hall and set it here before
thee, who art ever my most Serene and Egotistic Master,' returned the
slave, trembling with fear and throwing himself flat upon the
dining-hall floor.Do
spoons take wings unto themselves and fly away?Are they tadpoles that
they develop legs and hop as frogs from our royal presence?Do spoons
evapidate----'

"'Evaporate, my dear,' suggested the queen in a whisper.'Do spoons evaporate like water in the
sun?Do they raise sails like sloops of war and thunder noiselessly out
of sight?Thou hast stolen it and thou must bear the penalty of
thy predilection----'

"'Dereliction,' whispered the queen, impatiently."'He knows what I mean,' roared the king, 'or if he doesn't he will when
his head is cut off.'""Is that what all those big words meant?""As I remember the occurrence, it is," returned the major."What the
king really meant was always uncertain; he always used such big words
and rarely got them right.Reprehensibility and tremulousness were great
favorites of his, though I don't believe he ever knew what they meant.But, to continue my story, at this point the king rose and sharpening
the carving knife was about to behead the slave's head off when the
potentate who had me in his pocket cried out:

"'Hold, oh Fuzzywuz!I saw the spoon myself at the
side of yon tureen when it was brought hither.'"'Then,' returned the king, 'it has been percolated----'

"'Peculated,' whispered the queen."'That's what I said,' retorted Fuzzywuz, angrily.'The spoon has been
speculated by some one of our royal brethren at this board.The point to
be liquidated now is, who has done this deed.A
guard about the palace gates--and lock the doors and bar the windows.I am sorry to say, that every king in this room
save only myself and my friend Prince Bigaroo, who at the risk of his
kingly dignity deigned to come to the rescue of my slave, must repeal--I
should say reveal--the contents of his pockets.Prince Bigaroo must be
innocent or he would not have ejaculated as he hath.'"You see," said the major, in explanation, "Bigaroo having stolen me was
smart enough to see how it would be if he spoke.A guilty person in nine
cases out of ten would have kept silent and let the slave suffer.So
Bigaroo escaped; but all the others were searched and of course I was
not found.Fuzzywuz was wild with sorrow and anger, and declared that
unless I was returned within ten minutes he would wage war upon, and
utterly destroy, every king in the place.The kings all turned
pale--even Bigaroo's cheek grew white, but having me he was determined
to keep me and so the war began.""Why didn't you speak and save the innocent kings?""Did you ever see a spoon with a
tongue?"He evidently had never seen a spoon with a
tongue."The war was a terrible one," said the major, resuming his story."One
by one the kings were destroyed, and finally only Bigaroo remained, and
Fuzzywuz not having found me in the treasures of the others, finally
came to see that it was Bigaroo who had stolen me.So he turned his
forces toward the wicked monarch, defeated his army, and set fire to his
palace.In that fire I was destroyed as a souvenir spoon and became a
lump of lead once more, lying in the ruins for nearly a thousand years,
when I was sold along with a lot of iron and other things to a junk
dealer.He in turn sold me to a ship-maker, who worked me over into a
sounding lead for a steamer he had built.On my first trip out I was
sent overboard to see how deep the ocean was.I fell in between two
huge rocks down on the ocean's bed and was caught, the rope connecting
me with the ship snapped, and there I was, twenty thousand fathoms under
the sea, lost, as I supposed, forever.The effect of the salt water upon
me was very much like that of hair restorer on some people's heads.I
began to grow a head of green hair--seaweed some people call it--and to
this fact, strangely enough, I owed my escape from the water.A sea-cow
who used to graze about where I lay, thinking that I was only a tuft of
grass gathered me in one afternoon and swallowed me without blinking,
and some time after, the cow having been caught and killed by some giant
fishermen, I was found by the wife of one of the men when the great cow
was about to be cooked.These giants were very strange people who
inhabited an island out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, which was
gradually sinking into the water with the weight of the people on it,
and which has now entirely disappeared.There wasn't one of the
inhabitants that was less than one hundred feet tall, and in those days
they used to act as light-houses for each other at night.They had but
one eye apiece, and when that was open it used to flash just like a
great electric light, and they'd take turns at standing up in the
middle of the island all night long and turning round and round and
round until you'd think they'd drop with dizziness.I staid with these
people, I should say, about forty years, when one morning two of the
giants got disputing as to which of them could throw a stone the
farthest.One of them said he could throw a pebble two thousand miles,
and the other said he could throw one all the way round the world.At
this the first one laughed and jeered, and to prove that he had told the
truth the second grabbed up what he thought was a pebble, but which
happened to be me and threw me from him with all his force."And sad to say I
killed the giant who threw me," returned the major."I went around the
world so swiftly that when I got back to the island the poor fellow
hadn't had time to get out of my way, and as I came whizzing along I
struck him in the back, went right through him, and leaving him dead on
the island went on again and finally fell into a great gun manufactory
in Massachusetts where I was smelted over into a bullet, and sent to the
war.I think I must have
killed off half a dozen regiments of his enemies, and between you and
me, General Washington said I was his favorite bullet, and added that as
long as he had me with him he wasn't afraid of anybody."Here the major paused a minute to smile at the sprite who was beginning
to look a little blue.It was rather plain, the sprite thought, that the
major was getting the best of the duel.How long did you stay with George
Washington?""I'd never have left him if he hadn't
ordered me to do work that I wasn't made for.When a bullet goes to war
he doesn't want to waste himself on ducks.I wanted to go after hostile
generals and majors and cornet players, and if Mr.Washington had used
me for them I'd have hit home every time, but instead of that he took me
off duck shooting one day and actually asked me to knock over a
miserable wild bird he happened to want.He
insisted, and I said,'very well, General, fire away.'He fired, the
duck laughed, and I simply flew off into the woods on the border of the
bay and rested there for nearly a hundred years.The rest of my story
is soon told.I lay where I had fallen until six years ago when I was
picked up by a small boy who used me for a sinker to go fishing with,
after which I found my way into the smelting pot once more, and on the
Fifteenth of November, 1892, I became what I am, Major Blueface, the
handsomest soldier, the bravest warrior, the most talented tin poet that
ever breathed."A long silence followed the completion of the major's story.Which of
the two he liked the better Jimmieboy could not make up his mind, and he
hoped his two companions would be considerate enough not to ask him to
decide between them."I thought they had to be true stories," said the sprite, gloomily."I
don't think it's fair to tell stories like yours--the idea of your being
thrown one and a half times around the world!""It's just as true as yours, anyhow," retorted the major, "but if you
want to begin all over again and tell another I'm ready for you.""We'll leave it to Jimmieboy as it is.""I don't know about that, major," said Jimmieboy."I think you are just
about even."asked the sprite, his face beaming with
pleasure."We'll settle it this way: we'll give five points
to the one who told the best, five points to the one who told the
longest, and five points to the one who told the shortest story.As the
stories are equally good you both get five points for that.The major's
was the longest, I think, so he gets five more, but so does the sprite
because his was the shortest.That makes you both ten, so you both win.""Yes," said the sprite, squeezing Jimmieboy's hand affectionately, "and
so do I."Which after all, I think, was the best way to decide a duel of that
sort."Well, now that that is settled," said the major with a sigh of relief,
"I suppose we had better start off and see whether Fortyforefoot will
attend to this business of getting the provisions for us.""The major is right there, Jimmieboy.You have
delayed so long on the way that it is about time you did something, and
the only way I know of for you to do it is by getting hold of
Fortyforefoot.If you wanted an apple pie and there was nothing in sight
but a cart-wheel he would change it into an apple pie for you.""That's all very well," replied Jimmieboy, "but I'm not going to call on
any giant who'd want to eat me.You might just as well understand that
right off.I'll try on your invisible coat and if that makes me
invisible I'll go.If it doesn't we'll have to try some other plan.""That is the prudent thing to do," said the major, nodding his approval
to the little general."As my poem tries to teach, it is always wise to
use your eyes--or look before you leap.The way it goes is this:

    'If you are asked to make a jump,
     Be careful lest you prove a gump--
         Awake or e'en in sleep--
     Don't hesitate the slightest bit
     To show that you've at least the wit
         To look before you leap.Why, in a dream one night, I thought
     A fellow told me that I ought
         To jump to Labrador.I did not look but blindly hopped,
     And where do you suppose I stopped?I do not say, had I been wise
     Enough that time to use my eyes--
         As I've already said--
     To Labrador I would have got:
     But this _is_ certain, I would not
         Have tumbled out of bed.'"The moral of which is, be careful how you go into things, and if you
are not certain that you are coming out all right don't go into them,"
added the major."Why, when I was a mouse----"

"Oh, come, major--you couldn't have been a mouse," interrupted the
sprite."You've just told us all about what you've been in the past, and
you couldn't have been all that and a mouse too.""So I have," said the major, with a smile."I'd forgotten that, and you
are right, too.I should have put what I
was going to say differently.If I had ever been a mouse--that's the way
it should be--if I had ever been a mouse and had been foolish enough to
stick my head into a mouse-trap after a piece of cheese without knowing
that I should get it out again, I should not have been here to-day, in
all likelihood.Try on the invisible
coat, Jimmieboy, and let's see how it works before you risk calling on
Fortyforefoot.""Here it is," said the sprite, holding out his hands with apparently
nothing in them.Jimmieboy laughed a little, it seemed so odd to have a person say "here
it is" and yet not be able to see the object referred to.He reached out
his hand, however, to take the coat, relying upon the sprite's statement
that it was there, and was very much surprised to find that his hand did
actually touch something that felt like a coat, and in fact was a coat,
though entirely invisible."Shall I help you on with it?""Perhaps you'd better," said Jimmieboy."It feels a little small for
me.""That's what I was afraid of," said the sprite."You see it covers me
all over from head to foot--that is the coat covers all but my head and
the hood covers that--but you are very much taller than I am."Here Jimmieboy, having at last got into the coat and buttoned it about
him, had the strange sensation of seeing all of himself disappear
excepting his head and legs.These remaining uncovered were of course
still in sight.laughed the major, merrily, as Jimmieboy walked around."That is the most ridiculous thing I ever saw.You're nothing but a head
and pair of legs."Jimmieboy smiled and placed the hood over his head and the major roared
louder than ever.That's funnier still--now
you're nothing but a pair of legs.Take it off quick or
I'll die with laughter.""I'm afraid it won't do, Spritey," he said."Fortyforefoot would see my
legs and if he caught them I'd be lost.""That's a fact," said the sprite, thoughtfully."The coat is almost two
feet too short for you.""It's more than two feet too short," laughed the major."It's two whole
legs too short.""This is no time for joking," said the sprite."We've too much to talk
about to use our mouths for laughing.""I won't get off any more, or if I do they
won't be the kind to make you laugh.But I say, boys," he added, "I have a scheme.It is of course the scheme
of a soldier and may be attended by danger, but if it is successful all
the more credit to the one who succeeds.We three people can attack
Fortyforefoot openly, capture him, and not let him go until he provides
us with the provisions.""That sounds lovely," sneered the sprite."But I'd like to know some of
the details of this scheme.It is easy enough to say attack him, capture
him and not let him go, but the question is, how shall we do all this?""It ought to be easy," returned the major."There are only three things
to be done.A kitten can attack an elephant if it wants to.The second is to capture
him, which, while it seems hard, is not really so if the attack is
properly made."Clear as a fog," put in the sprite."Now there are three of us--Jimmieboy, Spriteyboy and Yourstrulyboy,"
continued the major, "so what could be more natural than that we should
divide up these three operations among us?Therefore I propose
that Jimmieboy here shall attack Fortyforefoot; the sprite shall capture
him and throw him into a dungeon cell and I will crown the work by not
letting him go.""Jimmieboy and I take all the danger I
notice.""I am utterly unselfish about
it.I am willing to put myself in the background and let you have all
the danger and most of the glory.I only come in at the very end--but I
don't mind that.I have had glory enough for ten life-times, so why
should I grudge you this one little bit of it?My feelings in regard to
glory will be found on the fortieth page of Leaden Lyrics or the Ballads
of Ben Bullet--otherwise myself.The verses read as follows:

    'Though glory, it must be confessed,
       Is satisfying stuff,
     Upon my laurels let me rest
       For I have had enough.Ne'er was a glorier man than I,
       Ne'er shall a glorier be,
     Than, trembling reader, you'll espy--
       When haply you spy me.So bring no more--for while 'tis good
       To have, 'tis also plain
     A bit of added glory would
       Be apt to make me vain.'And I don't want to be vain," concluded the major."Well, I don't want any of your glory," said the sprite, "and if I know
Jimmieboy I don't think he does either.If you want to reverse your
order of things and do the dangerous part of the work yourself, we will
do all in our power to make your last hours comfortable, and I will see
to it that the newspapers tell how bravely you died, but we can't go
into the scheme any other way.""You talk as if you were the general's prime minister, or his nurse,"
retorted the major, "whereas in reality I, being his chief of staff, am
they if anybody are."Here the major blushed a little because he was not quite sure of his
grammar.Neither of his companions seemed to notice the mixture,
however, and so he continued:

"General, it is for you to say.Shall my plan go or shall she stay?""Well, I think myself, major, that it is a little too dangerous for me,
and if any other plan could be made I'd like it better," answered
Jimmieboy, anxious to soothe the major's feelings which were evidently
getting hurt again."Suppose I go back and order the soldiers to attack
Fortyforefoot and bring him in chains to me?""Couldn't be done," said the sprite."The minute the chains were clapped
on him he would change them into doughnuts and eat them all up.""Yes," put in the major, "and the chances are he would turn the soldiers
into a lot of toy balloons on a string and then cut the string.""He couldn't do that," said the sprite, "because he can't turn people or
animals into anything."Well, I think the best thing to do would be for me to change myself
into a giant bigger than he is," said the sprite."Then I could put you
and the major in my pockets and call upon Fortyforefoot and ask him, in
a polite way, to turn some pebbles and sticks and other articles into
the things we want, and, if he won't do it except he is paid, we'll pay
him if we can.""What do you propose to pay him with?""I suppose
you'll hand him half a dozen checkerberries and tell him if he'll turn
them into ten one dollar bills he'll have ten dollars."You can't tempt Fortyforefoot with
money.It is only by offering him something to eat that we can hope to
get his assistance."And you'll request him to turn a handful of pine cones into a dozen
turkeys on toast, I presume?"I shall simply offer to let him have
you for dinner--you will serve up well in croquettes--Blueface
croquettes--eh, Jimmieboy?"The poor major turned white with fear and rage.At first he felt
inclined to slay the sprite on the spot, and then it suddenly flashed
across his mind that before he could do it the sprite might really turn
himself into a giant and do with him as he had said.So he contented
himself with turning pale and giving a sickly smile."That would be a good joke on me," he said.Sprite, I don't think I would enjoy it, and after all I have a sort of
notion that I would disagree with Fortyforefoot--which would be
extremely unfortunate.I know I should rest like lead on his
digestion--and that would make him angry with you and I should be
sacrificed for nothing.""Well, I wouldn't consent to that anyhow," said Jimmieboy."I love the
major too much to----"

"So do we all," interrupted the sprite."Why even I love the major and I
wouldn't let anybody eat him for anything--no, sir!--not if I were
offered a whole vanilla eclaire would I permit the major to be eaten.I will turn myself into a giant
twice as big as Fortyforefoot; I will place you and the major in my
pockets and then I will call upon him.He will be so afraid of me that
he will do almost anything I ask him to, but to make him give us the
very best things he can make I would rather deal gently with him, and
instead of forcing him to make the peaches and cherries I'll offer to
trade you two fellows off for the things we need.He will be pleased
enough at the chance to get anything so good to eat as you look, and
he'll prepare everything for us, and he will put you down stairs in the
pantry.Then I will tell him stories, and some of the major's jokes, to
make him sleepy, and when finally he dozes off I will steal the pantry
key and set you free."It's a very good plan unless Fortyforefoot should find us so toothsome
looking that he would want to eat us raw.We may be nothing more than
fruit for him, you know, and truly I don't want to be anybody's apple,"
said Jimmieboy."You are quite correct there, general," said the major, with a chuckle."In fact, I'm quite sure he'd think you and I were fruit because being
two we are necessarily a pear.""It won't happen," said the sprite."He isn't likely to think you are
fruit and even if he does I won't let him eat you.I'll keep him from
doing it if I have to eat you myself.""Oh, of course, then, with a kind promise like that there is nothing
left for us to do but accept your proposition," said the
major."As Ben Bullet says:

    'When only one thing can be done--
       If people only knew it--
     The wisest course beneath the sun
       Is just to go and do it.'""I'm willing to take my chances," said Jimmieboy, "if after I see what
kind of a giant you can turn yourself into I think you are terrible
enough to frighten another giant.""Well, just watch me," said the sprite, taking off his coat."And mind,
however terrifying I may become, don't you get frightened, because I
won't hurt you.""Go ahead," said the major, valiantly."Wait until we get scared before
talking like that to us."'Bazam, bazam,
     A sprite I am,
     Bazoo, bazee,
     A giant I'd be.'"Then there came a terrific noise; the trees about the little group shook
to the very last end of their roots, all grew dark as night, and as
quickly grew light again.In the returning light Jimmieboy saw looming
up before him a fearful creature, eighty feet high, clad in a
magnificent suit embroidered with gold and silver, a fierce mustache
upon his lip, and dangling at his side was a heavy sword.It was the sprite now transformed into a giant--a terrible-looking
fellow, though to Jimmieboy he was not terrible because the boy knew
that the dreadful creature was only his little friend in disguise.came a bellowing voice from above the trees.I'm sure you'll do, and I am ready,"
said Jimmieboy, with a laugh.But there came no answer, and Jimmieboy, looking about him to see why
the major made no reply, was just in time to see that worthy soldier's
coat-tails disappearing down the road.The major was running away as fast as he could go."You've frightened him pretty well, Spritey," said Jimmieboy, with a
laugh, as the major passed out of sight."But you don't seem a bit afraid.""I'm not--though I think I should be if I didn't know who you are,"
returned Jimmieboy."Well, I need to be if I am to get the best of Fortyforefoot, but, I
say, you mustn't call me Spritey now that I am a giant.It won't do to
call me by any name that would show Fortyforefoot who I really am," said
the sprite, with a warning shake of his head."Bludgeonhead is my name now," replied the sprite."Benjamin B.
Bludgeonhead is my full name, but you know me well enough to call me
plain Bludgeonhead.""All right, plain Bludgeonhead," said Jimmieboy, "I'll do as you
say--and now don't you think we'd better be starting along?""Yes," said Bludgeonhead, reaching down and grabbing hold of Jimmieboy
with his huge hand."We'll start right away, and until we come in sight
of Fortyforefoot's house I think perhaps you'll be more comfortable if
you ride on my shoulder instead of in my coat-pocket.""Thank you very much," said Jimmieboy, as Bludgeonhead lifted him up
from the ground and set him lightly as a feather on his shoulder."I think I'd like to be
as tall as this all the time, Bludgeonhead.What a great thing it would
be on parade days to be as tall as this.Why I can see miles and miles
of country from here.""Yes, it's pretty fine--but I don't think I'd care to be so tall
always," returned Bludgeonhead, as he stepped over a great broad river
that lay in his path."It makes one very uppish to be as high in the air
as this; and you'd be all the time looking down on your friends, too,
which would be so unpleasant for your friends that they wouldn't have
anything to do with you after a while.I'm going to
jump over this mountain in front of us."Here Bludgeonhead drew back a little and then took a short run, after
which he leaped high in the air, and he and Jimmieboy sailed easily over
the great hills before them, and then alighted safe and sound on the
other side.cried Jimmieboy, clapping his hands with glee."I hope there are lots more hills like that to be jumped over.""No, there aren't," said Bludgeonhead, "but if you like it so much I'll
go back and do it again."Bludgeonhead turned back and jumped over the mountain half a dozen times
until Jimmieboy was satisfied and then he resumed his journey."This," he said, after trudging along in silence for some time, "this is
Fortyforefoot Valley, and in a short time we shall come to the giant's
castle; but meanwhile I want you to see what a wonderful place this is.The valley itself will give you a better idea of Fortyforefoot's great
power as a magician than anything else that I know of.Do you know what
this place was before he came here?""It was a great big hole in the ground," returned Bludgeonhead.Fortyforefoot liked the situation because it was
surrounded by mountains and nobody ever wanted to come here because sand
pits aren't worth visiting.There wasn't a tree or a speck of a green
thing anywhere in sight--nothing but yellow sand glaring in the sun all
day and sulking in the moon all night."It's all covered with beautiful trees and
gardens and brooks now," said Jimmieboy, which was quite true, for the
Fortyforefoot Valley was a perfect paradise to look at, filled with
everything that was beautiful in the way of birds and trees and flowers
and water courses."How could he make the trees and flowers grow in dry
hot sand like that?""By his magic power, of course," answered Bludgeonhead."He filled up a
good part of the sand pit with stones that he found about here, and then
he changed one part of the desert into a pond so that he could get all
the water he wanted.Then he took a square mile of sand and changed
every grain of it into blades of grass.Other portions he transformed
into forests until finally simply by the wonderful power he has to
change one thing into another he got the place into its present shape.""But the birds, how did he make them?""He didn't," said Bludgeonhead.They saw
what a beautiful place this was and they simply moved in."Bludgeonhead paused a moment in his walk and set Jimmieboy down on the
ground again."I think I'll take a rest here before going on.We are very near to
Fortyforefoot's castle now," he said."I'll sit down here for a few
moments and sharpen my sword and get in good shape for a fight if one
becomes necessary.This place is full of
traps for just such fellows as you who come in here.That's the way
Fortyforefoot catches them for dinner."So Jimmieboy staid close by Bludgeonhead's side and was very much
entertained by all that went on around him.He saw the most wonderful
birds imaginable, and great bumble-bees buzzed about in the flowers
gathering honey by the quart.Once a great jack-rabbit, three times as
large as he was, came rushing out of the woods toward him, and Jimmieboy
on stooping to pick up a stone to throw at Mr.Bunny to frighten him
away, found that all the stones in that enchanted valley were precious.He couldn't help laughing outright when he discovered that the stone he
had thrown at the rabbit was a huge diamond as big as his fist, and that
even had he stopped to choose a less expensive missile he would have had
to confine his choice to pearls, rubies, emeralds, and other gems of the
rarest sort.And then he noticed that what he thought was a rock upon
which he and Bludgeonhead were sitting was a massive nugget of pure
yellow gold.This lead him on to inspect the trees about him and then he
discovered a most absurd thing.Fortyforefoot's extravagance had
prompted him to make all his pine trees of the most beautifully polished
and richly inlaid mahogany; every one of the weeping willows was made of
solid oak, ornamented and carved until the eye wearied of its beauty,
and as for the birds in the trees, their nests were made not of stray
wisps of straw and hay stolen from the barns and fields, but of the
softest silk, rich in color and lined throughout with eiderdown, the
mere sight of which could hardly help being restful to a tired bird--or
boy either, for that matter, Jimmieboy thought."Did he make all this out of sand?All these jewels and magnificent
carvings?""Simply took up a handful of sand and tossed
it up in the air and whatever he commanded it to be it became.But the
most wonderful thing in this place is his spring.He made what you might
call a 'Wish Dipper' out of an old tin cup.Then he dug a hole and
filled it with sand which he commanded to become liquid, and, when the
sand heard him say that, it turned to liquid, but the singular thing
about it is that as Fortyforefoot didn't say what kind of liquid it
should be, it became any kind.So now if any one is thirsty and wants a
glass of cider all he has to do is to dip the wish dipper into the
spring and up comes cider.If he wants lemonade up comes lemonade.If he
wants milk up comes milk.As Bludgeonhead spoke these words Jimmieboy was startled to hear
something very much like an approaching footstep far down the road.he asked, seizing Bludgeonhead by the hand."Yes, I did," replied Bludgeonhead, in a whisper."It sounded to me like
Fortyforefoot's step, too.""I'd better hide, hadn't I?"Climb inside
my coat and snuggle down out of sight in my pocket.We musn't let him
see you yet awhile."Jimmieboy did as he was commanded, and found the pocket a very
comfortable place, only it was a little stuffy."It's pretty hot in here," he whispered."Well, look up on the left hand corner of the outer side of the pocket
and you'll find two flaps that are buttoned up," replied Bludgeonhead,
softly.One will let in all the air you want, and the
other will enable you to peep out and see Fortyforefoot without his
seeing you."In a minute the buttons were found and the flaps opened.Everything
happened as Bludgeonhead said it would, and in a minute Jimmieboy,
peering out through the hole in the cloak, saw Fortyforefoot
approaching.The owner of the beautiful valley seemed very angry when he caught sight
of Bludgeonhead sitting on his property, and hastening up to him, he
cried:

"What business have you here in the Valley of Fortyforefoot?"Jimmieboy shrank back into one corner of the pocket, a little overcome
with fear.Fortyforefoot was larger and more terrible than he thought."I am not good at riddles," said Bludgeonhead, calmly."That is at
riddles of that sort.If you had asked me the difference between a duck
and a garden rake I should have told you that a duck has no teeth and
can eat, while a rake has plenty of teeth and can't eat.But when you
ask me what business I have here I am forced to say that I can't say.""You are a very bright sort of a giant," sneered Fortyforefoot."The fact is I can't help being bright.My
mother polishes me every morning with a damp chamois.""Do you know to whom you are speaking?"asked Fortyforefoot,
threateningly."No; not having been introduced to you, I can't say I know you,"
returned Bludgeonhead.You are Anklehigh, the
Dwarf."At this Fortyforefoot turned purple with rage."I'll right quickly teach thee a
lesson thou rash fellow."Fortyforefoot strode up close to Bludgeonhead, whose size he could not
have guessed because Bludgeonhead had been sitting down all this time
and was pretty well covered over by his cloak.[Illustration: BLUDGEONHEAD SHOWS JIMMIEBOY TO FORTYFOREFOOT.[Blank Page]

"I'll take thee by thine ear and toss thee to the moon," he cried,
reaching out his hand to make good his word."Nonsense, Anklehigh," returned Bludgeonhead, calmly.No dwarf can fight with a giant of my size.""But I am not the dwarf Anklehigh," shrieked Fortyforefoot."And I am Bludgeonhead," returned the other, rising and towering way
above the owner of the valley.cried Fortyforefoot, falling on his knees in abject
terror.Pardon, O, Bludgeonhead.I did not know
you when I was so hasty as to offer to throw you to the moon.I thought
you were--er--that you were--er----"

"More easily thrown," suggested Bludgeonhead."Yes--yes--that was it," stammered Fortyforefoot."And now, to show that
you have forgiven me, I want you to come to my castle and have dinner
with me.""I'll be very glad to," replied Bludgeonhead."What are you going to
have for dinner?""Anything you wish," said Fortyforefoot."I was going to have a very
plain dinner to-night because for to-morrow's dinner I have invited my
brother Fortythreefoot and his wife Fortytwoinch to have a little
special dish I have been so fortunate as to secure.""Oh, only a sniveling creature I caught in one of my traps this
afternoon.He was a soldier, and he wasn't very brave about being
caught, but I judge from looking at him that he will make good eating,"
said Fortyforefoot."I couldn't gather from him who he was.He had on a
military uniform, but he behaved less like a warrior than ever I
supposed a man could.It seems from his story that he was engaged upon
some secret mission, and on his way back to his army, he stumbled over
and into one of my game traps where I found him.He begged me to let him
go, but that was out of the question.I haven't had a soldier to eat for
four years, so I took him to the castle, had him locked up in the
ice-box, and to-morrow we shall eat him."asked Bludgeonhead, thoughtfully.He told me so many names that I didn't
believe he really owned any of them," said Fortyforefoot."All I could
really learn about him was that he was as brave as a lion, and that if I
would spare him he would write me a poem a mile long every day of my
life.""Very attractive offer, that," said Bludgeonhead, with a smile."Yes; but I couldn't do it.I wouldn't miss eating him for anything,"
replied Fortyforefoot, smacking his lips, hungrily."I'd give anything
anybody'd ask, too, if I could find another as good.""Well, now, I thought you
would, and that is really what I have come here for.I have in my pocket
here a real live general that I have captured.Now between you and me, I
don't eat generals.I don't care for them--they fight so.I prefer
preserved cherries and pickled peaches and--er--strawberry jam and
powdered sugar and almonds, and other things like that, you know, and it
occurred to me that if I let you have the general you would supply me
with what I needed of the others.""You have come to the right place, Bludgeonhead," said Fortyforefoot,
eagerly."I'll give you a million cans of jam, all the pickled peaches
and other things you can carry if this general you speak about is a fine
specimen.""Well, here he is," said Bludgeonhead, hauling Jimmieboy out of his
pocket--whispering to Jimmieboy at the same time not to be afraid
because he wouldn't let anything happen to him, and so of course
Jimmieboy felt perfectly safe, though a little excited."No," answered Bludgeonhead, putting Jimmieboy back into his pocket
again."If I ever do find another, though, you shall have him."This of course put Fortyforefoot in a tremendously good humor, and
before an hour had passed he had not only transformed pebbles and twigs
and leaves of trees and other small things into the provisions that the
tin soldiers needed, but he had also furnished horses and wagons enough
to carry them back to headquarters, and then Fortyforefoot accompanied
by Bludgeonhead entered the castle, where the proprietor demanded that
Jimmieboy should be given up to him.Bludgeonhead handed him over at once, and ten minutes later Jimmieboy
found himself locked up in the pantry.Hardly had he time to think over the strange events of the afternoon
when he heard a noise in the ice-box over in one corner of the pantry,
and on going there to see what was the cause of it he heard a familiar
voice repeating over and over again these mournful lines:

    "From Giant number one I ran--
       But O the sequel dire!I truly left a frying-pan
       And jumped into a fire.""Hullo in there," whispered Jimmieboy."The bravest man of my time," replied the voice in the ice-box."Major
Mortimer Carraway Blueface of the 'Jimmieboy Guards.'""Oh, I am so glad to find you again," cried Jimmieboy, throwing open the
ice-box door."I thought it was you the minute I heard your poetry.""You recognized the beauty of
the poem?""But you said you were in the fire when I
knew you were in the ice-box, and so of course----"

"Of course," said the major, with a frown."You remembered that when I
say one thing I mean another.Well, I'm glad to see you again, but why
did you desert me so cruelly?"For a moment Jimmieboy could say nothing, so surprised was he at the
major's question.Then he simply repeated it, his amazement very evident
in the tone of his voice."Why did we desert you so cruelly?"When two of my companions
in arms leave me, the way you and old Spriteyboy did, I think you ought
to make some explanation."But we didn't desert you," said Jimmieboy."No such idea ever entered
our minds.The minute Spritey turned into
Bludgeonhead you ran away just about as fast as your tin legs could
carry you--frightened to death evidently.""Jimmieboy," said the major, his voice husky with emotion, "any other
person than yourself would have had to fight a duel with me for casting
such a doubt as you have just cast upon my courage.The idea of me, of
I, of myself, Major Mortimer Carraway Blueface, the hero of a hundred
and eighty-seven real sham fights, the most poetic as well as the
handsomest man in the 'Jimmieboy Guards' being accused of running away!"I've been accused of dreadful things,
     Of wearing copper finger-rings,
     Of eating green peas with a spoon,
     Of wishing that I owned the moon,
     Of telling things that weren't the truth,
     Of having cut no wisdom tooth,
     In times of war of stealing buns,
     And fainting at the sound of guns,
     Yet never dreamed I'd see the day
     When it was thought I'd run away.Alack--O--well-a-day--alas!Alas--O--well-a-day--alack!Alas--alack--O--well-a-day!Aday--alas--O--lack-a-well--"

"Are you going to keep that up forever?""If you are
I'm going to get out.I've heard stupid poetry in this campaign, but
that's the worst yet.""I only wanted to show you what I could do in the way of a lamentation,"
said the major."If you've had enough I'll stop of course; but tell me,"
he added, sitting down upon a cake of ice, and crossing his legs, "how
on earth did you ever get hold of the ridiculous notion that I ran away
frightened?"The minute
the sprite was changed into Bludgeonhead I turned to speak to you, and
all I could see of you was your coat-tails disappearing around the
corner way down the road.""And just because my coat-tails behaved like that you put me down as a
coward?"I hurried
off; but not because I was afraid.I was simply going down the road to
see if I couldn't find a looking-glass so that Spriteyboy could see how
he looked as a giant.""That's a magnificent excuse," he said."I thought you'd think it was," said the major, with a pleased smile."And when I finally found that there weren't any mirrors to be had
along the road I went back, and you two had gone and left me."It's a great thing, sleep is, and I wrote the
lines off in two tenths of a fifth of a second.As I remember it, this
is the way they went:

    "SLEEP.Deserted by my friends I sit,
       And silently I weep,
     Until I'm wearied so by it,
     I lose my little store of wit;
       I nod and fall asleep.Then in my dreams my friends I spy--
       Once more are they my own.I cease to murmur and to cry,
     For then 'tis sure to be that I
       Forget I am alone.'Tis hence I think that sleep's the best
       Of friends that man has got--
      Not only does it bring him rest
     But makes him feel that he is blest
       With blessings he has not.""Why didn't you go to sleep if you felt that way?""I wanted to find you and I hadn't time.There was only time for me to
scratch that poem off on my mind and start to find you and Bludgeyboy,"
replied the major."His name isn't Bludgeyboy," said Jimmieboy, with a smile."Oh, yes, I forgot," said the major."It's a good name, too,
Bludgeonpate is.""How did you come to be captured by Fortyforefoot?"asked Jimmieboy,
after he had decided not to try to correct the major any more as to
Bludgeonhead's name."The idea of a miserable
ogre like Fortyforefoot capturing me, the most sagacitacious soldier of
modern times.I suppose you think I fell into one of his game traps?""That's what he said," said Jimmieboy."He said you acted in a very
curious way, too--promised him all sorts of things if he'd let you go.""That's just like those big, bragging giants," said the major.I came here of my own free will
and accord."Down here into this pantry and into the ice-chest?You can't fool me," said Jimmieboy."To meet you, of course," retorted the major.I knew it
was part of your scheme to come here.You and I were to be put into the
pantry and then old Bludgeyhat was to come and rescue us.I was the one
to make the scheme, wasn't I?"It was Bludgeonhead," said Jimmieboy, who didn't know whether to
believe the major or not."That's just the way," said the major, indignantly, "he gets all the
credit just because he's big and I don't get any, and yet if you knew of
all the wild animals I've killed to get here to you, how I met
Fortyforefoot and bound him hand and foot and refused to let him go
unless he would permit me to spend a week in his ice-chest, for the sole
and only purpose that I wished to meet you again, you'd change your mind
mighty quick about me.""Did you ever see me in a real sham battle?""No, I never did," said Jimmieboy."Well, you'd better never," returned the major, "unless you want to be
frightened out of your wits.I have been called the living telescope,
sir, because when I begin to fight, in the fiercest manner possible, I
sort of lengthen out and sprout up into the air until I am taller than
any foe within my reach."queried Jimmieboy, with a puzzled air about him."Well, I should like to see it once," said Jimmieboy."Then you will never believe it," returned the major, "because you will
never see it.I never fight in the presence of others, sir."As the major spoke these words a heavy footstep was heard on the stairs.cried the major, springing to his feet."I do not ask you for your gold,
       Nor for an old straw hat--
     I simply ask that I be told
       Oh what, oh what is that?""It is a footstep on the stairs," said Jimmieboy.moaned the major "If it is Fortyforefoot all is
over for us."I was afraid he could not wait,
       The miserable sinner,
     To serve me up in proper state
       At his to-morrow's dinner.Alas, he comes I greatly fear
       In search of Major Me, sir,
     And that he'll wash me down with beer
       This very night at tea, sir.""Oh, why did I come here--why----"

"I shall!"roared a voice out in the passage-way."You shall not," roared another voice, which Jimmieboy was delighted to
recognize as Bludgeonhead's."I am hungry," said the first voice, "and what is mine is my own to do
with as I please."I will toss you into the air, my dear Fortyforefoot," returned
Bludgeonhead's voice, "if you advance another step; and with such force,
sir, that you will never come down again."Stand aside," roared the voice of
Fortyforefoot.The two prisoners in the pantry heard a tremendous scuffling, a crash,
and a loud laugh.Then Bludgeonhead's voice was heard again."Good-by, Fortyforefoot," it cried."I hope he is not going to leave us," whispered Jimmieboy, but the major
was too frightened to speak, and he trembled so that half a dozen times
he fell off the ice-cake that he had been sitting on."Give my love to the moon when you pass her, and when you get up into
the milky way turn half a million of the stars there into baked apples
and throw 'em down to me," called Bludgeonhead's voice."If you'll only lasso me and pull me back I'll do anything you want me
to," came the voice of Fortyforefoot from some tremendous height, it
seemed to Jimmieboy."Not if I know it," replied Bludgeonhead, with a laugh."I think I'd
like to settle down here myself as the owner of Fortyforefoot Valley.Whatever answer was made to this it was too indistinct for Jimmieboy to
hear, and in a minute the key of the pantry door was turned, the door
thrown open, and Bludgeonhead stood before them."You are free," he said, grasping Jimmieboy's hand and squeezing it
affectionately."But I had to get rid of him.It was the only way to do
it."And did you really throw him off into the air?"asked Jimmieboy, as he
walked out into the hall.ejaculated Jimmieboy, as he glanced upward and saw a huge rent in
the ceiling, through which, gradually rising and getting smaller and
smaller the further he rose, was to be seen the unfortunate
Fortyforefoot."I simply picked him up and tossed him over
my head.I shall turn myself into Fortyforefoot
and settle down here forever, only instead of being a bad giant I shall
be a good one--but hallo!The major had crawled out of the ice-chest and was now trying to appear
calm, although his terrible fright still left him trembling so that he
could hardly speak."It is Major Blueface," said Jimmieboy, with a smile."He was Fortyforefoot's other prisoner.""N--nun--not at--t--at--at all," stammered the major."I
def--fuf--feated him in sus--single combat.""But what are you trembling so for now?""I--I am--m not tut--trembling," retorted the major."I--I am o--only
sh--shivering with--th--the--c--c--c--cold.I--I--I've bub--been in
th--that i--i--i--ice bu--box sus--so long."Jimmieboy and Bludgeonhead roared with laughter at this.Then giving the
major a warm coat to put on they sent him up stairs to lie down and
recover his nerves.After the major had been attended to, Bludgeonhead changed himself back
into the sprite again, and he and Jimmieboy sauntered in and out among
the gardens for an hour or more and were about returning to the castle
for supper when they heard sounds of music.There was evidently a brass
band coming up the road.In an instant they hid themselves behind a
tree, from which place of concealment they were delighted two or three
minutes later to perceive that the band was none other than that of the
"Jimmieboy Guards," and that behind it, in splendid military form,
appeared Colonel Zinc followed by the tin soldiers themselves.cried Jimmieboy, throwing his cap into the air.shrieked the colonel, waving his sword with delight, and
commanding his regiment to halt, as he caught sight of Jimmieboy.[Illustration: BLUDGEONHEAD COMES TO THE RESCUE.[Blank Page]

"Us likewise!"cheered the soldiers: following which came a trembling
voice from one of the castle windows which said:

    "I also wish to add my cheer
       Upon this happy day;
     And if you'll kindly come up here
       You'll hear me cry 'Hooray.'""No," said the sprite, motioning to Jimmieboy not to betray the major."Only a little worn-out by the fight we have had with Fortyforefoot.""Yes," said the sprite, modestly."We three have got rid of him at
last.""Do you know who
Fortyforefoot really was?"asked Jimmieboy, his curiosity aroused."The Parallelopipedon himself," said the colonel."We found that out
last night, and fearing that he might have captured our general and our
major we came here to besiege him in his castle and rescue our
officers.""But I don't see how Fortyforefoot could have been the
Parallelopipedon," said Jimmieboy."What would he want to be him for,
when, all he had to do to get anything he wanted was to take sand and
turn it into it?""Ah, but don't you see," explained the colonel, "there was one thing he
never could do as Fortyforefoot.The law prevented him from leaving this
valley here in any other form than that of the Parallelopipedon.He
didn't mind his confinement to the valley very much at first, but after
a while he began to feel cooped up here, and then he took an old packing
box and made it look as much like a living Parallelopipedon as he could.Then he got into it whenever he wanted to roam about the world.Probably
if you will search the castle you will find the cast-off shell he used
to wear, and if you do I hope you will destroy it, because it is said to
be a most horrible spectacle--frightening animals to death and causing
every flower within a mile to wither and shrink up at the mere sight of
it.""It's all true, Jimmieboy," said the sprite.Why,
he only gave us those cherries and peaches there in exchange for
yourself because he expected to get them all back again, you know.""It was a glorious victory," said the colonel."I will now announce it
to the soldiers."This he did and the soldiers were wild with joy when they heard the
news, and the band played a hymn of victory in which the soldiers
joined, singing so vigorously that they nearly cracked their voices.When they had quite finished the colonel said he guessed it was time to
return to the barracks in the nursery."Not before the feast," said the sprite."We have here all the
provisions the general set out to get, and before you return home,
colonel, you and your men should divide them among you."So the table was spread and all went happily.In the midst of the feast
the major appeared, determination written upon every line of his face.The soldiers cheered him loudly as he walked down the length of the
table, which he acknowledged as gracefully as he could with a stiff bow,
and then he spoke:

"Gentlemen," he said, "I have always been a good deal of a favorite with
you, and I know that what I am about to do will fill you with deep
grief.I am going to stop being a man of war.The tremendous victory we
have won to-day is the result entirely of the efforts of myself, General
Jimmieboy and Major Sprite--for to the latter I now give the title I
have borne so honorably for so many years.Our present victory is one of
such brilliantly brilliant brilliance that I feel that I may now retire
with lustre enough attached to my name to last for millions and millions
of years.I need rest, and here I shall take it, in this beautiful
valley, which by virtue of our victory belongs wholly and in equal parts
to General Jimmieboy, Major Sprite and myself.Hereafter I shall be
known only as Mortimer Carraway Blueface, Poet Laureate of Fortyforefoot
Hall, Fortyforefoot Valley, Pictureland.As Governor-General of the
country we have decided to appoint our illustrious friend, Major
Benjamin Bludgeonhead Sprite.General Jimmieboy will remain commander of
the forces, and the rest of you may divide amongst yourselves, as a
reward for your gallant services, all the provisions that may now be
left upon this table.That
is that you do not take the table.It is of solid mahogany and must be
worth a very considerable sum.Now let the saddest word be said,
    Now bend in sorrow deep the head.Let tears flow forth and drench the dell:
    Farewell, brave soldier boys, farewell."Here the major wiped his eyes sadly and sat down by the sprite who shook
his hand kindly and thanked him for giving him his title of major."We'll have fine times living here together," said the sprite."I'm going to see if I can't have
myself made over again, too, Spritey.I'll be pleasanter for you to look
at.What's the use of being a tin soldier in a place where even the
cobblestones are of gold and silver.""You can be plated any how," said Jimmieboy."Yes, and maybe I can have a platinum sword put in, and a real solid
gold head--but just at present that isn't what I want," said the major."What I am after now is a piece of birthday cake with real fruit raisins
in it and strips of citron two inches long, the whole concealed beneath
a one inch frosting."I don't think we have any here," said Jimmieboy, who was much pleased
to see the sprite and the major, both of whom he dearly loved, on such
good terms."But I'll run home and see if I can get some.""Well, we'll all go with you," said the colonel, starting up and
ordering the trumpeters to sound the call to arms."All except Blueface and myself," said the sprite."We will stay here
and put everything in readiness for your return.""That is a good idea," said Jimmieboy."And you'll have to hurry for we
shall be back very soon."This, as it turned out, was a very rash promise for Jimmieboy to make,
for after he and the tin soldiers had got the birthday cake and were
ready to enter Pictureland once more, they found that not one of them
could do it, the frame was so high up and the picture itself so hard
and impenetrable.Jimmieboy felt so badly to be unable to return to his
friends, that, following the major's hint about sleep bringing
forgetfulness of trouble, he threw himself down on the nursery couch,
and closing his brimming eyes dozed off into a dreamless sleep.It was quite dark when he opened them again and found himself still on
the couch with a piece of his papa's birthday cake in his hand, his
sorrows all gone and contentment in their place.His papa was sitting at
his side, and his mamma was standing over by the window smiling."You've had a good long nap, Jimmieboy," said she, "and I rather think,
from several things I've heard you say in your sleep, you've been
dreaming about your tin soldiers.""I don't believe it was a dream, mamma," he said, "it was all too real."And then he told his papa all that had happened."Well, it is very singular," said his papa, when Jimmieboy had finished,
"and if you want to believe it all happened you may; but you say all the
soldiers came back with you except Major Blueface?""Yes, every one," said Jimmieboy."Then we can tell whether it was true or not by looking in the tin
soldier's box.If the major isn't there he may be up in Fortyforefoot
castle as you say."Jimmieboy climbed eagerly down from the couch and rushing to the toy
closet got out the box of soldiers and searched it from top to bottom.The major was not to be seen anywhere, nor to this day has Jimmieboy
ever again set eyes upon him.Transcriber's Note:

RUBY.CHAPTER I.

AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS.“We shall think on Christmas morning
    Of our dear ones far away,
  Wafting them the tender wishes
    That, alas!we cannot say;
  Longing for their presence with us,
    Eye to eye, and hand to hand,
  On that day of happy meetings,
    Joy and peace throughout the land.”


Christmas Day in the Australian bush!Not the sort of Christmas Day we
dwellers in bonnie Scotland or merry England are accustomed to.The
sun is blazing down in remorseless strength upon the parched ground,
where the few trees about the station cast so slight a shadow.Past the
foot of the straggling garden the little creek dances and ripples on
its way to the river, half a mile away, and, as far as eye can reach,
stretch the blue distances of bush in long, monotonous undulation.“Wish he’d come,” says Ruby.“The pudding will be quite cold.”

On such a day as this it does not seem of paramount importance whether
the pudding be hot or cold.In fact, Christmas Day though it be, it
would be rather a relief to have a cold pudding than otherwise.Ruby’s anxious little face testifies that such is not her opinion.She
has come out to the verandah, and, shading her eyes with her hand from
the white glare of the sun, gazes now this way, now that.“Ruby!” comes a rather querulous voice from the room beyond the shady
blue blinds.The little girl gives one last long glance in every direction, then
lets the shading hand drop, and passes through the open doorway of the
pretty cottage which is Ruby’s home.“Isn’t he coming, Ruby?”

The yellow-haired woman lying on the sofa is Ruby’s step-mother.The
roses of the once pretty pink cheeks have paled to white, and there are
fretful little lines about the corners of the mouth, and a discontented
expression in the big blue eyes; but with it all Mrs.Thorne has
pretensions to beauty still.“He’s not in sight yet, mamma,” returns Ruby, wrinkling up her brow.Thorne “mamma,” for the fair-faced unaffectionate woman
is the only mother the child has ever known.Ruby was only a baby when
her own mother died, and “mamma in heaven” is a far less real personage
to her little daughter than “mamma” on earth.“It’s very tiresome.” The lady’s tone is peevish, and she fans herself
languidly with a large fan lying by her side.“I can’t conceive what
makes your father so irregular at mealtimes.Do bring me something cool
to drink, Ruby, like a good child.This heat is intolerable.”

The “station” is built in a quadrangle, and across one corner of this
quadrangle Ruby has to go ere she reaches the kitchen.If it is hot in
the living room, it is ten times hotter here, where Jenny, a stout,
buxom Scotchwoman of forty or thereabouts, who for love of her mistress
has braved the loneliness of bush life, is busy amidst her pots and
pans getting ready the Christmas dinner.“Dad’s not come yet, Jenny,” Ruby says as she reaches down a tumbler
and prepares the cooling drink which her step-mother has requested.“Do
you think the pudding will keep all right?”

“It’ll be none the waur if he’ll no be that long,” Jenny returns,
giving the fire a stir-up.“I’d no mind the cookin’ if it wasna’ for
the heat; but the heat’s maist awfu’.To
think o’ the Christmas they’ll be havin’ in Scotland too.It a’most
gars me greet to think o’ it a’, Miss Ruby, and us awa’ in this
queer-like place.It’s fine enough to say that fortunes can be made out
here; but I wad rather dae wi’out the fortune an’ stay at hame.”

“But, you see, this is home now,” Ruby says, stirring up her decoction
gravely.“That’s what papa always says when mamma gets cross.Mamma
doesn’t like staying here, you see.She says Scotland never seemed so
bonnie as when she’s away from it.And I’m Scotch, too.” Ruby gives her
head rather a proud little toss.But of course I
don’t remember Scotland--hardly,” the little girl admits slowly.The tumbler has received its final stir-up now, and Ruby carries it
through the blazing sun of the courtyard to her step-mother, still
lying on the sofa.“I’ll fan you, mamma, while you’re drinking it, and that’ll make you
feel cooler.”

“Thanks, dear; you _are_ a good little girl,” her mother says, with an
approving pat for the small hand wielding the fan.Ruby’s heart gives a great leap of joy.It is so seldom that her
step-mother speaks to her like this.Thorne is unkind
to her husband’s little daughter; but, wrapped up in herself and
her own ailments, she has but small sympathy to waste on others.Had
she seen the gladness which shone out of the child’s eyes at the
unaccustomed words of kindness, she might have spoken them oftener.Though she loves her husband as much as it is possible for such a
nature to love any one, it has been a bitter trial to Dora Thorne,
reared midst the refinements of a Scottish home, to leave friends
and kindred for his sake, and to exchange the well-known, well-loved
heather-hilled land of her birth for the hardships and uncertainties
of the Australian bush.So perhaps it is no wonder that her time is so
taken up in commiserating herself that she has but little leisure left
to commiserate or sympathize with any one else.Suddenly Ruby raises her head, a “listening” look on her face.“That’s him!” she cries.“I hear him coming now!”

The child rushes out to the verandah, and again shades her eyes with
her hand.Through the sunlight, across the cleared space of grass which
surrounds the station, a horse and rider are coming.With the sunny
glare in her eyes, it is not until he is quite near that Ruby sees
that the approaching figure really is her father.Strangers do not
come often to Glengarry; but it so chances that now and again a stray
traveller on his way to the coast claims the hospitality of the station.He swings off his horse at the garden-gate, flings the reins to Dick,
the stable-boy, and stoops to kiss the face of the little girl who has
run out to meet him.“I thought you were just never coming, dad,” complains Ruby,
plaintively.“And Jenny’s afraid the pudding’ll be spoilt.It’s been
ready ever so long.”

“Here I am at last anyway, little woman,” laughs the big man, whose
brown eyes are so like Ruby’s, and whose voice is the sweetest sound in
the world to his little daughter.He goes into the house, with the child hanging upon his arm, her big
eyes gazing up at him, reflecting every smile in the dear face above
her.The love between those two is a very beautiful thing, like that
sweet old-fashioned love of which we read, that it was “passing that of
women.”

“I thought you were never coming, Will,” says his wife, giving vent
to her thoughts in the same words as Ruby.“You do look hot, and
no wonder; for it is hot enough even in here.And I have _such_ a
headache.”

“Poor little Dolly!”

Surely a shade of regret passes over the bronzed face as he strokes the
soft golden hair with his big rough hand.He is reproaching himself
that he has not been unselfish enough, as many a man has, to face the
battle alone, instead of bringing this fragile little Dolly of his away
from the dear “kent faces” of the land where she was born, to brave the
rough life and hardships of the Australian bush.And before his eyes
uprises another face--a young, bright, dauntless face, with fearless
grey eyes--the the face of Ruby’s mother, who would have gone through
fire and water for the sake of the man she loved; but who, in her quiet
Scottish home, had not been called upon to do any great thing, only to
leave her husband and child when the King called her away to that other
land which is fairer even than the dearly loved bonnie Scotland she
left behind.It is no one’s fault that the wrong woman seems to have been put in
the wrong place, that the fearless Scottish lassie who would fain have
proved her love for her husband by braving peril and hardship for his
sake, had comfortable circumstances and a peaceful life for her lot,
and that the fair-faced, ease-loving woman who came after her should
have had to brave those very hardships which the first had coveted.To Ruby her own mother is nothing more than a name, and Scotland itself
not much more.She was only three years old when the new golden-haired
mother came home, and but little more when the reverses followed which
forced her father to seek his fortune in an unknown land over the sea.And Australia is now, as Ruby has said to Jenny, “home.”

The child goes dancing off, and across the sunshine of the quadrangle
to tell Jenny to bring the Christmas dinner in.It is a dinner which is
much too hot for an Australian bush Christmas; but, if we happen to be
Scottish, let us be Scottish or die!“I shouldn’t have brought you out here, Dolly,” the husband is saying.He has said the same thing for the last half-dozen years; but that does
not mend matters, or bring the faded pink back to his Dolly’s cheeks.But she likes to hear him say it, poor little woman.It shows that he
sympathizes with those not always imaginary ailments of hers.“You’ll take me home again soon, Will,” she coaxes, clinging to him.Unlike Ruby, far-away Scotland is still home to Dora Thorne.“Now that
you are getting on so well.Just for a little while to see them all.Couldn’t you manage, Will?”

“No saying, darling,” he responds brightly.He does not think it
necessary to trouble this fragile little wife of his with the knowledge
that things are not going on quite “so well” at present as she seems to
fancy.“Next Christmas Day, God willing, we’ll try to spend in bonnie
Scotland.That brings the roses to your cheeks, little girl!”

It has brought the roses to her cheeks, the light to her violet eyes.Dora Thorne looks as young just now as she did one far-off June day
when she plighted her troth to the man of her choice in the old parish
kirk at home.“Do you hear what papa says, Ruby?” she says when they are all three
sitting at dinner, and the faintest breath of wind is stirring the blue
blinds gently.“That we are going to Scotland for next Christmas Day,
to dear bonnie Scotland, with its heather and its bluebells.I must
write to the home people and tell them to-night.How glad they all will
be!”

“O-oh!” cries Ruby, with wide-open brown eyes.Then, as another
possibility dawns upon her, “But am I to go too?”

“If we go, of course our little girl will go with us,” her father
assures her.the
dear, unknown land where she was born!The land, which to mamma and
Jenny is the one land of all, far above all others!“Will Jenny go too?” she inquires further.The two elders look doubtfully at each other.“I don’t know,” says mamma at length rather lamely.“Don’t say
anything to her about it just now, Ruby, till it is quite settled.”

Quite settled!In Ruby’s mind it is quite settled already.She goes
out to the verandah after dinner, and, swinging idly in the hammock,
indulges in the luxury of dreaming.Above her stretches the cloudless
blue of the Australian sky, for miles on her every hand lie the
undulations of Australian bush; but Ruby is far away from it all, away
in bonnie Scotland, with its rippling burns and purple heather, away
in the land where her mother lived and died, and where Ruby’s own baby
eyes first opened.“It’s about too good to be true,” the little girl is thinking.“It’s
like dreaming, and then you waken from the dream and find it’s all just
a make-up.What if this was a dream too?”

It is not a dream, as Ruby finds after she has dealt herself several
sharp pinches, her most approved method of demonstrating to herself
that reality really is reality.No dream, she has found by experience,
can long outlast such treatment.But by-and-by even reality passes into dreaming, and Ruby goes to
sleep, the rippling of the creek in her ears, and the sunshine of the
Christmas afternoon falling aslant upon her face.In her dreams the splash of the creek is transformed into the babble of
a Highland burn over the stones, and the sunshine is the sunshine of
dear, unknown, bonnie Scotland.[Illustration]




CHAPTER II.“As I lay a-thynkynge, a-thynkynge, a-thynkynge,
  Merrie sang the birde as she sat upon the spraye!There came a noble knyghte,
      With his hauberke shynynge brighte,
      And his gallant heart was lyghte,
          Free and gaye;
  As I lay a-thynkynge, he rode upon his waye.”

                                         INGOLDSBY.Ruby always remembers the day that Jack came to the station.It is the twenty-sixth day of December, the day after Christmas, and
Ruby, having busied herself about the house most of the morning, in her
usual small way, has gone down to the creek to do Fanny and Bluebell’s
washing.There is no reason in the world why those young ladies’ washing should
not be undertaken in the privacy of the kitchen, save that Jenny, in
an inadvertent moment, has enlightened her young mistress as to the
primitive Highland way of doing washing, and has, moreover, shown her a
tiny wood-cut of the same, carefully preserved in her large-print Bible.It is no matter to Ruby that the custom is now almost obsolete.The
main thing is that it is Scottish, and Scottish in every respect Ruby
has quite determined to be.Fanny and Bluebell sit in upright waxen and wooden silence against a
stone, wrapped each in a morsel of calico, as most of their garments
are now immersed in water.Bluebell is a brunette of the wooden-jointed
species, warranted to outlive the hardest usage at the hands of her
young owner.She has lost the roses from her cheeks, the painted wig
from her head, one leg, and half an arm, in the struggle for existence;
but Bluebell is still good for a few years more wear.The painted wig
Ruby has restored from one of old Hans’ paint-pots when he renewed the
station outbuildings last summer; but the complexion and the limbs are
beyond her power.And what is the use of giving red cheeks to a doll
whose face is liable to be washed at least once a day?Fanny, the waxen blonde, has fared but little better.Like Bluebell,
she is one-legged, and possesses a nose from which any pretensions to
wax have long been worn away by too diligent use of soap and water.Her flaxen head of hair is her own, and so are her arms, albeit those
latter limbs are devoid of hands.Dolls have no easier a time of it in
the Australian bush than anywhere else.It is not amiss, this hot December morning, to paddle one’s hands in
the cooling water, and feel that one is busily employed at the same
time.The sun beats down on the large white hat so diligently bent
above the running creek.Ruby, kneeling on a large boulder, is busily
engaged wringing out Bluebell’s pink calico dress, when a new idea
comes to her.She will “tramp” the clothes as they are doing in the
picture of the “Highland washing.”

Such an idea is truly delightful, and Ruby at once begins to put it
into practice by sitting down and unbuttoning her shoes.But the hand
unfastening the second button pauses, and the face beneath the large
white hat is uplifted, the brown eyes shining.The sound of horse’s
hoofs is coming nearer and nearer.“It’s dad!” Ruby’s face is aglow now.“He’s come back earlier than he
thought.”

The washing is all forgotten, and flying feet make for the little side
garden-gate, where the rider is in a leisurely manner dismounting from
his horse.“Oh, dad!” the little girl cries, then pauses, for surely this figure
is not her father’s.Ruby pulls down her hat, the better to see, and
looks up at him.He is giving his horse in charge to brown-faced Dick,
and, raising his hat, comes towards Ruby.“Good morning,” he says politely, showing all his pretty even white
teeth in a smile.“This is Glengarry, is it not?I am on my way to the
coast, and was directed to Mr.Thorne’s as the nearest station.”

“Yes,” returns Ruby, half shyly, “this is Glengarry.Won’t you come in
and rest.Mamma is at home, though papa is away.”

Ruby knows quite what to do in the circumstances.Strangers do not come
often to Glengarry; but still they come sometimes.“Thanks,” answers the young man.He is of middle stature, with rather a tendency to stoop, and is of a
complexion which would be delicate were it not so sunburnt, with light
brown hair, dark brown eyes, and a smile which lights up his face like
sunlight as he speaks.Ruby leads him along the verandah, where the flowering plants twine up
the pillars, and into the room with the shady blue blinds.“It’s a gentleman, mamma,” Ruby gives as introduction.“He is on his
way to the coast.”

When Ruby has finished her washing, spread out all the small garments
to dry and bleach upon the grass, and returned to the house, she finds
the stranger still there.The mistress had said he was to wait over
dinner, so she learns from Jenny.“Oh, there you are, Ruby!” her step-mother says as the little girl
comes into the room.“What did you run away for, child?Kirke
fancies you must have been shy of him.”

“Little girls often are,” says Mr.Kirke, with that smile which
illumines an otherwise plain face.“They think I’m cross.”

“_I_ don’t think so!” decides Ruby, suddenly.She is gazing up into
those other brown eyes above her, and is fascinated, as most others
are, by Jack Kirke’s face--a face stern in repose, and far from
beautiful, but lit up by a smile as bright as God’s own sunlight, and
as kind.“_You_ don’t think so?” repeats the young man, with another smile for
the fair little face uplifted to his.He puts his arm round the child
as he speaks, and draws her towards him.“You are the little girl who
thinks such a lot of Scotland,” Jack Kirke says.“How did you know?” Ruby questions, looking up with wide brown eyes.“I rather think a little bird must have sung it to me as I came along,”
the stranger answers gravely.“Besides, I’m Scotch, so of course I
know.”

“Oh-h!” ejaculates Ruby, her eyes growing bigger then.“Tell me about
Scotland.”

So, with one arm round Ruby, the big brown eyes gazing up into the
honest ones above her, and the sunshine, mellowed by the down-drawn
blinds, flooding on the two brown heads, Jack Kirke tells the little
girl all about the unknown land of Scotland, and his birthplace, the
grey little seaport town of Greenock, on the beautiful river Clyde.“You must come and see me if ever you come to Scotland, you know,
Ruby,” he tells her.“I’m on my way home now, and shall be jolly glad
to get there; for, after all, there’s no place like home, and no place
in all the world like bonnie Scotland.”

“Do you think that too?” Ruby cries delightedly.“That’s what mamma
always says, and Jenny.I don’t remember Scotland,” Ruby continues,
with a sigh; “but I dare say, if I did, I should say it too.And by
next Christmas I shall have seen it.Dad says, ‘God willing;’ but I
don’t see the good of that when we really are going to go.Kirke?”

The sunlight is still flooding the room; but its radiance has died
away from Jack Kirke’s face, leaving it for the moment cold and stern.Ruby is half frightened as she looks up at him.What has chased the
brightness from the face a moment ago so glad?“When you are as old as dad and I you will be thankful if you can say
just that, little girl,” he says in a strange, strained voice.Kirke is sorry about something, though she
does not know what, and, child-like, seeks to comfort him in the grief
she does not know.“I’m sorry too,” she whispers simply.Again that flash of sunlight illumines the stern young face.The
child’s words of ready sympathy have fallen like summer rain into the
heart of the stranger far from home and friends, and the grief she does
not even understand is somehow lessened by her innocent words.“Ruby,” he says suddenly, looking into the happy little face so near
his own, “I want you to do something for me.Nobody has called me that since I left home, and it would make it
feel like old times to hear you say it.Don’t be afraid because I’m too
old.It isn’t so very long ago since I was young like you.”

“Jack,” whispers Ruby, almost shyly.“Good little girl!” Jack Kirke says approvingly.A very beautiful light
is shining in his brown eyes, and he stoops suddenly and kisses the
wondering child.“I must send you out a Christmas present for that,”
Jack adds.“What is it to be, Ruby?A new doll?”

“You must excuse me, Mr.Kirke,” the lady of the house observes
apologetically as she comes back to the room.She has actually taken
the trouble to cross the quadrangle to assist Jenny in sundry small
matters connected with the midday meal.“I am sorry I had to leave you
for a little,” Mrs.“I hope Ruby has been entertaining
you.”

“Ruby is a hostess in herself,” Jack Kirke returns, laughing.“Yes, and mamma!” cries Ruby.“I’m to go to see him in Scotland.Jack
says so, in Green--Green----I can’t remember the name of the place; but
it’s where they build ships, beside the river.”

“Ruby!” her step-mother remonstrates, horror-stricken.“Who’s Jack?”

“Him!” cries Ruby, triumphantly, a fat forefinger denoting her
new-found friend.“He said I was to call him Jack,” explains the little
girl.“Didn’t you, Jack?”

“Of course I did,” that young man says good-naturedly.“And promised to
send you a doll for doing it, the very best that Greenock or Glasgow
can supply.”

It is evident that the pair have vowed eternal friendship--a friendship
which only grows as the afternoon goes on.Thorne comes home he insists that the young Scotchman shall
stay the night, which Jack Kirke is nothing loth to do.Ruby even
does him the honour of introducing him to both her dolls and to her
bleaching green, and presents him with supreme dignity to Jenny as “Mr.Kirke, a gentleman from Scotland.”

“I wish next Christmas wasn’t so far away, Jack,” Ruby says that
evening as they sit on the verandah.“It’s such a long time till ever
we see you again.”

“And yet you never saw me before this morning,” says the young man,
laughing.He is both pleased and flattered by the affection which the
little lady has seen fit to shower upon him.“And I dare say that by
this time to-morrow you will have forgotten that there is such a person
in existence,” Jack adds teasingly.“We won’t ever forget you,” Ruby protests loyally.He’s just the nicest ‘stranger’ that ever came to Glengarry since we
came.”

“There’s a decided compliment for you, Mr.Kirke,” laughs Ruby’s
father.“I’m getting quite jealous of your attentions, little woman.It
is well you are not a little older, or Mr.Kirke might find them very
much too marked.”

The white moonlight is flooding the land when at length they retire to
rest.Ruby’s dreams are all of her new-found friend whom she is so soon
to lose, and when she is awakened by the sunlight of the newer morning
streaming in upon her face a rush of gladness and of sorrow strive
hard for mastery in her heart--gladness because Jack is still here,
sorrow because he is going away.Her father is to ride so far with the traveller upon his way, and Ruby
stands with dim eyes at the garden-gate watching them start.“Good-bye, little Ruby red,” Jack Kirke says as he stoops to kiss her.“Remember next Christmas, and remember the new dolly I’m to send you
when I get home.”

“Good-bye, Jack,” Ruby whispers in a choked voice.“I’ll always
remember you; and, Jack, if there’s any other little girl in Scotland
you’ll perhaps like better than me, I’ll try not to mind _very_ much.”

Jack Kirke twirls his moustache and smiles.There _is_ another little
girl in the question, a little girl whom he has known all her life,
and who is all the world to her loyal-hearted lover.The only question
now at issue is as to whether Jack Kirke is all the world to the woman
whom, he has long since decided, like Geraint of old, is the “one maid”
for him.Then the two riders pass out into the sunshine, Jack Kirke with a last
look back and a wave of the hand for the desolate little blue figure
left standing at the gate.“Till next Christmas, Ruby!” his voice rings out cheerily, and then
they are gone, through a blaze of sunlight which shines none the
dimmer because Ruby sees it through a mist of tears.It is her first remembered tasting of that most sorrowful of all words,
“Good-bye,” a good-bye none the less bitter that the “good morning”
came to her but in yesterday’s sunshine.It is not always those whom we
have known the longest whom we love the best.Even the thought of the promised new doll fails to comfort the little
girl in this her first keenest sorrow of parting.For long she stands
at the gate, gazing out into the sunlight, which beats down hotly upon
her uncovered head.“It’s only till next Christmas anyway,” Ruby murmurs with a shadowy
attempt at a smile.“And it won’t be so _very_ long to pass.”

She rubs her eyes with her hand as she speaks, and is almost surprised,
when she draws it away, to find a tear there.[Illustration]

CHAPTER III.“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward
    men.”


“May?” Ruby says.“I wonder who that can be?”

She turns the card with its illuminated wreath of holly and
conventional glistening snow scene this way and that.“It’s very
pretty,” the little girl murmurs admiringly.“But who can ‘May’ be?”

The Christmas card under inspection has been discovered by Jenny upon
the floor of the room where Mr.Jack Kirke has spent the night, dropped
there probably in the hurried start of the morning.It has evidently
been a very precious thing in its owner’s eyes, this card; for it is
wrapped in a little piece of white tissue paper and enclosed in an
unsealed envelope.Jenny has forthwith delivered this treasure over
to Ruby, who, seated upon the edge of the verandah, is now busily
scrutinizing it.“Jack, from May,” is written upon the back of the card in a large
girlish scrawl.That is all; there is no date, no love or good wishes
sent, only those three words: “Jack, from May;” and in front of the
card, beneath the glittering snow scene and intermingling with the
scarlet wreath, the Christmas benediction: “Glory to God in the
highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”

“Who’s May, I wonder,” Ruby murmurs again, almost jealously.“P’raps
another little girl in Scotland he never told me about.I wonder why he
didn’t speak about her.”

Ruby does not know that the “May” of the carefully cherished card is
a little girl of whom Jack but rarely speaks, though she lives in his
thoughts day and night.Far away in Scotland a blue-eyed maiden’s heart
is going out in longing to the man who only by his absence had proved
to the friend of his childhood how much she loved him.Her heart is in
sunny Australia, and his in bonnie Scotland, all for love each of the
other.Having failed, even with the best intentions to discover who May is,
Ruby turns her attention to the picture and the text.“‘Glory to God in the highest,’” the little girl reads--“that’s out of
the Bible--‘and on earth peace, good will toward men.’ I wonder what
‘good will’ means?I s’pose p’raps it just means to be kind.”

All around the child is the monotonous silence of the Australian noon,
unbroken save by the faint silvery wash of the creek over the stones
on its way to the river, and the far-away sound of old Hans’ axe as he
“rings” the trees.To be “kind,” that is what the Christmas text means
in Ruby’s mind, but there is no one here to be “kind” to.“And of course that card would be made in Scotland, where there are
lots of people to be kind to,” the little girl decides thoughtfully.She is gazing out far away over the path which leads to the coast.Beyond that lies the sea, and beyond the sea Scotland.What would not
Ruby give to be in bonnie Scotland just now!The child rises and goes through the house and across the courtyard
to the stables.The stables are situated on the fourth side of the
quadrangle; but at present are but little used, as most of the horses
are grazing at their own sweet will in the adjoining paddock just now.Dick comes out of the coach-house pulling his forelock.This building
is desolate save for a very dilapidated conveyance termed “buggy” in
Australia.“Wantin’ to go for a ride, Miss Ruby?” Dick asks.Dick is Ruby’s
cavalier upon those occasions when she desires to ride abroad.“Smuttie’s out in the paddock.I’ll catch him for you if you like,” he
adds.“Bring him round to the gate,” his young mistress says.“I’ll have got
on my things by the time you’ve got him ready.”

Smuttie is harnessed and ready by the time Ruby reappears.He justifies
his name, being a coal-black pony, rather given over to obesity, but a
good little fellow for all that.Dick has hitched his own pony to the
garden-gate, and now stands holding Smuttie’s bridle, and awaiting his
little mistress’s will.The sun streams brightly down upon them as they start, Ruby riding
slowly ahead.In such weather Smuttie prefers to take life easily.It
is with reluctant feet that he has left the paddock at all; but now
that he has, so to speak, been driven out of Eden, he is resolved in
his pony heart that he will not budge one hair’s-breadth quicker than
necessity requires.Dick has fastened a handkerchief beneath his broad-brimmed hat, and his
young mistress is not slow to follow his example and do the same.“Hot enough to start a fire without a light,” Dick remarks from behind
as they jog along.“I never saw one,” Ruby returns almost humbly.She knows that Dick
refers to a bush fire, and that for a dweller in the bush she ought
long before this to have witnessed such a spectacle.“I suppose it’s
very frightsome,” Ruby adds.I should just think so!” Dick ejaculates.He laughs to
himself at the question.“Saw one the last place I was in,” the boy
goes on.Your pa’s never had one
here, Miss Ruby; but it’s not every one that’s as lucky.It’s just
like”--Dick pauses for a simile--“like a steam-engine rushing along,
for all the world, the fire is.Then you can see it for miles and miles
away, and it’s all you can do to keep up with it and try to burn on
ahead to keep it out.If you’d seen one, Miss Ruby, you’d never like to
see another.”

Rounding a thicket, they come upon old Hans, the German, busy in his
employment of “ringing” the trees.This ringing is the Australian
method of thinning a forest, and consists in notching a ring or circle
about the trunks of the trees, thus impeding the flow of sap to the
branches, and causing in time their death.The trees thus “ringed”
form indeed a melancholy spectacle, their long arms stretched bare and
appealingly up to heaven, as if craving for the blessing of growth now
for ever denied them.The old German raises his battered hat respectfully to the little
mistress.“Hot day, missie,” he mutters as salutation.“You must be dreadfully hot,” Ruby says compassionately.The old man’s face is hot enough in all conscience.He raises his
broad-brimmed hat again, and wipes the perspiration from his damp
forehead with a large blue-cotton handkerchief.“It’s desp’rate hot,” Dick puts in as his item to the conversation.“You ought to take a rest, Hans,” the little girl suggests with ready
commiseration.“I’m sure dad wouldn’t mind.He doesn’t like me to do
things when it’s so hot, and he wouldn’t like you either.Your face is
just ever so red, as red as the fire, and you look dreadful tired.”

“Ach!and I _am_ tired,” the old man ejaculates, with a broad smile.But a little more work, a little more tiring out,
and the dear Lord will send for old Hans to be with Him for ever in
that best and brightest land of all.The work has
not come to those little hands of thine yet, but the day may come when
thou too wilt be glad to leave the toil behind thee, and be at rest.but what am I saying?” The smile broadens on the tired old face.“Why do I talk of death to thee, _liebchen_, whose life is all play?The sunlight is made for such as thee, on whom the shadows have not
even begun to fall.”

Ruby gives just the tiniest suspicion of a sob stifled in a sniff.“You’re not to talk like that, Hans,” she remonstrates in rather an
injured manner.“We don’t want you to die--do we, Dick?” she appeals to
her faithful servitor.“No more’n we don’t,” Dick agrees.“So you see,” Ruby goes on with the air of a small queen, “you’re not
to say things like that ever again.And I’ll tell dad you’re not to
work so hard; dad always does what I want him to do--usually.”

The old man looks after the two retreating figures as they ride away.“She’s a dear little lady, she is,” he mutters to himself.“But she
can’t be expected to understand, God bless her!how the longing comes
for the home-land when one is weary.Good Lord, let it not be long.”
The old man’s tired eyes are uplifted to the wide expanse of blue,
beyond which, to his longing vision, lies the home-land for which he
yearns.Then, wiping his axe upon his shirt-sleeve, old Hans begins his
“ringing” again.“He’s a queer old boy,” Dick remarks as they ride through the sunshine.Though a servant, and obliged to ride behind, Dick sees no reason why
he should be excluded from conversation.She would have
found those rides over the rough bush roads very dull work had there
been no Dick to talk to.“He’s a nice old man!” Ruby exclaims staunchly.“He’s just tired, or
he wouldn’t have said that,” she goes on.She has an idea that Dick is
rather inclined to laugh at German Hans.They are riding along now by the river’s bank, where the white clouds
floating across the azure sky, and the tall grasses by the margin are
reflected in its cool depths.About a mile or so farther on, at the
turn of the river, a ruined mill stands, while, far as eye can reach on
every hand, stretch unending miles of bush.Dick’s eyes have been fixed
on the mill; but now they wander to Ruby.“We’d better turn ’fore we get there, Miss Ruby,” he recommends,
indicating the tumbledown building with the willowy switch he has been
whittling as they come along.“That’s the place your pa don’t like you
for to pass--old Davis, you know.Your pa’s been down on him lately for
stealing sheep.”

“I’m sure dad won’t mind,” cries Ruby, with a little toss of the head.“And I want to go,” she adds, looking round at Dick, her bright face
flushed with exercise, and her brown hair flying behind her like a
veritable little Amazon.Dick knows by sore experience that when
this little lady wants her own way she usually gets it.“Your pa said,” he mutters; but it is all of no avail, and they
continue their course by the river bank.The cottage stands with its back to the river, the mill, now idle and
unused, is built alongside.Once on a day this same mill was a busy
enough place, now it is falling to decay for lack of use, and no sign
or sound either there or at the cottage testify to the whereabouts of
the lonely inhabitant.An enormous brindled cat is mewing upon the
doorstep, a couple of gaunt hens and a bedraggled cock are pacing the
deserted gardens, while from a lean-to outhouse comes the unmistakable
grunt of a pig.“He’s not at home,” he mutters.“I’m just as glad, for your pa would
have been mighty angry with me.Somewhere not far off he’ll be, I
reckon, and up to no good.Come along, Miss Ruby; we’d better be
getting home, or the mistress’ll be wondering what’s come over you.”

They are riding homewards by the river’s bank, when they come upon a
curious figure.An old, old man, bent almost double under his load of
<DW19>s, his red handkerchief tied three cornered-wise beneath his chin
to protect his ancient head from the blazing sun.The face which looks
out at them from beneath this strange head-gear is yellow and wizened,
and the once keen blue eyes are dim and bleared, yet withal there is a
sort of low cunning about the whole countenance which sends a sudden
shiver to Ruby’s heart, and prompts Dick to touch up both ponies with
that convenient switch of his so smartly as to cause even lethargic
Smuttie to break into a canter.“Who is he?” Ruby asks in a half-frightened whisper as they slacken
pace again.She looks over her shoulder as she asks the question.The old man is standing just as they left him, gazing after them
through a flood of golden light.“He’s an old wicked one!” he mutters.“That’s him, Miss Ruby, him as we
were speaking about, old Davis, as stole your pa’s sheep.Your pa would
have had him put in prison, but that he was such an old one.He’s a bad
lot though, so he is.”

“He’s got a horrid face.I don’t like his face one bit,” says Ruby.Her
own face is very white as she speaks, and her brown eyes ablaze.“I
wish we hadn’t seen him,” shivers the little girl, as they set their
faces homewards.[Illustration]

CHAPTER IV.“I kissed thee when I went away
    On thy sweet eyes--thy lips that smiled.I heard thee lisp thy baby lore--
    Thou wouldst not learn the word farewell.God’s angels guard thee evermore,
    Till in His heaven we meet and dwell!”

                               HANS ANDERSON.It is stilly night, and she is
standing down by the creek, watching the dance and play of the water
over the stones on its way to the river.All around her the moonlight
is streaming, kissing the limpid water into silver, and in the deep
blue of the sky the stars are twinkling like gems on the robe of the
great King.Not a sound can the little girl hear save the gentle murmur of the
stream over the stones.All the world--the white, white, moon-radiant
world--seems to be sleeping save Ruby; she alone is awake.Stranger than all, though she is all alone, the child feels no sense of
dread.She is content to stand there, watching the moon-kissed stream
rushing by, her only companions those ever-watchful lights of heaven,
the stars.Faint music is sounding in her ears, music so faint and far away that
it almost seems to come from the streets of the Golden City, where the
redeemed sing the “new song” of the Lamb through an endless day.Ruby
strains her ears to catch the notes echoing through the still night in
faint far-off cadence.Nearer, ever nearer, it comes; clearer, ever clearer, ring those glad
strains of joy, till, with a great, glorious rush they seem to flood
the whole world:

“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace; good will toward men!”

“It’s on Jack’s card!” Ruby cannot help exclaiming; but the words die
away upon her lips.Gazing upwards, she sees such a blaze of glory as almost seems to blind
her.Strangely enough the thought that this is only a dream, and the
attendant necessity of pinching, do not occur to Ruby just now.She is gazing upwards in awestruck wonder to the shining sky.What is
this vision of fair faces, angel faces, hovering above her, faces
shining with a light which “never was on land or sea,” the radiance
from their snowy wings striking athwart the gloom?And in great, glorious unison the grand old Christmas carol rings
forth--

“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace; good will toward men!”

Open-eyed and awestruck, the little girl stands gazing upwards, a
wonder fraught with strange beauty at her heart.Can it be possible
that one of those bright-faced angels may be the mother whom Ruby never
knew, sent from the far-off land to bear the Christmas message to the
child who never missed a mother’s love because she never knew it?“Oh, mamma,” cries poor Ruby, stretching appealing hands up to the
shining throng, “take me with you!Take me with you back to heaven!”

She hardly knows why the words rise to her lips.Heaven has never been
a very real place to this little girl, although her mother is there;
the far-off city, with its pearly gates and golden streets, holds but
a shadowy place in Ruby’s heart, and before to-night she has never
greatly desired to enter therein.The life of the present has claimed all her attention, and, amidst
the joys and pleasures of to-day, the coming life has held but little
place.But now, with heaven’s glories almost opened before her, with
the “new song” of the blessed in her ears, with her own long-lost
mother so near, Ruby would fain be gone.Slowly the glory fades away, the angel faces grow dimmer and dimmer,
the heavenly music dies into silence, and the world is calm and hushed
as before.Still Ruby stands gazing upwards, longing for the angel
visitants to come again.But no heavenly light illumines the sky, only
the pale radiance of the moon, and no sound breaks upon the child’s
listening ear save the monotonous music of the ever-flowing water.With a disappointed little sigh, Ruby brings her gaze back to earth
again.The white moonlight is flooding the country for miles around,
and in its light the ringed trees in the cleared space about the
station stand up gaunt and tall like watchful sentinels over this
home in the lonely bush.Yet Ruby has no desire to retrace her steps
homewards.It may be that the angel host with their wondrous song will
come again.So the child lingers, throwing little pebbles in the brook,
and watching the miniature circles widen and widen, brightened to
limpid silver in the sheeny light.A halting footstep makes her turn her head.There, a few paces away,
a bent figure is coming wearifully along, weighted down beneath its
bundle of <DW19>s.Near Ruby it stumbles and falls, the <DW19>s
rolling from the wearied back down to the creek, where, caught by a
boulder, they swing this way and that in the flowing water.Involuntarily the child gives a step forward, then springs back with
a sudden shiver.“It’s the wicked old one,” she whispers.“And I
_couldn’t_ help him!Oh, I _couldn’t_ help him!”

“On earth peace, good will toward men!” Faint and far away is the echo,
yet full of meaning to the child’s heart.She gives a backward glance
over her shoulder at the fallen old man.He is groping with his hands
this way and that, as though in darkness, and the blood is flowing from
a cut in the ugly yellow wizened face.“If it wasn’t _him_,” Ruby mutters.“If it was anybody else but the
wicked old one; but I can’t be kind to _him_.”

“On earth peace, good will toward men!” Clearer and clearer rings out
the angel benison, sent from the gates of heaven, where Ruby’s mother
waits to welcome home again the husband and child from whose loving
arms she was so soon called away.To be “kind,” that is what Ruby has
decided “good will” means.Is she, then, being kind, to the old man
whose groping hands appeal so vainly to her aid?“Dad wouldn’t like me to,” decides Ruby, trying to stifle the voice of
conscience.“And he’s _such_ a horrid old man.”

Clearer and still clearer, higher and still higher rings out the
angels’ singing.There is a queer sort of tugging going on at Ruby’s
heart.She knows she ought to go back to help old Davis and yet she
cannot--cannot!Then a great flash of light comes before her eyes, and Ruby suddenly
wakens to find herself in her own little bed, the white curtains drawn
closely to ward off mosquitoes, and the morning sun slanting in and
forming a long golden bar on the opposite curtain.The little girl rubs her eyes and stares about her.She, who has so
often even doubted reality, finds it hard to believe that what has
passed is really a dream.Even yet the angel voices seem to be sounding
in her ears, the heavenly light dazzling her eyes.“And they weren’t angels, after all,” murmurs Ruby in a disappointed
voice.“It was only a dream.”

Only a dream!How many of our so-called realities are “only a dream,”
from which we waken with disappointed hearts and saddened eyes.One far
day there will come to us that which is not a dream, but a reality,
which can never pass away, and we shall awaken in heaven’s morning,
being “satisfied.”

“Dad,” asks Ruby as they go about the station that morning, she hanging
on her father’s arm, “what was my mamma like--my own mamma, I mean?”

The big man smiles, and looks down into the eager little face uplifted
to his own.“Your own mamma, little woman,” he repeats gently.of course you don’t remember her.You remind me of her, Ruby, in a
great many ways, and it is my greatest wish that you grow up just such
a woman as your dear mother was.I
don’t think you ever asked me about your mother before.”

“I just wondered,” says Ruby.She is gazing up into the cloudless blue
of the sky, which has figured so vividly in her dream of last night.“I
wish I remembered her,” Ruby murmurs, with the tiniest sigh.“Poor little lassie!” says the father, patting the small hand.“Her
greatest sorrow was in leaving you, Ruby.You were just a baby when she
died.Not long before she went away she spoke about you, her little
girl whom she was so unwilling to leave.‘Tell my little Ruby,’ she
said, ‘that I shall be waiting for her.I have prayed to the dear Lord
Jesus that she may be one of those whom He gathers that day when He
comes to make up His jewels.’ She used to call you her little jewel,
Ruby.”

“And my name means a jewel,” says Ruby, looking up into her father’s
face with big, wondering brown eyes.The dream mother has come nearer
to her little girl during those last few minutes than she has ever
done before.Those words, spoken so long ago, have made Ruby feel her
long-dead young mother to be a real personality, albeit separated from
the little girl for whom one far day she had prayed that Christ might
number her among His jewels.In that fair city, “into which no foe can
enter, and from which no friend can ever pass away,” Ruby’s mother has
done with all care and sorrow.God Himself has wiped away all tears
from her eyes for ever.Ruby goes about with a very sober little face that morning.She gathers
fresh flowers for the sitting-room, and carries the flower-glasses
across the courtyard to the kitchen to wash them out.This is one of
Ruby’s customary little duties.She has a variety of such small tasks
which fill up the early hours of the morning.After this Ruby usually
conscientiously learns a few lessons, which her step-mother hears her
recite now and then, as the humour seizes her.But at present Ruby is enjoying holidays in honour of Christmas,
holidays which the little girl has decided shall last a month or more,
if she can possibly manage it.“You’re very quiet to-day, Ruby,” observes her step-mother, as the
child goes about the room, placing the vases of flowers in their
accustomed places.Thorne is reclining upon her favourite sofa,
the latest new book which the station affords in her hand.“Aren’t you
well, child?” she asks.“Am I quiet?” Ruby says.“I didn’t notice, mamma.I’m all right.”

It is true, as the little girl has said, that she has not even noticed
that she is more quiet than usual.Involuntarily her thoughts have
gone out to the mother whom she never knew, the mother who even now is
waiting in sunny Paradise for the little daughter she has left behind.Since she left her so long ago, Ruby has hardly given a thought to her
mother.The snow is lying thick on her grave in the little Scottish
kirkyard at home; but Ruby has been happy enough without her, living
her own glad young life without fear of death, and with no thought to
spare for the heaven beyond.But now the radiant vision of last night’s dream, combined with her
father’s words, have set the child thinking.Will the Lord Jesus indeed
answer her mother’s prayer, and one day gather little Ruby among His
jewels?Will he care very much that this little jewel of His has never
tried very hard throughout her short life to work His will or do His
bidding?What if, when the Lord Jesus comes, He finds Ruby all unworthy
to be numbered amongst those jewels of His?And the long-lost mother,
who even in heaven will be the gladder that her little daughter is with
her there, how will she bear to know that the prayer she prayed so long
ago is all in vain?“And if he doesn’t gather me,” Ruby murmurs, staring straight up into
the clear, blue sky, “what shall I do?Oh, what shall I do?”

CHAPTER V.

THE BUSH FIRE.“Will you shew yourself gentle, and be merciful for Christ’s sake
    to poor and needy people, and to all strangers destitute of help?”

    “I will so shew myself, by God’s help.”

                     _Consecration of Bishops, Book of Common Prayer._


Jack’s card is placed upright on the mantel-piece of Ruby’s bedroom,
its back leaning against the wall, and before it stands a little girl
with a troubled face, and a perplexed wrinkle between her brows.“It says it there,” Ruby murmurs, the perplexed wrinkle deepening.“And
that text’s out of the Bible.But when there’s nobody to be kind to, I
can’t do anything.”

The sun is glinting on the frosted snow scene; but Ruby is not looking
at the snow scene.Her eyes are following the old, old words of the
first Christmas carol: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace, good will toward men!”

“If there was only anybody to be kind to,” the little girl repeats
slowly.“Dad and mamma don’t need me to be kind to them, and I _am_
quite kind to Hans and Dick.If it was only in Scotland now; but it’s
quite different here.”

The soft summer wind is swaying the window-blinds gently to and fro,
and ruffling with its soft breath the thirsty, parched grass about the
station.To the child’s mind has come a remembrance, a remembrance of
what was “only a dream,” and she sees an old, old man, bowed down with
the weight of years, coming to her across the moonlit paths of last
night, an old man whom Ruby had let lie where he fell, because he was
only “the wicked old one.”

“It was only a dream, so it didn’t matter.” Thus the little girl tries
to soothe a suddenly awakened conscience.“And he _is_ a wicked old
one; Dick said he was.”

Ruby goes over to the window, and stands looking out.There is no
change in the fair Australian scene; on just such a picture Ruby’s eyes
have rested since first she came.But there is a strange, unexplained
change in the little girl’s heart.Only that the dear Lord Jesus has
come to Ruby, asking her for His dear sake to be kind to one of the
lowest and humblest of His creatures.“If it was only anybody else,”
she mutters.“But he’s so horrid, and he has such a horrid face.And I
don’t see what I could do to be kind to such a nasty old man as he is.Besides, perhaps dad wouldn’t like me.”

“Good will toward men!Good will toward men!” Again the heavenly
voices seem ringing in Ruby’s ears.There is no angel host about her
to strengthen and encourage her, only one very lonely little girl who
finds it hard to do right when the doing of that right does not quite
fit in with her own inclinations.She has taken the first step upon the
heavenly way, and finds already the shadow of the cross.The radiance of the sunshine is reflected in Ruby’s brown eyes, the
radiance, it may be, of something far greater in her heart.“I’ll do it!” the little girl decides suddenly.“I’ll try to be kind to
the ‘old one.’ Only what can I do?”

“Miss Ruby!” cries an excited voice at the window, and, looking out,
Ruby sees Dick’s brown face and merry eyes.“Come ’long as quick as
you can.There’s a fire, and you said t’other day you’d never seen one.I’ll get Smuttie if you come as quick as you can.It’s over by old
Davis’s place.”

Dick’s young mistress does not need a second bidding.She is out
waiting by the garden-gate long before Smuttie is caught and harnessed.Away to the west she can see the long glare of fire shooting up tongues
of flame into the still sunlight, and brightening the river into a very
sea of blood.“I don’t think you should go, Ruby,” says her mother, who has come
out on the verandah.“It isn’t safe, and you are so venturesome.I am
dreadfully anxious about your father too.Dick says he and the men are
off to help putting out the fire; but in such weather as this I don’t
see how they can ever possibly get it extinguished.”

“I’ll be very, very careful, mamma,” Ruby promises.Her brown eyes
are ablaze with excitement, and her cheeks aglow.“And I’ll be there
to watch dad too, you know,” she adds persuasively in a voice which
expresses the belief that not much danger can possibly come to dad
while his little girl is near.Dick has brought Smuttie round to the garden-gate, and in a moment he
and his little mistress are off, cantering as fast as Smuttie can be
got to go, to the scene of the fire.Those who have witnessed a fire in the bush will never forget it.The
first spark, induced sometimes by a fallen match, ignited often by the
excessive heat of the sun’s rays, gains ground with appalling rapidity,
and where the growth is dry, large tracts of ground have often been
laid waste.In excessively hot weather this is more particularly the
case, and it is then found almost impossible to extinguish the fire.“Look at it!” Dick cries excitedly.“Goin’ like a steam-engine just.Wish we hadn’t brought Smuttie, Miss Ruby.He’ll maybe be frightened at
the fire.they’ve got the start of it.Do you see that other fire
on ahead?That’s where they’re burning down!”

Ruby looks.Yes, there _are_ two fires, both, it seems, running, as
Dick has said, “like steam-engines.”

“My!” the boy cries suddenly; “it’s the old wicked one’s house.It’s it
that has got afire.There’s not enough
of them to do that, and to stop the fire too.And it’ll be on to your
pa’s land if they don’t stop it pretty soon.I’ll have to help them,
Miss Ruby.You’ll have to get off Smuttie and hold
him in case he gets scared at the fire.”

“Oh, Dick!” the little girl cries.Her face is very pale, and her eyes
are fixed on that lurid light, ever growing nearer.“Do you think
he’ll be dead?Do you think the old man’ll be dead?”

“Not him,” Dick returns, with a grin.“He’s too bad to die, he is.but I wish he was dead!” the boy ejaculates.“It would be a good
riddance of bad rubbish, that’s what it would.”

“Oh, Dick,” shivers Ruby, “I wish you wouldn’t say that.I’ve never been kind!” Ruby
breaks out in a wail, which Dick does not understand.They are nearing the scene of the fire now.Luckily the cottage is
hard by the river, so there is no scarcity of water.Stations are scarce and far between in the
Australian bush, and the inhabitants not easily got together.There are
two detachments of men at work, one party endeavouring to extinguish
the flames of poor old Davis’s burning cottage, the others far in
the distance trying to stop the progress of the fire by burning down
the thickets in advance, and thus starving the main fire as it gains
ground.This method of “starving the fire” is well known to dwellers in
the Australian bush, though at times the second fire thus given birth
to assumes such proportions as to outrun its predecessor.“It’s not much use.It’s too dry,” Dick mutters.“I don’t like leaving
you, Miss Ruby; but I’ll have to do it.Even a boy’s a bit of help in
bringing the water.You don’t mind, do you, Miss Ruby?I think, if I
was you, now that you’ve seen it, I’d turn and go home again.Smuttie’s
easy enough managed; but if he got frightened, I don’t know what you’d
do.”

“I’ll get down and hold him,” Ruby says.“I want to watch.” Her heart
is sick within her.She has never seen a fire before, and it seems so
fraught with danger that she trembles when she thinks of dad, the being
she loves best on earth.“Go you away to the fire, Dick,” adds Ruby,
very pale, but very determined.“I’m not afraid of being left alone.”

The fire is gaining ground every moment, and poor old Davis’s desolate
home bids fair to be soon nothing but a heap of blackened ruins.Dick gives one look at the burning house, and another at his little
mistress.There is no time to waste if he is to be of any use.“I don’t like leaving you, Miss Ruby,” says Dick again; but he goes all
the same.Ruby, left alone, stands by Smuttie’s head, consoling that faithful
little animal now and then with a pat of the hand.It is hot,
scorchingly hot; but such cold dread sits at the little girl’s heart
that she does not even feel the heat.In her ears is the hissing of
those fierce flames, and her love for dad has grown to be a very agony
in the thought that something may befall him.“Ruby!” says a well-known voice, and through the blaze of sunlight she
sees her father coming towards her.His face, like Ruby’s, is very
pale, and his hands are blackened with the grime and soot.“You ought
not to be here, child.Away home to your mother,
and tell her it is all right, for I know she will be feeling anxious.”

“But is it all right, dad?” the little girl questions anxiously.Her
eyes flit from dad’s face to the burning cottage, and then to those
other figures in the lurid light far away.“And mamma _will_ be
frightened; for she’ll think you’ll be getting hurt.And so will I,”
adds poor Ruby with a little catch in her voice.“What nonsense, little girl,” says her father cheerfully.“There,
dear, I have no time to wait, so get on Smuttie, and let me see you
away.That’s a brave little girl,” he adds, stooping to kiss the small
anxious face.It is with a sore, sore heart that Ruby rides home lonely by the
river’s side.She has not waited for her trouble to come to her, but
has met it half way, as more people than little brown-eyed Ruby are too
fond of doing.Dad is the very dearest thing Ruby has in the whole wide
world, and if anything happens to dad, whatever will she do?“I just couldn’t bear it,” murmurs poor Ruby, wiping away a very big
tear which has fallen on Smuttie’s broad back.Ah, little girl with the big, tearful, brown eyes, you have still to
learn that any trouble can be borne patiently, and with a brave face to
the world, if only God gives His help![Illustration]

CHAPTER VI.“I CAN NEVER DO IT NOW!”

          “Then, darling, wait;
          Nothing is late,
  In the light that shines for ever!”


That is a long, long day to Ruby.From Glengarry they can watch far
away the flames, like so many forked and lurid tongues of fire, leaping
up into the still air and looking strangely out of place against
the hazy blue of the summer sky.The little girl leaves her almost
untouched dinner, and steals out to the verandah, where she sits, a
forlorn-looking little figure, in the glare of the afternoon sunshine,
with her knees drawn up to her chin, and her brown eyes following
eagerly the pathway by the river where she has ridden with Dick no
later than this morning.This morning!--to waiting Ruby it seems more
like a century ago.Jenny finds her there when she has washed up the dinner dishes, tidied
all for the afternoon, and come out to get what she expresses as a
“breath o’ caller air,” after her exertions of the day.The “breath
o’ air” Jenny may get; but it will never be “caller” nor anything
approaching “caller” at this season of the year.Poor Jenny, she may
well sigh for the fresh moorland breezes of bonnie Scotland with its
shady glens, where the bracken and wild hyacinth grow, and where the
very plash of the mountain torrent or “sough” of the wind among the
trees, makes one feel cool, however hot and sultry it may be.“Ye’re no cryin’, Miss Ruby?” ejaculates Jenny.“No but that the heat
o’ this outlandish place would gar anybody cry.What’s wrong wi’ ye, ma
lambie?” Jenny can be very gentle upon occasion.“Are ye no weel?” For
all her six years of residence in the bush, Jenny’s Scotch tongue is
still aggressively Scotch.Ruby raises a face in which tears and smiles struggle hard for mastery.“I’m not crying, _really_, Jenny,” she answers.“Only,” with a
suspicious droop of the dark-fringed eye-lids and at the corners of the
rosy mouth, “I was pretty near it.I can’t help watching the flames, and thinking that something might
perhaps be happening to him, and me not there to know.And then I began
to feel glad to think how nice it would be to see him and Dick come
riding home.Jenny, how _do_ little girls get along who have no
father?”

It is strange that Ruby never reflects that her own mother has gone
from her.“The Lord A’mighty tak’s care o’ such,” Jenny responds solemnly.“Ye’ll just weary your eyes glowerin’ awa’ at the fire like that, Miss
Ruby.They say that ‘a watched pot never boils,’ an’ I’m thinkin’ your
papa’ll no come a meenit suner for a’ your watchin’.Gae in an’ rest
yersel’ like the mistress.She’s sleepin’ finely on the sofa.”

Ruby gives a little impatient wriggle.“How can I, Jenny,” she exclaims
piteously, “when dad’s out there?I don’t know whatever I would do
if anything was to happen to dad.”

“Pit yer trust in the Lord, ma dearie,” the Scotchwoman says
reverently.“Ye’ll be in richt gude keepin’ then, an’ them ye love as
weel.”

But Ruby only wriggles again.She does not want Jenny’s solemn talk.Dad, whom she loves so dearly, and whose little
daughter’s heart would surely break if aught of ill befell him.So the long, long afternoon wears away, and when is an afternoon so
tedious as when one is eagerly waiting for something or some one?Jenny goes indoors again, and Ruby can hear the clatter of plates and
cups echoing across the quadrangle as she makes ready the early tea.The child’s eyes are dim with the glare at which she has so long been
gazing, and her limbs, in their cramped position, are aching; but Ruby
hardly seems to feel the discomfort from which those useful members
suffer.She goes in to tea with a grudge, listens to her stepmother’s
fretful little complaints with an absent air which shows how far away
her heart is, and returns as soon as she may to her point of vantage.“Oh, me!” sighs the poor little girl.“Will he never come?”

Out in the west the red sun is dying grandly in an amber sky, tinged
with the glory of his life-blood, when dad at length comes riding home.Ruby has seen him far in the distance, and runs out past the gate to
meet him.“Oh, dad darling!” she cries.“I did think you were never coming.Oh,
dad, are you hurt?” her quick eyes catching sight of his hand in a
sling.“Only a scratch, little girl,” he says.“Don’t
frighten the mother about it.Poor little Ruby red, were you
frightened?Did you think your old father was to be killed outright?”

“I didn’t know,” Ruby says.“And mamma was
frightened too.And when even Dick didn’t come back.Oh, dad, wasn’t it
just dreadful--the fire, I mean?”

Black Prince has been put into the paddock, and Ruby goes into the
house, hanging on her father’s uninjured arm.The child’s heart has
grown suddenly light.The terrible fear which has been weighing her
down for the last few hours has been lifted, and Ruby is her old joyous
self again.“Dad,” the little girl says later on.They are sitting out on the
verandah, enjoying the comparative cool of the evening.“What will
he do, old Davis, I mean, now that his house is burnt down?It won’t
hardly be worth while his building another, now that he’s so old.”

Dad does not answer just for a moment, and Ruby, glancing quickly
upwards, almost fancies that her father must be angry with her; his
face is so very grave.Perhaps he does not even wish her to mention the
name of the old man, who, but that he is “so old,” should now have been
in prison.“Old Davis will never need another house now, Ruby,” Dad answers,
looking down into the eager little upturned face.God has taken him away, dear.”

“He’s dead?” Ruby questions with wide-open, horror-stricken eyes.The little girl hardly hears her father as he goes on to tell her how
the old man’s end came, suddenly and without warning, crushing him in
the ruins of his burning cottage, where the desolate creature died
as he had lived, uncared for and alone.Into Ruby’s heart a great,
sorrowful regret has come, regret for a kind act left for ever undone,
a kind word for ever unspoken.“And I can never do it now!” the child sobs.“He’ll never even know I
wanted to be kind to him!”

“Kind to whom, little girl?” her father asks wonderingly.And it is in those kind arms that Ruby sobs out her story.“I can never
do it now!” that is the burden of her sorrow.The late Australian twilight gathers round them, and the stars twinkle
out one by one.But, far away in the heaven which is beyond the stars
and the dim twilight of this world, I think that God knows how one
little girl, whose eyes are now dim with tears, tried to be “kind,”
and it may be that in His own good time--and God’s time is always the
best--He will let old Davis “know” also.[Illustration]




CHAPTER VII.“There came a glorious morning, such a one
  As dawns but once a season.Mercury
  On such a morning would have flung himself
  From cloud to cloud, and swum with balanced wings
  To some tall mountain: when I said to her,
  ‘A day for gods to stoop,’ she answered ‘Ay,
  And men to soar.’”

                                          TENNYSON.Ruby goes about her work and play very gravely for the next few days.A great sorrow sits at her heart which only time can lighten and chase
away.She is very lonely, this little girl--lonely without even knowing
it, but none the less to be pitied on that account.To her step-mother
Ruby never even dreams of turning for comfort or advice in her small
troubles and griefs.Dad is his little girl’s _confidant_; but, then,
dad is often away, and in Mrs.Thorne’s presence Ruby never thinks of
confiding in her father.It is a hot sunny morning in the early months of the new year.Ruby is
riding by her father’s side along the river’s bank, Black Prince doing
his very best to accommodate his long steps to Smuttie’s slower amble.Far over the long flats of uncultivated bush-land hangs a soft blue
haze, forerunner of a day of intense heat.But Ruby and dad are early
astir this morning, and it is still cool and fresh with the beautiful
young freshness of a glorious summer morning.“It’s lovely just now,” Ruby says, with a little sigh of satisfaction.“I wish it would always stay early morning; don’t you, dad?It’s like
where it says in the hymn about ‘the summer morn I’ve sighed for.’
P’raps that means that it will always be morning in heaven.I hope it
will.”

“It will be a very fair summer morn anyway, little girl,” says dad, a
sudden far-away look coming into his brown eyes.At the child’s words, his thoughts have gone back with a sudden rush of
memory to another summer’s morning, long, long ago, when he knelt by
the bedside where his young wife lay gasping out her life, and watched
Ruby’s mother go home to God.“I’ll be waiting for you, Will,” she had
whispered only a little while before she went away.“It won’t be so
very long, my darling; for even heaven won’t be quite heaven to me with
you away.” And as the dawning rose over the purple hill-tops, and the
birds’ soft twitter-twitter gave glad greeting to the new-born day, the
angels had come for Ruby’s mother, and the dawning for her had been the
glorious dawning of heaven.Many a year has passed away since then, sorrowfully enough at first for
the desolate husband, all unheeded by the child, who never missed her
mother because she never knew her.Nowadays new hopes, new interests
have come to Will Thorne, dimming with their fresher links the dear old
days of long ago.He has not forgotten the love of his youth, never
will; but time has softened the bitterness of his sorrow, and caused
him to think but with a gentle regret of the woman whom God had called
away in the suntime of her youth.But Ruby’s words have come to him
this summer morning awakening old memories long slumbering, and his
thoughts wander from the dear old days, up--up--up to God’s land on
high, where, in the fair summer morning of Paradise, one is waiting
longingly, hopefully--one who, even up in heaven, will be bitterly
disappointed if those who in the old days she loved more than life
itself will not one day join her there.“Dad,” Ruby asks quickly, uplifting a troubled little face to that
other dear one above her, “what is the matter?You looked so sorry, so
very sorry, just now,” adds the little girl, with something almost like
a sob.Did I?” says the father, with a swift sudden smile.He bends
down to the little figure riding by his side, and strokes the soft,
brown hair.“I was thinking of your mother, Ruby,” dad says.“But
instead of looking sorry I should have looked glad, that for her all
tears are for ever past, and that nothing can ever harm her now.I was
thinking of her at heaven’s gate, darling, watching, as she said she
would, for you and for me.”

“I wonder,” says Ruby, with very thoughtful brown eyes, “how will I
know her?God will have to tell her,
won’t He?And p’raps I’ll be quite grown up ’fore I die, and mother
won’t think it’s her own little Ruby at all.I wish I knew,” adds the
child, in a puzzled voice.“God will make it all right, dear.I have no fear of that,” says the
father, quickly.It is not often that Ruby and he talk as they are doing now.Like all
true Scotchmen, he is reticent by nature, reverencing that which is
holy too much to take it lightly upon his lips.As for Ruby, she has
never even thought of such things.In her gay, sunny life she has had
no time to think of the mother awaiting her coming in the land which
to Ruby, in more senses than one, is “very far off.”

Far in the distance the early sunshine gleams on the river, winding out
and in like a silver thread.The tall trees stand stiffly by its banks,
their green leaves faintly rustling in the soft summer wind.And above
all stretches the blue, blue sky, flecked here and there by a fleecy
cloud, beyond which, as the children tell us, lies God’s happiest land.It is a fair scene, and one which Ruby’s eyes have gazed on often,
with but little thought or appreciation of its beauty.But to-day her
thoughts are far away, beyond another river which all must pass, where
the shadows only fall the deeper because of the exceeding brightness
of the light beyond.And still another river rises before the little
girl’s eyes, a river, clear as crystal, the “beautiful, beautiful
river” by whose banks the pilgrimage of even the most weary shall one
day cease, the burden of even the most heavy-laden, one day be laid
down.On what beauties must not her mother’s eyes be now gazing!But
even midst the joy and glory of the heavenly land, how can that fond,
loving heart be quite content if Ruby, one far day, is not to be with
her there?All the way home the little girl is very thoughtful, and a strange
quietness seems to hang over usually merry Ruby for the remainder of
the day.But towards evening a great surprise is in store for her.Dick, whose
duty it is, when his master is otherwise engaged, to ride to the
nearest post-town for the letters, arrives with a parcel in his bag,
addressed in very big letters to “Miss Ruby Thorne.” With fingers
trembling with excitement the child cuts the string.Within is a long
white box, and within the box a doll more beautiful than Ruby has ever
even imagined, a doll with golden curls and closed eyes, who, when
set upright, discloses the bluest of blue orbs.She is dressed in the
daintiest of pale blue silk frocks, and tiny bronze shoes encase her
feet.She is altogether, as Ruby ecstatically exclaims, “a love of a
doll,” and seems but little the worse for her long journey across the
briny ocean.“It’s from Jack!” cries Ruby, her eyes shining.“Oh, and here’s a
letter pinned to dolly’s dress!What a nice writer he is!” The child’s
cheeks flush redly, and her fingers tremble even more as she tears the
envelope open.“I’ll read it first to myself, mamma, and then I’ll give
it to you.”

    “MY DEAR LITTLE RUBY” (so the letter runs),

    “I have very often thought of you since last we parted, and now do
    myself the pleasure of sending madam across the sea in charge of
    my letter to you.She is the little bird I would ask to whisper
    of me to you now and again, and if you remember your old friend
    as well as he will always remember you, I shall ask no more.How
    are the dollies?Bluebell and her other ladyship--I have forgotten
    her name.I often think of you this bleak, cold weather, and envy
    you your Australian sunshine just as, I suppose, you often envy
    me my bonnie Scotland.I am looking forward to the day when you
    are coming home on that visit you spoke of.We must try and have
    a regular jollification then, and Edinburgh, your mother’s home,
    isn’t so far off from Greenock but that you can manage to spend
    some time with us.My mother bids me say that she will expect you
    and your people.Give my kindest regards to your father and mother,
    and, looking forward to next Christmas,

                          “I remain, my dear little Ruby red,
                                                “Your old friend,
                                                             “JACK.”

“Very good of him to take so much trouble on a little girl’s account,”
remarks Mrs.Thorne, approvingly, when she too has perused the letter.It is the least you can do, after his kindness, and I am
sure he would like to have a letter from you.”

“I just love him,” says Ruby, squeezing her doll closer to her.“I wish
I could call the doll after him; but then, ‘Jack’ would never do for
a lady’s name.I know what I’ll do!” with a little dance of delight.“I’ll call her ‘May’ after the little girl who gave Jack the card, and
I’ll call her ‘Kirke’ for her second name, and that’ll be after Jack.I’ll tell him that when I write, and I’d better send him back his card
too.”

That very evening, Ruby sits down to laboriously compose a letter to
her friend.“MY DEAR JACK” (writes Ruby in her large round hand),

[“I don’t know what else to say,” murmurs the little girl, pausing with
her pen uplifted.“I never wrote a letter before.”

“Thank him for the doll, of course,” advises Mrs.Thorne, with an
amused smile.“That is the reason for your writing to him at all, Ruby.”

So Ruby, thus adjured, proceeds--]

    “Thank you very much for the doll.I am calling her ‘May Kirke,’ after the name on your card, and
    after your own name; because I couldn’t call her ‘Jack.’ We are
    having very hot weather yet; but not so hot as when you were here.The dolls are not quite well, because Fanny fell under old Hans’
    waggon, and the waggon went over her face and squashed it.I am
    very sorry, because I liked her, but your doll will make up.Thank
    you for writing me.Mamma says I am to send her kindest regards to
    you.It won’t be long till next Christmas now.I am sending you
    back your card.“With love, from your little friend,
                                                               “RUBY.“P.S.--Dad has come in now, and asks me to remember him to you.I
    have had to write this all over again; mamma said it was so badly
    spelt.”

Jack Kirke’s eyes soften as he reads the badly written little letter,
and it is noticeable that when he reaches a certain point where two
words, “May Kirke,” appear, he stops and kisses the paper on which they
are written.Such are the excessively foolish antics of young men who happen to be
in love.[Illustration]

CHAPTER VIII.“The Christmas bells from hill to hill
  Answer each other in the mist.”

                               TENNYSON.Christmas Day again; but a white, white Christmas this time--a
Christmas Day in bonnie Scotland.In the sitting-room of an old-fashioned house in Edinburgh a little
brown-haired, brown-eyed girl is dancing about in an immense state
of excitement.She is a merry-looking little creature, with rosy
cheeks, and wears a scarlet frock, which sets off those same cheeks to
perfection.“Can’t you be still even for a moment, Ruby?”

“No, I can’t,” the child returns.“And neither could you, Aunt Lena,
if you knew my dear Jack.Oh, he’s just a dear!I wonder what’s keeping
him?What if he’s just gone on straight home to Greenock without
stopping here at all.what if there’s been a collision.Dad says there are quite often collisions in Scotland!” cries Ruby,
suddenly growing very grave.“What if the skies were to fall?Just about as probable, you wild
little Australian,” laughs the lady addressed as Aunt Lena, who bears
sufficient resemblance to the present Mrs.Thorne to proclaim them
to be sisters.“You must expect trains to be late at Christmas time,
Ruby.But of course you can’t be expected to know that, living in the
Australian bush all your days.Poor, dear Dolly, I wonder how she ever
survived it.”

“Mamma was very often ill,” Ruby returns very gravely.“She didn’t
like being out there at all, compared with Scotland.‘Bonnie Scotland’
Jenny always used to call it.But I do think,” adds the child, with
a small sigh and shiver as she glances out at the fast-falling snow,
“that Glengarry’s bonnier.There are so many houses here, and you can’t
see the river unless you go away up above them all.P’raps though in
summer,” with a sudden regret that she has possibly said something
not just quite polite.“And then when grandma and you are always used
to it.It’s different with me; I’ve been always used to Glengarry.Oh,” cries Ruby, with a sudden, glad little cry, and dash to the
front door, “here he is at last!Oh, Jack, Jack!” Aunt Lena can hear
the shrill childish voice exclaiming.“I thought you were just never
coming.I thought p’raps there had been a collision.” And presently
the dining-room door is flung open, and Ruby, now in a high state of
excitement, ushers in her friend.Miss Lena Templeton’s first feeling is one of surprise, almost of
disappointment, as she rises to greet the new-comer.The “Jack” Ruby
had talked of in such ecstatic terms had presented himself before the
lady’s mind’s eye as a tall, broad-shouldered, handsome man, the sort
of man likely to take a child’s fancy; ay, and a woman’s too.But the real Jack is insignificant in the extreme.At such a man one
would not bestow more than a passing glance.So thinks Miss Templeton
as her hand is taken in the young Scotchman’s strong grasp.His face,
now that the becoming bronze of travel has left it, is colourlessly
pale, his merely medium height lessened by his slightly stooping form.It is his eyes which suddenly and irresistibly
fascinate Miss Lena, seeming to look her through and through, and when
Jack smiles, this young lady who has turned more than one kneeling
suitor from her feet with a coldly-spoken “no,” ceases to wonder how
even the child has been fascinated by the wonderful personality of
this plain-faced man.“I am very glad to make your acquaintance, Miss Templeton,” Jack Kirke
says.“It is good of you to receive me for Ruby’s sake.” He glances
down at the child with one of his swift, bright smiles, and squeezes
tighter the little hand which so confidingly clasps his.“I’ve told Aunt Lena all about you, Jack,” Ruby proclaims in her shrill
sweet voice.“She said she was quite anxious to see you after all I had
said.Jack, can’t you stay Christmas with us?It would be lovely if
you could.”

“We shall be very glad if you can make it convenient to stay and eat
your Christmas dinner with us, Mr.Kirke,” Miss Templeton says.“In
such weather as this, you have every excuse for postponing your journey
to Greenock for a little.”

“Many thanks for your kindness, Miss Templeton,” the young man
responds.“I should have been most happy, but that I am due at Greenock
this afternoon at my mother’s.She is foolish enough to set great store
by her unworthy son, and I couldn’t let her have the dismal cheer
of eating her Christmas dinner all alone.Two years ago,” the young
fellow’s voice softens as he speaks, “there were two of us.Nowadays
I must be more to my mother than I ever was, to make up for Wat.He
was my only brother”--all the agony of loss contained in that “was” no
one but Jack Kirke himself will ever know--“and it is little more than
a year now since he died.My poor mother, I don’t know how I had the
heart to leave her alone last Christmas as I did; but I think I was
nearly out of my mind at the time.Anyway I must try to make it up to
her this year, if I possibly can.”

“Was Wat like you?” Ruby asks very softly.She has climbed on her
long-lost friend’s knee, a habit Ruby has not yet grown big enough to
be ashamed of, and sits, gazing up into those other brown eyes.“I wish
I’d known him too,” Ruby says.“A thousand times better,” Wat’s brother returns with decision.“He was
the kindest fellow that ever lived, I think, though it seems queer to
be praising up one’s own brother.If you had known Wat, Ruby, I would
have been nowhere, and glad to be nowhere, alongside of such a fellow
as him.Folks said we were like in a way, to look at; though it was a
poor compliment to Wat to say so; but there the resemblance ended.This
is his photograph,” rummaging his pocket-book--“no, not that one, old
lady,” a trifle hurriedly, as one falls to the ground.“Mayn’t I see it, Jack?” she
petitions.Jack Kirke grows rather red and looks a trifle foolish; but it is
impossible to refuse the child’s request.Had Ruby’s aunt not been
present, it is possible that he might not have minded quite so much.“I like her face,” Ruby determines.“It’s a nice face.”

It is a nice face, this on the photograph, as the child has said.The
face of a girl just stepping into womanhood, fair and sweet, though
perhaps a trifle dreamy, but with that shining in the eyes which tells
how to their owner belongs a gift which but few understand, and which,
for lack of a better name, the world terms “Imagination.” For those
who possess it there will ever be an added glory in the sunset, a
softly-whispered story in each strain of soon-to-be-forgotten music,
a reflection of God’s radiance upon the very meanest things of this
earth.A gift which through all life will make for them all joy
keener, all sorrow bitterer, and which they only who have it can fully
comprehend and understand.“And this is Wat,” goes on Jack, thus effectually silencing the
question which he sees hovering on Ruby’s lips.“I like him, too,” Ruby cries, with shining eyes.“Look, Aunt Lena,
isn’t he nice?Doesn’t he look nice and kind?”

There is just the faintest resemblance to the living brother in the
pictured face upon the card, for in his day Walter Kirke must indeed
have been a handsome man.But about the whole face a tinge of sadness
rests.In the far-away land of heaven God has wiped away all tears for
ever from the eyes of Jack’s brother.In His likeness Walter Kirke has
awakened, and is satisfied for ever.Kirke?” says Ruby’s mother, fluttering into the
room.Thorne is a very different woman from the languid
invalid of the Glengarry days.The excitement and bustle of town life
have done much to bring back her accustomed spirits, and she looks more
like pretty Dolly Templeton of the old days than she has done since
her marriage.We have been out calling on a few
friends, and got detained.Isn’t it a regular Christmas day?I hope
that you will be able to spend some time with us, now that you are
here.”

“I have just been telling Miss Templeton that I have promised to eat
my Christmas dinner in Greenock,” Jack Kirke returns, with a smile.“Business took me north, or I shouldn’t have been away from home in
such weather as this, and I thought it would be a good plan to break my
journey in Edinburgh, and see how my Australian friends were getting
on.My mother intends writing you herself; but she bids me say that
if you can spare a few days for us in Greenock, we shall be more than
pleased.I rather suspect, Ruby, that she has heard so much of you,
that she is desirous of making your acquaintance on her own account,
and discovering what sort of young lady it is who has taken her son’s
heart so completely by storm.”

“Oh, and, Jack,” cries Ruby, “I’ve got May with me.I thought it would be nice to let her see bonnie Scotland again,
seeing she came from it, just as I did when I was ever so little.Can’t
I bring her to Greenock when I come?Because, seeing she is called
after you, she ought really and truly to come and visit you.Oughtn’t
she?” questions Ruby, looking up into the face of May’s donor with very
wide brown eyes.“Of course,” Jack returns gravely.“It would never do to leave May
behind in Edinburgh.” He lingers over the name almost lovingly; but
Ruby does not notice that then.“Dad,” Ruby cries as her father comes into the room, “do you know what?We’re all to go to Greenock to stay with Jack.Isn’t it lovely?”

“Not very flattering to us that you are in such a hurry to get away
from us, Ruby,” observes Miss Templeton, with a slight smile.“Whatever else you have accomplished, Mr.Kirke, you seem to have
stolen one young lady’s heart at least away.”

“I like him,” murmurs Ruby, stroking Jack’s hair in rather a babyish
way she has.“I wouldn’t like never to go back to Glengarry, because I
like Glengarry; but _I should_ like to stay always in Scotland because
Jack’s here.”

CHAPTER IX.“As the stars for ever and ever.”


“Jack,” Ruby says very soberly, “I want you to do something for me.”

Crowning joy has come at last to Ruby.Kirke’s expected letter,
backed by another from her son, has come, inviting the Thornes to spend
the first week of the New Year with them.And now Ruby’s parents have
departed to pay some flying visits farther north, leaving their little
girl, at Mrs.Kirke’s urgent request, to await their return in Greenock.“For Jack’s sake I should be so glad if you could allow her,” Jack’s
mother had said.“It makes everything so bright to have a child’s
presence in the house, and Jack and I have been sad enough since Walter
died.”

Sad enough!Few but Jack could have told
how sad.“Fire away, little Ruby red,” is Jack’s rejoinder.They are in the smoking-room, Jack stretched in one easy chair, Ruby
curled up in another.Jack has been away in dreamland, following with
his eyes the blue wreaths of smoke floating upwards from his pipe to
the roof; but now he comes back to real life--and Ruby.“This is it,” Ruby explains.“You know the day we went down to
Inverkip, dad and I?Well, we went to see mamma’s grave--my own mamma,
I mean.Dad gave me a shilling before he went away, and I thought
I should like to buy some flowers and put them there.It looked so
lonely, and as if everybody had forgotten all about her being buried
there.And she was my own mamma,” adds the little girl, a world of
pathos in her young voice.“So there’s nobody but me to do it.So,
Jack, would you mind?”

“Taking you?” exclaims the young man.“Of course I will, old lady.It’ll be a jolly little excursion, just you and I together.No, not
exactly jolly,” remembering the intent of their journey, “but very
nice.We’ll go to-morrow, Ruby.Luckily the yard’s having holidays just
now, so I can do as I like.As for the flowers, don’t you bother about
them.I’ll get plenty for you to do as you like with.”

“Oh, you are good!” cries the little girl, rising and throwing her arms
round the young man’s neck.“I wish you weren’t so old, Jack, and I’d
marry you when I grew up.”

“But I’m desperately old,” says Jack, showing all his pretty, even,
white teeth in a smile.“Twenty-six if I’m a day.I shall be quite an
old fogey when you’re a nice young lady, Ruby red.Thank you all the
same for the honour,” says Jack, twirling his moustache and smiling to
himself a little.“But you’ll find some nice young squatter in the days
to come who’ll have two words to say to such an arrangement.”

“I won’t ever like anybody so well as you, anyway,” decides Ruby,
resolutely.In the days to come Jack often laughingly recalls this
asseveration to her.“And I don’t think I’ll ever get married.I
wouldn’t like to leave dad.”

The following day sees a young man and a child passing through the
quaint little village of Inverkip, lying about six miles away from the
busy seaport of Greenock, on their way to the quiet churchyard which
encircles the little parish kirk.As Ruby has said, it looks painfully
lonely this winter afternoon, none the less so that the rain and thaw
have come and swept before them the snow, save where it lies in
discoloured patches here and there about the churchyard wall.“I know it by the tombstone,” observes Ruby, cheerfully, as they close
the gates behind them.“It’s a grey tombstone, and mamma’s name below
a lot of others.This is it, I think,” adds the child, pausing before
a rather desolate-looking grey slab.“Yes, there’s her name at the
foot, ‘Janet Stuart,’ and dad says that was her favourite text that’s
underneath--‘Surely I come quickly.Even so come, Lord Jesus.’
I’ll put down the flowers.I wonder,” says Ruby, looking up into Jack’s
face with a sudden glad wonder on her own, “if mamma can look down from
heaven, and see you and me here, and be glad that somebody’s putting
flowers on her grave at last.”

“She will have other things to be glad about, I think, little Ruby,”
Jack Kirke says very gently.“But she will be glad, I am sure, if she
sees us--and I think she does,” the young man adds reverently--“that
through all those years her little girl has not forgotten her.”

“But I don’t remember her,” says Ruby, looking up with puzzled eyes.“Only dad says that before she died she said that he was to tell me
that she would be waiting for me, and that she had prayed the Lord
Jesus that I might be one of His jewels.I’m not!” cries
Ruby, with a little choke in her voice.“And if I’m not, the Lord Jesus
will never gather me, and I’ll never see my mamma again.Even up in
heaven she might p’raps feel sorry if some day I wasn’t there too.”

“I know,” Jack says quickly.He puts his arm about the little girl’s
shoulders, and his own heart goes out in a great leap to this child who
is wondering, as he himself not so very long ago, in a strange mazed
way, wondered too, if even ’midst heaven’s glories another will “feel
sorry” because those left behind will not one far day join them there.“I felt that too,” the young man goes on quietly.“But it’s all right
now, dear little Ruby red.Everything seemed so dark when Wat died,
and I cried out in my misery that the God who could let such things be
was no God for me.But bit by bit, after a terrible time of doubt, the
mists lifted, and God seemed to let me know that He had done the very
best possible for Wat in taking him away, though I couldn’t understand
just yet why.The one thing left for me to do now was to make quite
sure that one day I should meet Wat again, and I couldn’t rest till
I made sure of that.It’s so simple, Ruby, just to believe in the
dear Lord Jesus, so simple, that when at last I found out about it, I
wondered how I could have doubted so long.I can’t speak about such
things,” the young fellow adds huskily, “but I felt that if you feel
about your mother as I did about Wat, that I must help you.Don’t you
see, dear, just to trust in Christ with all your heart that He is able
to save you, and He _will_.It was only for Wat’s sake that I tried to
love Him first; but now I love Him for His own.”

It has cost Ruby’s friend more than the child knows to make even this
simple confession of his faith.But I think that in heaven’s morning
Jack’s crown will be all the brighter for the words he spoke to a
doubting little girl on a never-to-be-forgotten winter’s day.For it is
said that even those who but give to drink of a cup of cold water for
the dear Christ’s sake shall in no wise lose their reward.“I love you, Jack,” is all Ruby says, with a squeeze of her friend’s
hand.“And if I do see mamma in heaven some day, I’ll tell her how
good you’ve been to me.Jack, won’t it be nice if we’re all there
together, Wat and you, and dad and mamma and me?”

Jack does not answer just for a moment.The young fellow’s heart has
gone out with one of those sudden agonizing rushes of longing to the
brother whom he has loved, ay, and still loves, more than life itself.It _must_ be better for Wat--of that Jack with all his loyal heart
feels sure; but oh, how desolately empty is the world to the brother
Jack left behind!One far day God will let they two meet again;
that too Jack knows; but oh, for one hour of the dear old here and
now!In the golden streets of the new Jerusalem Jack will look into
the sorrowless eyes of one whom God has placed for ever above all
trouble, sorrow, and pain; but the lad’s heart cries out with a fierce
yearning for no glorified spirit with crown-decked brow, but the dear
old Wat with the leal home love shining out of his eyes, and the warm
hand-clasp of brotherly affection.Fairer than all earthly music the
song of the redeemed may ring throughout the courts of heaven; but
sweeter far in those fond ears will sound the well-loved tones which
Jack Kirke has known since he was a child.“Yes, dear,” Jack says, with a swift, sudden smile for the eager little
face uplifted to his, “it _will_ be nice.So we must make sure that we
won’t disappoint them, mustn’t we?”

Another face than Ruby’s uprises before the young man’s eyes as he
speaks, the face of the brother whose going had made all the difference
to Jack’s life; but who, up in heaven, had brought him nearer to God
than he ever could have done on earth.Not a dead face, as Jack had
looked his last upon it, but bright and loving as in the dear old days
when the world seemed made for those two, who dreamed such great things
of the wonderful “may be” to come.But now God has raised Wat higher
than even his airy castles have ever reached--to heaven itself, and
brought Jack, by the agony of loss, very near unto Himself.No, Jack
determines, he must make sure that he will never disappoint Wat.The red sun, like a ball of fire, is setting behind the dark, leafless
tree-tops when at last they turn to go, and everything is very still,
save for the faint ripple of the burn through the long flats of field
as it flows out to meet the sea.Fast clasped in Jack’s is Ruby’s
little hand; but a stronger arm than his is guiding both Jack and
Ruby onward.In the dawning, neither Wat nor Ruby’s mother need fear
disappointment now.“I’m glad I came,” says Ruby in a very quiet little voice as the train
goes whizzing home.“There was nobody to come but me, you see, me and
dad, for dad says that mamma had no relations when he married her.They
were all dead, and she had to be a governess to keep herself.Dad says
that he never saw any one so brave as my own mamma was.”

“See and grow up like her, then, little Ruby,” Jack says with one of
his bright, kindly smiles.“It’s the best sight in the world to see a
brave woman; at least _I_ think so,” adds the young man, smiling down
into the big brown eyes looking up into his.He can hardly help marvelling, even to himself, at the situation in
which he now finds himself.How Wat would have laughed in the old
days at the idea of Jack ever troubling himself with a child, Jack,
who had been best known, if not exactly as a child-hater, at least as
a child-avoider.Is it Wat’s mantle
dropped from the skies, the memory of that elder brother’s kindly
heart, which has softened the younger’s, and made him “kind,” as Ruby
one long gone day had tried to be, to all whom he comes in contact
with?For Wat’s sake Jack had first tried to do right; ay, but now it
is for a greater than that dear brother’s, even for Christ’s.Valiant-for-Truth of old renown, Wat has left as sword the legacy of
his great and beautiful charity to the young brother who is to succeed
him in the pilgrimage.“Jack,” Ruby whispers that evening as she kisses her friend good night,
“I’m going to try--you know.I don’t want to disappoint mamma.”

Up in heaven I wonder if the angels were glad that night.There is an old, old verse ringing in my ears, none the
less true that he who spoke it in the far away days has long since gone
home to God: “And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of
the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars
for ever and ever.”

Surely, in the dawning of that “summer morn” Jack’s crown will not be a
starless one.[Illustration]

CHAPTER X.

MAY.“For God above
    Is great to grant, as mighty to make,
  And creates the love to reward the love:
    I claim you still for my own love’s sake!”

                                     BROWNING.Ruby comes into the drawing-room one afternoon to find the facsimile of
the photograph in Jack’s pocket-book sitting with Mrs.“This is our little Australian, May,” the elder lady says, stretching
out her hand to Ruby.“Ruby, darling, this is Miss Leslie.Perhaps Jack
may have told you about her.”

“How do you do, dear?” Miss May Leslie asks.She has a sweet, clear
voice, and just now does not look half so dreamy as in her photograph,
Ruby thinks.Her dark green frock and black velvet hat with ostrich
tips set off her fair hair and delicately tinted face to perfection,
and her blue eyes are shining as she holds out her hand to the little
girl.“I’ve seen your photograph,” Ruby announces, looking up into the sweet
face above her.“It fell out of Jack’s pocket-book one day.He has it
there with Wat’s.I’m going to give him mine to carry there too; for
Jack says he only keeps the people he likes best in it.”

Miss Leslie grows suddenly, and to Ruby it seems unaccountably, as red
as her own red frock.But for all that the little girl cannot help
thinking that she does not look altogether ill-pleased.Kirke
smiles in rather an embarrassed way.“Have you been long in Scotland, Ruby?” the young lady questions, as
though desirous of changing the subject.“We came about the beginning of December,” Ruby returns.And then she
too puts rather an irrelevant question: “Are you May?”

“Well, yes, I suppose I am May,” Miss Leslie answers, laughing in spite
of herself.“But how did you know my name, Ruby?”

“Jack told her, I suppose.Was that it, Ruby?” says Jack’s mother.“And
this is a child, May, who, when she is told a thing, never forgets it.Isn’t that so, little girlie?”

“No, but Jack didn’t tell me,” Ruby answers, lifting wide eyes to her
hostess.“I just guessed that you must be May whenever I came in, and
then I heard auntie call you it.” For at Mrs.Kirke’s own request,
the little girl has conferred upon her this familiar title.“I’ve got
a dolly called after you,” goes on the child with sweet candour.“May
Kirke’s her name, and Jack says it’s the prettiest name he ever heard,
‘May Kirke,’ I mean.For you see the dolly came from Jack, and when I
could only call her half after him, I called her the other half after
you.”

“But, my dear little girl, how did you know my name?” May asks in some
amazement.Her eyes are sparkling as she puts the question.No one
could accuse May Leslie of being dreamy now.“It was on the card,” Ruby announces, triumphantly.Well is it for Jack
that he is not at hand to hear all these disclosures.“Jack left it
behind him at Glengarry when he stayed a night with us, and your name
was on it.Then I knew some other little girl must have given it to
Jack.I didn’t know then that she would be big and grown-up like you.”

“Ruby!I am afraid that you are a sad little tell-tale,” Mrs.It is rather a sore point with her that this pink-and-white
girl should have slighted her only son so far as to refuse his hand
and heart.Poor Jack, he had had more sorrows to bear than Walter’s
death when he left the land of his birth at that sad time.In the fond
mother’s eyes May is not half good enough for her darling son; but
May’s offence is none the more to be condoned on that account.“I must really be going, Mrs.Kirke,” the young lady says, rising.She
cannot bear that any more of Ruby’s revelations, however welcome to
her own ears, shall be made in the presence of Jack’s mother.“I have
inflicted quite a visitation upon you as it is.You will come and see
me, darling, won’t you?” this to Ruby.Kirke if she will be
so kind as to bring you some day.”

“And I’ll bring May Kirke too,” Ruby cries.It may have been the
firelight which sends an added redness to the other May’s cheeks, as
Ruby utters the name which Jack has said is “the prettiest he has ever
heard.”

Ruby escorts her new-found friend down to the hall door, issuing from
which Miss Leslie runs full tilt against a young man coming in.“Oh, Jack,” Ruby cries, “you’re just in time!Miss May’s just going
away.I’ve forgotten her other name, so I’m just going to call her Miss
May.”

“May I see you home?” Jack Kirke asks.“It is too dark now for you to
go by yourself.” He looks straight into the eyes of the girl he has
known since she was a child, the girl who has refused his honest love
because she had no love to give in return, and May’s eyes fall beneath
his gaze.“Very well,” she acquiesces meekly.Ruby, looking out after the two as they go down the dark avenue,
pities them for having to go out on such a dismal night.The little
girl does not know that for them it is soon to be illumined with a
light than which there is none brighter save that of heaven, the truest
land of love.It is rather a silent walk home, the conversation made up of the most
common of common-places--Jack trying to steel himself against this
woman, whom, try as he will, he cannot thrust out of his loyal heart;
May tortured by that most sorrowful of all loves, the love which came
too late; than which there is none sadder in this grey old world to-day.“What a nice little girl Ruby is,” says May at length, trying to fill
up a rather pitiful gap in the conversation.“Your mother seems so fond
of her.I am sure she will miss her when she goes.”

“She’s the dearest little girl in the world,” Jack Kirke declares.His
eyes involuntarily meet May’s blue ones, and surely something which was
not there before is shining in their violet depths--“except,” he says,
then stops.“May,” very softly, “will you let me say it?”

May answers nothing; but, though she droops her head, Jack sees her
eyes are shining.They say that silence gives consent, and evidently
in this case it must have done so, or else the young man in question
chooses to translate it in that way.So the stars smile down on an
old, old story, a story as old as the old, old world, and yet new and
fresh as ever to those who for the first time scan its wondrous pages;
a story than which there is none sweeter on this side of time, the
beautiful, glamorous mystery of “love’s young dream.”

“And are you sure,” Jack asks after a time, in the curious manner
common to young lovers, “that you really love me now, May?that I
shan’t wake up to find it all a mistake as it was last time.I’m very
dense at taking it in, sweetheart; but it almost seems yet as though it
was too good to be true.”

“Quite sure,” May says.She looks up into the face of the man beside
whom all others to her are but “as shadows,” unalterable trust in her
blue eyes.“Jack,” very low, “I think I have loved you all my life.”

       *       *       *       *       *

“_I_ said I would marry you, Jack,” Ruby remarks in rather an offended
voice when she hears the news.“But I s’pose you thought I was too
little.”

“That was just it, Ruby red,” Jack tells her, and stifles further
remonstrance by a kiss.PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED
  LONDON AND BECCLES.TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES:


  Text in italics is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.To the north of the city is a group known as the
Tombs of the Kings, with a façade of a corrupt Doric order, similar to
some of the latest Etruscan tombs.[191] These are now very much ruined,
but still retain sufficient traces of the original design to fix their
date within or subsequently to the Herodian period without much
possibility of doubt.A somewhat similar façade, but of a form more like
the Greek Doric, found in the Valley of Jehoshaphat, bears the name of
the Sepulchre of St.So-called “Tomb of Zechariah.”]

Close to this is a square tomb, known as that of Zechariah, cut in the
rock, but standing free.Each face is adorned with Ionic pillars and
square piers at the angles, the whole being crowned with a pyramidal
roof.Perhaps this building should properly be called a cenotaph, as it
is perfectly solid, and no cave or sepulchral vault has been found
beneath it, though judging from analogies one might yet be found if
properly looked for.A tomb with an architectural façade, similar to
that of the so-called Tomb of the Judges, does exist behind it cut in
rock, and is consequently of more modern construction.It may be to mark
this that the architectural monolith was left.Close to this is another identical with it in as far as the basement is
concerned, and which is now popularly known as the Tomb of Absalom; but
in this instance the pyramid has been replaced with a structural spire,
and it is probable when this was done that the chamber which now exists
in its interior was excavated.The so-called Tomb of Absalom.]One of the remarkable points in these tombs is the curious jumble of the
Roman orders which they present.The pillars and pilasters are Ionic,
the architraves and frieze Doric, and the cornice Egyptian.The capitals
and frieze are so distinctly late Roman, that we can feel no hesitation
as to their date being either of the age of Herod or subsequent to that
time.In an architectural point of view the cornice is too plain to be
pleasing if not painted; it probably therefore was so treated.Another class of these tombs is represented by the so-called Tomb of the
Judges (Woodcut No.These are ornamented by a tympanum of a Greek
or Roman temple filled with a scroll-work of rich but debased pattern,
and is evidently derived from something similar, though Grecian in
design.In age it is certainly more recent than the so-called Tomb of
Zechariah, as one of precisely similar design is found cut into the face
of the rock out of which that monument was excavated.Façade of the Tomb of the Judges.]The third group is that of Cyrene, on the African coast.Notwithstanding
the researches of Admiral Beechey and of M. Pacho,[192] and the still
more recent explorations of Messrs.Smith and Porcher, above referred to
(p.285), they are still much less perfectly known to us than they
should be.Their number is immense, and they almost all have
architectural façades, generally consisting of two or more columns
between pilasters, like the grottoes of Beni-Hasan, or the Tomb of St.Many of them show powerful evidence of Greek taste,
while some may be as old as the Grecian era, though the greater part are
undoubtedly of Roman date, and the paintings with which many of them are
still adorned are certainly Roman in design.Two of them are illustrated
by Woodcuts Nos.165 and 166: one as showing more distinct evidence of
Greek taste and colour than is to be found elsewhere, though it is
doubtful if it belongs to the Grecian period any more than the so-called
Tomb of St.James at Jerusalem; the other, though of equally uncertain
date, is interesting as being a circular monument built over a cave like
that at Amrith (Woodcut No.122), and is the only other example now
known.None of them have such splendid architectural façades as the
Khasné at Petra; but the number of tombs which are adorned with
architectural features is greater than in that city, and, grouped as
they are together in terraces on the hill-side, they constitute a
necropolis which is among the most striking of the ancient world.Altogether this group, though somewhat resembling that at Castel d’Asso,
is more extensive and far richer in external architecture.[193]


Time has not left us any perfect structural tombs in all these places,
though there can be little doubt but they were once numerous.Almost the
only tomb of this class constructed in masonry known to exist, and which
in many respects is perhaps the most interesting of all, is found in
Asia Minor, at Mylassa in Caria.In form it is something like the
free-standing rock-cut examples at Jerusalem.As shown in the woodcut
(No.242), it consists of a square base, which supports twelve columns,
of which the eight inner ones support a dome, the outer four merely
completing the square.The dome itself is constructed in the same manner
as all the Jaina domes are in India (as will be explained hereafter when
describing that style), and, though ornamented with Roman details, is so
unlike anything else ever built by that people, and is so completely and
perfectly what we find reappearing ten centuries afterwards in the far
East, that we are forced to conclude that it belongs to a style once
prevalent and long fixed in these lands, though this one now stands as
the sole remaining representative of its class.(From ‘Antiquities of Ionia,’
published by the Dilettanti Society.)]Another example, somewhat similar in style, though remotely distant in
locality, is found at Dugga, near Tunis, in Africa.This, too, consists
of a square base, taller than in the last example, surmounted by twelve
Ionic columns, which are here merely used as ornaments.There were
probably square pilasters at the angles, like that at Jerusalem
(Woodcuts Nos.238, 239), while the Egyptian form of the cornice is
similar to that found in these examples, though with the omission of the
Doric frieze.It apparently originally terminated in a pyramid of steps like the
Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, and a large number of structural tombs which
copied that celebrated model.Nothing of this now remains but the four
corner-stones, which were architecturally most essential to accentuate
the weak lines of a sloping pyramid in such a situation.Taken
altogether, perhaps no more graceful monument of its class has come down
to our days than this must have been when complete.Besides these there are in Algeria two tombs of very great interest,
both from their size and the peculiarity of their forms.The best known
is that on the coast a short distance from Algiers to the westward.It
is generally known as the Kubr Roumeïa, or Tomb of the Christian
Virgin—a name it acquired from its having four false doors, each of a
single stone divided into four panels, and the stile between them
forming a cross, which has consequently been assumed to be the Christian
symbol.The building itself, which is circular, and as nearly as may be
200 ft.in diameter, stands on a square platform measuring 210 ft.The
perpendicular part is ornamented by 60 engaged columns of the Ionic
order, and by the four false doors just mentioned; above this rose a
cone—apparently in 40 steps—making the total height about 130 ft.It is,
however, so ruined that it is very difficult to feel sure about its
exact dimensions or form.Plan of the Kubr Roumeïa.(From a plate in Blakesley’s ‘Four
Months in Algeria.’)]

From objects and scribblings of various kinds found in the interior, it
appears to have remained open till nearly the time of the Moslem
conquest, but shortly afterwards to have been closed, and to have defied
all the ingenuity of explorers till a passage was forced in 1866 by
Messrs.MacCarthy and Berbrugger, acting under the orders and at the
expense of the late Emperor Napoleon III.[194] The entrance was found
passing under the sill of the false door on the east from a detached
building standing outside the platform, and which seems to have been
originally constructed to cover and protect the entrance.From this a
winding passage, 560 ft.in length, led to the central chamber where it
is assumed the royal bodies were once deposited, but when opened no
trace of them remained, nor anything to indicate who they were, nor in
what manner they were buried.The other tomb, the Madracen, is very similar to this one, but smaller.Its peristyle is of a sort of Doric order, without bases, and surmounted
by a quasi-Egyptian cornice, not unlike that on the Tomb of Absalom at
Jerusalem (Woodcut No.240), or that at Dugga (Woodcut No.Altogether its details are more elegant, and from their general
character there seems no reason for doubting that this tomb is older
than the Kubr Roumeïa, though they are so similar to each other that
their dates cannot be far distant.[195]

There seems almost no reason for doubting that the Kubr Roumeïa was the
“Monumentum commune Regiæ gentis” mentioned by Pomponius Mela,[196]
about the middle of the first century of our era, and if so, this could
only apply to the dynasty that expired with Juba II., A.D.23, and in
that case the older monument most probably belonged to the previous
dynasty, which ceased to reign with Bocchus III., 33 years before the
birth of Christ.One of the most interesting points connected with these Mauritanian
tombs is their curious similarity to that of Hadrian at Rome.The square
base, the circular colonnade, the conical roof, are all the same.At
Rome they are very much drawn out, of course, but that arose from the
“Mole” being situated among tall objects in a town, and more than even
that, perhaps, from the tendency towards height which manifested itself
so strongly in the architecture of that age.The greatest similarity, however, exists in the interior.The long
winding corridor terminating in an oblong apartment in the centre is an
identical feature in both, but has not yet been traced elsewhere, though
it can be hardly doubted that it must have existed in many other
examples.If we add to these the cenotaph at St.231), we have a
series of monuments of the same type extending over 400 years; and,
though many more are wanted before we can fill up the gaps and complete
the series, there can be little doubt that the missing links once
existed which connected them together.Beyond this we may go still
further back to the Etruscan tumuli and the simple mounds of earth on
the Tartar steppes.At the other end of the series we are evidently
approaching the verge of the towers and steeples of Christian art; and,
though it may seem the wildest of hypotheses to assert that the design
of the spire of Strasbourg grew out of the mound of Alyattes, it is
nevertheless true, and it is only non-apparent because so many of the
steps in the progress from the one to the other have disappeared in the
convulsions of the interval.We know, not only from the descriptions and incidental notices that have
come down to us, but also from the remains found at Pompeii and
elsewhere, that the private dwellings of the Romans were characterised
by that magnificence and splendour which we find in all their works,
accompanied, probably, with more than the usual amount of bad taste.In Rome itself no ancient house—indeed no trace of a domestic
edifice—exists except the palaces of the Cæsars on the Palatine Mount,
and the house of the Vestal Virgins[197] at its foot; and these even are
now a congeries of shapeless ruins, so completely destroyed as to make
it difficult even for the most imaginative of restorers to make much of
them.The extent of these ruins, however, coupled with the descriptions
that have been preserved, suffice to convince us that, of all the
palaces ever built, either in the East or the West, these were probably
the most magnificent and the most gorgeously adorned.Never in the
world’s history does it appear that so much wealth and power were at the
command of one man as was the case with the Cæsars; and never could the
world’s wealth have fallen into the hands of men more inclined to lavish
it for their own personal gratification than these emperors were.They
could, moreover, ransack the whole world for plunder to adorn their
buildings, and could command the best artists of Greece, and of all the
subject kingdoms, to assist in rendering their golden palaces the most
gorgeous that the world had then seen, or is likely soon to see again.The whole area of the palace may roughly be described as a square
platform measuring 1500 ft.east and west, with a mean breadth of 1300
ft.Owing, however, to its deeply indented
and irregular outline, it hardly covers more ground than the Baths of
Caracalla.Recent excavations have laid bare nearly the whole of the western
portion of this area, and have disclosed the plan of the building, but
all has been so completely destroyed that it requires considerable skill
and imagination to reinstate it in its previous form.The one part that
remains tolerably perfect is the so-called house of Livia the wife of
Augustus, who is said to have lived in it after the death of her
husband.In dimensions and arrangement it is not unlike the best class
of Pompeian houses, but its paintings and decorations are very superior
to anything found in that city.They are, in fact, as might be expected
from their age and position, the finest mural decorations that have come
down to us, and as they are still wonderfully perfect, they give a very
high idea of the perfection of art attained in the Augustan age, to
which they certainly belong.That part of the palace on the Palatine which most impresses the visitor
is the eastern half, which looks on one hand to the Amphitheatre, on the
other to the Baths of Caracalla, and overhangs the Circus Maximius.Though all their marble or painted decorations are gone, the enormous
masses of masonry which here exist convey that impression of grandeur
which is generally found in Roman works.It is not of Æsthetic beauty
arising from ornamental or ornamented construction, but the Technic
expression of power and greatness arising from mass and stability.It is
the same feeling with which we contemplate the aqueducts and engineering
works of this great people; and, though not of the highest class, few
scenes of architectural grandeur are more impressive than the now ruined
Palace of the Cæsars.Notwithstanding all this splendour, this palace was probably as an
architectural object inferior to the Thermæ.The thousand and one
exigencies of private life render it impossible to impart to a
residence—even to that of the world’s master—the same character of
grandeur as may be given to a building wholly devoted to show and public
purposes.In its glory the Palace of the Cæsars must have been the
world’s wonder; but as a ruin deprived of its furniture and ephemeral
splendour, it loses much that would tend to make it either pleasing or
instructive.We must not look for either beauty of proportion or
perfection of construction, or even for appropriateness of material, in
the hastily constructed halls of men whose unbounded power was only
equalled by the coarse vulgarity of their characters.The only palace of the Roman world of which sufficient remains are still
left to enable us to judge either of its extent or arrangements is that
which Diocletian built for himself at Spalato, in Dalmatia, and in which
he spent the remaining years of his life, after shaking off the cares of
Empire.It certainly gives us a most exalted idea of what the splendour
of the imperial palace at Rome must have been when we find one
emperor—certainly neither the richest nor the most powerful—building,
for his retirement, a villa in the country of almost exactly the same
dimensions as the Escurial in Spain, and consequently surpassing in
size, as it did in magnificence, most of the modern palaces of Europe.It is uncertain how far it resembles or was copied from that in Rome,
more especially as it must be regarded as a fortified palace, which
there is no reason to believe that at Rome was, while its model would
seem to have been the prætorian camp rather than any habitation built
within the protection of the city walls.In consequence of this its
exterior is plain and solid, except on the side next the sea, where it
was least liable to attack.The other three sides are only broken by the
towers that flank them, and by those that defend the great gates which
open in the centre of each face.Palace of Diocletian at Spalato.The building is nearly a regular parallelogram, though not quite so.The
south side is that facing the sea, and is 592 ft.from angle to angle;
the one opposite being only 570 in length;[198] while the east and west
sides measure each 698 ft., the whole building thus covering about 9½
English acres.The principal entrance to the palace is on the north, and is called the
Golden Gate, and, as represented in the annexed woodcut (No.247), shows
all the peculiarities of Roman architecture in its last stage.The
horizontal architrave still remains over the doorway, a useless
ornament, under a bold discharging arch, which usurps its place and does
its duty.Above this, a row of Corinthian columns, standing on brackets,
once supported the archivolts of a range of niches—a piece of pleasing
decoration, it must be confessed, but one in which the original purpose
of the column has been entirely overlooked or forgotten.Entering this portal, we pass along a street ornamented with arcades on
either side, till exactly in the centre of the building this is crossed
at right angles by another similar street, proceeding from the so-called
Iron and Brazen Gates, which are similar to the Golden Gate in design,
but are far less richly ornamented.These streets divided the building into four portions: those to the
north are so much ruined that it is not now easy to trace their plan, or
to say to what purpose they were dedicated; but probably the one might
have been the lodgings of the guests, the other the residence of the
principal officers of the household.The whole of the southern half of the building was devoted to the palace
properly so called.It contained two temples, as they are now
designated.That on the right is said to have been dedicated to Jupiter,
though, judging from its form, it would appear to have been designed
rather as the mausoleum of the founder than as a temple of that god.On
the assumption that it was a temple it has been illustrated at a
previous page.[199] Opposite to it is another small temple, dedicated,
it is said, to Æsculapius.Between these two is the arcade represented in Woodcut No.185, at the
upper end of which is the vestibule—circular, as all buildings dedicated
to Vesta, or taking their name from that goddess, should be.This opened
directly on to a magnificent suite of nine apartments, occupying the
principal part of the south front of the palace.Beyond these, on the
right hand, were the private apartments of the emperor, and behind them
his baths.The opposite side is restored as if it exactly corresponded,
but this is more than doubtful; and, indeed, there is scarcely
sufficient authority for many of the details shown in the plan, though
they are, probably, on the whole, sufficiently exact to convey a general
idea of the arrangements of a Roman imperial palace.(From Sir Gardner
Wilkinson’s ‘Dalmatia.’)]

Perhaps, however, the most splendid feature in this palace was the great
southern gallery, 515 ft.in length by 24 in width, extending along the
whole seaward face of the building.Besides its own intrinsic beauty as
an architectural feature, it evinces an appreciation of the beauties of
nature which one would hardly expect in a Roman.This great arcade is
the principal feature in the whole design, and commands a view well
worthy the erection of such a gallery for its complete enjoyment.POMPEII AND HERCULANEUM.Failing to discover any example of domestic architecture in Rome, we
turn to Pompeii and Herculaneum, where we find numerous and most
interesting examples of houses of all classes, except, perhaps, the
best; for there is nothing there to compare with the Laurentian villa of
Pliny, or with some others of which descriptions have come down to us.Pompeii, moreover, was far more a Grecian than a Roman city, and its
buildings ought to be considered rather as illustrative of those of
Greece, or at least of Magna Græcia, than of anything found to the
northward.Still these cities belonged to the Roman age, and, except in
taste and in minor arrangements, we have no reason to doubt that the
buildings did resemble those of Rome, at least to a sufficient extent
for illustration.With scarcely an exception, all the houses of Pompeii were of one storey
only in height.It is true that in some we find staircases leading to
the roof, and traces of an upper storey, but where this latter is the
case the apartments would appear to have been places for washing and
drying clothes, or for some such domestic purpose rather than for living
or even sleeping rooms.All the principal apartments were certainly on
the ground floor, and as an almost inevitable corollary from this, they
all faced inwards, and were lighted from courtyards or _atria_, and not
from the outside; for, with a people who had not glass with which to
glaze their windows, it was impossible to enjoy privacy or security
without at the same time excluding both light and air, otherwise than by
lighting their rooms from the interior.Hence it arose that in most
instances the outside of the better class of houses was given up to
shops and smaller dwellings, which opened on to the street, while the
residence, with the exception of the principal entrance, and sometimes
one or two private doors that opened outwards, was wholly hidden from
view by their entourage.Even in the smallest class of tradesmen’s houses which opened on the
street, one apartment seems always to have been left unroofed to light
at least two rooms on each side of it, used as bedrooms; but as the
roofs of all are now gone, it is not always easy to determine which were
so treated.It is certain that, in the smallest houses which can have belonged to
persons at all above the class of shopkeepers, there was always a
central apartment, unroofed in the centre, into which the others opened.Sometimes this was covered by two beams placed in one direction, and two
crossing them at right angles, framing the roof into nine compartments,
generally of unequal dimensions, the central one being open, and with a
corresponding sinking in the floor to receive the rain and drainage
which inevitably came through it.When this court was of any extent,
four pillars were required at the intersection of the beams, or angles
of the opening, to support the roof.In larger courts eight, twelve,
sixteen, or more columns were so employed, often apparently more as
decorative objects than as required by the constructive necessities of
the case, and very frequently the numbers of these on either side of the
apartment did not correspond.Frequently the angles were not right
angles, and the pillars were spaced unequally with a careless disregard
of symmetry that strikes us as strange, though in such cases this may
have been preferable to cold and formal regularity, and even more
productive of grace and beauty.Besides these courts, there generally
existed in the rear of the house another bounded by a dead wall at the
further extremity, and which in the smaller houses was painted, to
resemble the garden which the larger mansions possessed in this
direction.The apartments looking on this court were of course perfectly
private, which cannot be said of any of those looking inwards on the
_atrium_.The house called that of Pansa at Pompeii is a good illustration of
these peculiarities, and, as one of the most regular, has been
frequently chosen for the purpose of illustration.(From Gell’s ‘Pompeii’)
Scale 100 ft to 1 in.]248) all the parts that do not belong
to the principal mansion are shaded darker except the doubtful part
marked A, which may either have been a separate house, or the women’s
apartments belonging to the principal one, or, what is even more
probable, it may have been designed so as to be used for either purpose.B is certainly a separate house, and the whole of the remainder of this
side, of the front, and of the third side, till we come opposite to A,
was let off as shops.At C we have the kitchen and servants’ apartments,
with a private entrance to the street, and an opening also to the
principal peristyle of the house.Returning to the principal entrance or front door D, you enter through a
short passage into the outer court E, on each side of which are several
small apartments, used either by the inferior members of the household
or by guests.A wider passage than the entrance leads from this to the
peristyle, or principal apartment of the house.On the left hand are
several small rooms, used no doubt as sleeping apartments, which were
probably closed by half-doors open above and below, so as to admit air
and light, while preserving sufficient privacy, for Roman tastes at
least.In front and on the right hand are two larger rooms, either of
which may have been the triclinium or dining-room, the other being what
we should call the drawing-room of the house.A passage between the
kitchen and the central room leads to a verandah which crosses the whole
length of the house, and is open to the garden beyond.As will be observed, architectural effect has been carefully studied in
this design, a vista nearly 300 ft.in length being obtained from the
outer door to the garden wall, varied by a pleasing play of light and
shade, and displaying a gradually increasing degree of spaciousness and
architectural richness as we advance.All these points must have been
productive of the most pleasing effect when complete, and of more beauty
than has been attained in almost any modern dwelling of like dimensions.Generally speaking the architectural details of the Pompeian houses are
carelessly and ungracefully moulded, though it cannot be denied that
sometimes a certain elegance of feeling runs through them that pleases
in spite of our better judgment.It was not, however, on form that they
depended for their effect; and consequently it is not by that that they
must be judged.The whole architecture of the house was, but
even this was not considered so important as the paintings which covered
the flat surfaces of the walls.Comparing the Pompeian decoration with
that of the baths of Titus, and those of the House of Livia, the only
specimens of the same age and class found in Rome, it must be admitted
that the Pompeian examples show an equally correct taste, not only in
the choice but in the application of the ornaments used, though in the
execution there is generally that difference that might be expected
between paintings executed for a private individual and those for the
Emperor of the Roman world.Notwithstanding this, these paintings, so
wonderfully preserved in this small provincial town, are even now among
the best specimens we possess of mural decoration.They excel the
ornamentation of the Alhambra, as being more varied and more
intellectual.For the same reason they are superior to the works of the
same class executed by the Moslems in Egypt and Persia, and they are far
superior to the rude attempts of the Gothic architects in the Middle
Ages; still they are probably as inferior to what the Greeks did in
their best days as the pillars of the Pompeian peristyles are to the
porticoes of the Parthenon.But though doubtless far inferior to their
originals, those at Pompeii are direct imitations of true Greek
decorative forms; and it is through them alone that we can form even the
most remote idea of the exquisite beauty to which polychromatic
architecture once attained, but which we can scarcely venture to hope it
will ever reach again.One curious point which has hitherto been too much overlooked is, that
in Pompeii there are two perfectly distinct styles of decoration.One of
these is purely Etruscan, both in form and colour, and such as is only
found in the tombs or on the authentic works of the Etruscans.The other
is no less essentially Greek, both in design and colour: it is far more
common than the Etruscan form, and is always easily to be distinguished
from it.The last-mentioned or Greek style of decoration may be again
divided into two varieties; one, the most common, consisting of
ornaments directly copied from Greek models; the other with a
considerable infusion of Roman forms.This Romanised variety of Greek
decoration represents an attenuated and lean style of architecture,
which could only have come into fashion from the continued use of iron
or bronze, or other metallic substances, for pillars and other
architectural members.Vitruvius reprobates it; and in a later age
Cassiodorus speaks of it in a manner which shows that it was practised
in his time.The general adoption of this class of ornament, both at
Pompeii and in the baths of Titus, proves it to have been a very
favourite style at that time.This being the case, it must have either
been a representation of metallic pillars and other architectural
objects then in use, or it must have been copied from painted
decorations.This is a new subject, and cannot be made clear, except at
considerable length and with the assistance of many drawings.It seems,
however, an almost undoubted fact that the Romans did use metal as a
constructive material.Were it only that columns of extreme tenuity are
represented in these paintings, we might be inclined to ascribe it to
mere incorrect drawing; but the whole style of ornament here shown is
such as is never found in stone or brick pillars, and which is only
susceptible of execution in metal.Besides this, the pillars in question
are always shown in the decorations as though simply gilt or bronzed,
while the representations of stone pillars are.All this
evidence goes to prove that a style of art once existed in which metal
was generally employed in all the principal features, all material
traces of which are now lost.The disappearance of all remains of such a
style is easily accounted for by the perishable nature of iron from
rust, and the value and consequent peculation induced by bronze and
similar metals.We are, moreover, aware that much bronze has been
stolen, even in recent days, from the Pantheon and other buildings which
are known to have been adorned with it.Another thing which we learn from these paintings is, that though the
necessities of street architecture compelled these city mansions to take
a rectilinear outline, whenever the Roman architects built in the
country they indulged in a picturesque variety of outline and of form,
which they carried perhaps as far as even the Gothic architects of the
Middle Ages.This indeed we might have expected, from their carelessness
in respect to regularity in their town-houses; but these were interiors,
and were it not for the painted representations of houses, we should
have no means of judging how the same architects would treat an exterior
in the country.From this source, however, we learn that in the exterior
arrangements, in situations where they were not cramped by confined
space, their plans were totally free from all stiffness and formality.In this respect Roman taste coincided with that of all true architecture
in all parts of the world.Each part of the design was left to tell its own tale and to express the
use to which each apartment was applied, though the whole were probably
grouped together with some reference to symmetry.There is certainly
nothing in these ancient examples to justify the precise regularity
which the architects of the Renaissance introduced into their classical
designs, in which they sought to obliterate all distinction between the
component parts in a vain attempt to make one great whole out of a great
number of small discordant fragments.BRIDGES AND AQUEDUCTS.Perhaps the most satisfactory works of the Romans are those which we
consider as belonging to civil engineering rather than to architecture.The distinction, however, was not known in those earlier days.The
Romans set about works of this class with a purpose-like earnestness
that always ensures success, and executed them on a scale which leaves
nothing to be desired; while at the same time they entirely avoided that
vulgarity which their want of refinement allowed almost inevitably to
appear in more delicate or more ornate buildings.Their engineering
works also were free from that degree of incompleteness which is
inseparable from the state of transition in which their architecture was
during the whole period of the Empire.It is owing to these causes that
the substructions of the Appian way strike every beholder with
admiration and astonishment; and nothing impresses the traveller more,
on visiting the once imperial city, than the long lines of aqueducts
that are seen everywhere stretching across the now deserted plain of the
Campagna.It is true they are mere lines of brick arches, devoid of
ornament and of every attempt at architecture properly so called; but
they are so well adapted to the purpose for which they were designed, so
grand in conception, and so perfect in execution, that, in spite of
their want of architectural character, they are among the most beautiful
of the remains of Roman buildings.The aqueducts were not, however, all so devoid of architectural design
as those of the Campagna.That, for instance, known as the Pont du Gard,
built to convey water to the town of Nîmes in France, is one of the most
striking works of antiquity.Its height above the stream is about 180
ft., divided into two tiers of larger arches surmounted by a range of
smaller ones, giving the structure the same finish and effect that an
entablature and cornice gives to a long range of columns.Without the
introduction of one single ornament, or of any member that was not
absolutely wanted, this arrangement converts what is a mere utilitarian
work into an architectural screen of a beauty hitherto unrivalled in its
class.The aqueducts of Segovia and Tarragona in Spain, though not perhaps so
grand, are quite as elegant and appropriate as this; and if they stood
across a line of well wooded and watered valleys, might form as
beautiful objects.Unfortunately the effect is much marred by the houses
and other objects that crowd their bases.above the level of their foundation in the centre.That of Segovia
is raised on light piers, the effect of which is perhaps somewhat
spoiled by numerous offsets, and the upper tier is if anything too light
for the lower.These defects are avoided at Tarragona, the central
arches of which are shown in Woodcut No.In this example the
proportion of the upper to the lower arcade is more perfect, and the
whole bears a character of lightness combined with constructive solidity
and elegance unrivalled, so far as I know, in any other work of its
class.It wants, however, the grandeur of the Pont du Gard; for though
its length is about the same, exceeding 800 ft., it has neither its
height nor the impression of power given by the great arches of that
building, especially when contrasted with those that are smaller.Aqueduct of Tarragona.The Roman bridges were designed on the same grand scale as their
aqueducts, though from their nature they of course could not possess the
same grace and lightness.This was, however, more than compensated by
their inherent solidity and by the manifestation of strength imparted by
the Romans to all these structures.They seem to have been designed to
last for ever; and but for the violence of man, it would be hardly
possible to set limits to their durability.Many still remain in almost
every corner of the Roman Empire; and wherever found are easily
recognised by the unmistakable impress of Roman grandeur which is
stamped upon them.One of the most remarkable of these is that which Trajan erected at
Alcantara, in Spain, represented in the annexed woodcut.The roadway is
perfectly level, as is generally the case in Roman bridges, though the
mode by which this is obtained, of springing the arches from different
levels, is perhaps not the most pleasing.To us at least it is
unfamiliar, and has never, I think, been adopted in modern times.In
such a case we should either have made the arches all equal—a mistake,
considering their different heights—or have built solidly over the
smaller arches to bring up the level, which would have been a far
greater error in construction than the other is in taste.The bridge
consists of six arches, the whole length of the roadway being 650 ft.;
the two central arches are about 100 ft.above the level of the stream which it crosses.The piers are well
proportioned and graceful; and altogether the work is as fine and as
tasteful an example of bridge-building as can be found anywhere, even in
these days of engineering activity.Bridge of Trajan, at Alcantara, in Spain.]The bridge which the same Emperor erected over the Danube was a far more
difficult work in an engineering point of view; but the superstructure
being of wood, resting only on stone piers, it would necessarily have
possessed much less architectural beauty than this, or indeed than many
others.These examples of this class of Roman works must suffice; they are so
typical of the style that it was impossible to omit them altogether,
though the subject scarcely belongs in strictness to the objects of this
work.The bridges and aqueducts of the Romans richly deserve the
attention of the architect, not only because they are in fact the only
works which the Romans, either from taste or from social position, were
enabled to carry out without affectation, and with all their originality
and power, but also because it was in building these works that the
Romans acquired that constructive skill and largeness of proportion
which enabled them to design and carry out works of such vast
dimensions, to vault such spaces, and to give to their buildings
generally that size and impress of power which form their chief and
frequently their only merit.It was this too that enabled them to
originate that new style of vaulted buildings which at one period of the
Middle Ages promised to reach a degree of perfection to which no
architecture of the world had ever attained.The Gothic style, it is
true, perished at a time when it was very far from completed; but it is
a point of no small interest to know where and under what circumstances
it was invented.We shall subsequently have to trace how far it advanced
towards that perfection at which it aimed, but to which it never
reached.Strangely enough, it failed solely because of the revival and
the pernicious influence of that very parent style to which it owed its
birth, and the growth and maturity of which we have just been
describing.It was the grandeur of the edifices reared at Rome in the
first centuries of the Empire which so impressed the architects of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, that they abandoned their own
beautiful style to imitate that of the Romans, but with an incongruity
which seems inevitably to result from all imitations, as contrasted with
true creations, in architectural art.PARTHIAN AND SASSANIAN ARCHITECTURE.Historical notice—Palaces of Al Hadhr and Diarbekr—Domes—Palaces of

There still remains one other style to be described before leaving the
domain of Heathendom to venture into the wide realms of Christian and
Saracenic art with which the remainder of these two volumes is mainly
occupied.Unfortunately it is not one that was of great importance while
it existed, and it is one of which we know very little at present.This
arises partly from the fact that all the principal buildings of the
Sassanian kings were situated on or near the alluvial plains of
Mesopotamia and were therefore built either of sun-burnt or imperfectly
baked bricks, which consequently crumbled to dust, or, where erected
with more durable materials, these have been quarried by the succeeding
inhabitants of these fertile regions.Partly also it arises from the
Sassanians not being essentially a building race.Their religion
required no temples and their customs repudiated the splendour of the
sepulchre, so that their buildings were mainly palaces.One of these,
that at Dustagird, is described by all contemporary historians[200] as
one of the most gorgeous palaces of the East, but its glories were
ephemeral: gold and silver and precious hangings rich in colour and
embroidery made up a splendour in which the more stable arts of
architecture had but little part, and all perished in an hour when
invaded by the victorious soldiers of Heraclius, or the more destructive
hosts of Arabian invaders a few years afterwards.Whatever the cause
however, never was destruction more complete.Two or three ruined
palaces still exist in Persia and Mesopotamia.A fragment known as the
Tâk Kesra still remains to indicate the spot where Ctesiphon once stood,
but the site of Dustagird is still a matter of dispute.So little in
fact remains that we should hardly be able to form an idea of what the
style really was, but for the fortunate discovery of a palace at Mashita
in Moab, which seems undoubtedly to have been erected by the last great
king of this dynasty, and which is yet unsurpassed for beauty of detail
and richness of ornament by any building of its class and age.As nearly as may be, one thousand years had elapsed since the completion
of the palaces at Persepolis and Susa and the commencement of this
building, and for the great part of that period the history of Persian
or Central Asian architecture is a blank.The Seleucidæ built nothing
that has come down to our times.The Parthians, too, have left us
little, so that it is practically only after a hiatus of nearly six
centuries, that we again begin to feel that the art had not entirely
perished in the populous countries of Central Asia; but even then our
history recommences so timidly and with buildings of such uncertain
dates as to be very far from satisfactory.One of the oldest buildings known as belonging to the new school is the
palace of Al Hadhr, situated in the plain, about thirty miles from the
Tigris, nearly west from the ruins of Kaleh Shergat.The city itself is circular in plan, nearly an English mile in diameter,
and surrounded by a stone wall with towers at intervals, in the centre
of which stands a walled enclosure, nearly square in plan, about 700 ft.This is again subdivided into an outer and inner court by a wall
across its centre.The outer court is unencumbered by buildings, the
inner nearly filled with them.[201] The principal of these is that
represented in plan on Woodcut No.It consists of three large and
four smaller halls placed side by side, with various smaller apartments
in the rear.All these halls are roofed by semicircular tunnel-vaults,
without ribs or other ornament, and they are all entirely open in front,
all the light and air being admitted from the one end.There can be little doubt that these halls are copies, or intended to be
so, of the halls of the old Assyrian palaces; but the customs and
requirements of the period have led the architect on to a new class of
arrangements which renders the resemblance by no means apparent at first
sight.Elevation of part of the Palace of Al Hadhr.The old halls had almost invariably their entrances on the longer side,
which with a vault required very thick external walls as abutments.This
was obviated in Al Hadhr by using the halls as abutments the one to the
other like the arches of a bridge; so that, if the two external arches
were firm, all the rest were safe.This was provided for by making the
outer halls smaller, as shown in the elevation (Woodcut No.254), or by
strengthening the outer wall.But even then the architect seems to have
shrunk from weakening the intermediate walls by making too many openings
in them.Those which do exist are small and infrequent; so that there is
generally only one entrance to each apartment, and that so narrow as to
seem incongruous with the size of the room to which it leads.The square apartment at the back would seem to have been a temple, as
the lintel over the entrance doorway (which faces the east) is carved
with the sun, the moon, and other religious emblems; and the double wall
round may have contained a stair or inclined plane leading to an upper
storey, or to rooms which certainly existed over the smaller halls at
least.All the details of the building are copied from the Roman—the archivolts
and pilasters almost literally so, but still so rudely executed as to
prove that it was not done under the direct superintendence of a Roman
artist.This is even more evident with regard to the griffins and
scroll-work, and the acanthus-leaves which ornament the capitals and
friezes.The most peculiar ornament, however, is the range of masks
carried round all the archivolts of the smaller arches.Of the nineteen
voussoirs of the larger arches, seven of them, according to Ross and
Ainsworth, had figures carved on them in relief of angels, or females,
apparently in the air, and with feet crossed and robes flying loose,
possibly emblematic of the seven planets.Even tradition is silent
regarding the date of these remarkable ruins; the town was besieged
unsuccessfully by Trajan in 116 A.D., and it is recorded to have been a
walled town containing a temple of the sun noted for its rich offerings.This is probably the square building at the back of the great hall on
the left of the palace, and the existence of the carved religious
emblems on the lintel suggest that the palace was erected in front at a
later period.Professor Rawlinson, in his notes on the great
monarchies,[202] suggests about 200 A.D.as the probable date, and
ascribes its erection to the monarchs of the Parthian dynasty.There is
no doubt that the execution of the masonry with its fine joints is of a
totally different character from that which is found in Sassanian
buildings, which comes more under the head of rubble masonry, and was
entirely hidden, in the interior at least, by stucco.The ornament also
is of a rich character, Roman in its design, but debased Greek in its
execution.Loftus, during his researches in Chaldea, discovered at
Wurka (the ancient Erech in Mesopotamia), a large number of ornamental
details, in stone and in plaster, of precisely the same character as
those found at Al Hadhr.Among these remains he found a griffin
resembling those carved on the lintel of the square temple before
referred to, and quantities of Parthian coins, so that it is fair to
assume that Al Hadhr belongs to that dynasty.Another building which merits more attention than has hitherto been
bestowed upon it, is now used as the great mosque at Diarbekr.The
ancient portions consist of the façades only of two palaces, the north
and the south, which face one another at a distance of some 400 feet,
and form the boundaries of the great court (Woodcut No.They are
apparently erected with materials taken from some more ancient building,
and whilst the capitals and friezes are of debased Roman character, the
carved shafts of the north palace (Woodcut No.257) resemble in the
plaster design ornaments found at Wurka.256, which represents the façade of the
South Palace, the openings of the ground storey are spanned by arches of
two different forms; and those of the upper storey by lintels carried on
corbels with relieving arch over; the latter a Byzantine treatment; the
former of a very much later date, and probably Saracenic: above the
openings and under the frieze are Cufic inscriptions.On the whole there
seems little doubt that the building we now see was erected, as it now
stands, at the age of the Cufic inscriptions,[203] whatever they may be,
but that the remains of some more ancient edifice was most skilfully
worked up in the new.Till, however, the building is carefully examined
by some thoroughly competent person, this must remain doubtful.The
building is rich, and so interesting that it is to be hoped that its
history and peculiarities will before long be investigated.Façade of South Palace at Diarbekr.]With the accession of the Sassanians, A.D.223, Persia regained much of
that power and stability to which she had been so long a stranger.The
capture of the Roman Emperor Valerian by the 2nd king of the race, A.D.260, the Conquest of Armenia and victories over Galerius by the 7th
(A.D.296), and the exploits of the 14th King, Bahram Gaur, his visit to
India and his alliance with its kings, all point to extended power
abroad; while the improvement in the fine arts at home indicates
returning prosperity and a degree of security unknown since the fall of
the Achæmenidæ.These kings seem to have been of native race, and claimed descent from
the older dynasties: at all events they restored the ancient religion
and many of the habits and customs with which we are familiar as
existing before the time of Alexander the Great.View in the Court of the Great Mosque at Diarbekr.]As before remarked, fire-worship does not admit of temples, and we
consequently miss that class of buildings which in all ages best
illustrates the beauties of architecture; and it is only in a few
scattered remains of palaces that we are able to trace the progress of
the style.Such as they are, they indicate considerable originality and
power, but at the same time point to a state of society when attention
to security hardly allowed the architect the free exercise of the more
delicate ornaments of his art.The Sassanians took up the style where it was left by the builders of Al
Hadhr; but we only find it after a long interval of time, during which
changes had taken place which altered it to a considerable extent, and
made it in fact into a new and complete style.They retained the great tunnel-like halls of Al Hadhr, but only as
entrances.They cut bold arches through the dividing walls, so as to
form them into lateral suites.But, above all, they learnt to place
domes on the intersections of their halls, not resting on drums, but on
pendentives,[204] and did not even attempt to bring down simulated lines
of support to the ground.Besides all these constructive peculiarities,
they lost all trace of Roman detail, and adopted a system of long
reed-like pilasters, extending from the ground to the cornice, below
which they were joined by small semicircular arches.They in short
adopted all the peculiarities which are found in the Byzantine style as
carried out at a later age in Armenia and the East.We must know more of
this style, and be able to ascribe authentic dates to such examples as
we are acquainted with, before we can decide whether the Sassanians
borrowed the style from the Eastern Romans, or whether they themselves
were in fact the inventors from whom the architects of the more western
nations took the hints which they afterwards so much improved upon.The various steps by which the Romans advanced from the construction of
buildings like the Pantheon to that of the church of Sta.Sophia at
Constantinople are so consecutive and so easily traced as to be
intelligible in themselves without the necessity of seeking for any
foreign element which may have affected them.If it really was so, and
the architecture of Constantinople was not influenced from the East, we
must admit that the Sassanian was an independent and simultaneous
invention, possessing characteristics well worthy of study.It is quite
certain too that this style had a direct influence on the Christian and
Moslem styles of Asia, which exhibit many features not derivable from
any of the more Western styles.Section on line A B of Palace at Serbistan.A few examples will render this clearer than it can be made in words.258 and 259) of a small but
interesting palace at Serbistan will explain most of the peculiarities
of the style.The entrances, it will be observed, are deep tunnel-like
arches, but the centre is covered by a dome resting on pendentives.In
the palace of Firouzabad these are constructed by throwing a series of
arches across the angles, one recessed behind the other, the lower ones
serving as centres for those above, until a circular base for the dome
has been obtained; but here in Serbistan they do not seem to have known
this expedient: the lower courses run through to the angle, and the
upper ones are brought forward in so irregular and unscientific a way as
to suggest that for their support they placed their reliance almost
entirely on the tenacious qualities of the mortar.That which, however,
would have formed the outer arch of the pendentive is wrought on the
stone down almost to the springing, as if the builder of Serbistan had
seen regular arched pendentives of some kind, but did not know how to
build them.This is the more remarkable because, as we shall see later
on, they knew how to construct semi-domes over their recesses or square
niches, and in regular coursed masonry; if they had applied these to the
angles, they would have invented the squinch, a kind of pendentive
employed in Romanesque work in the south of France.The dome is
elliptical, as are also the barrel vaults over the entrances, the
recesses in the central hall, and the vaults over the lateral halls.In
these lateral halls piers are built within the walls, forming a series
of recesses; these either have transverse arches thrown across them
where the lofty doorways come, or are covered with semidomes in regular
coursed masonry, the angles being filled in below them with small
arches.The lower portions of the piers consist of circular columns
about six feet high, behind which a passage is formed.The builders thus
obtained the means of counteracting the thrust of the vault, without
breaking the external outline by buttresses and without occupying much
room on the floor, while at the same time these projections added
considerably to the architectural effect of the interior.The date of
the building is not correctly known, but it most probably belongs to the
age of Shapour, in the middle of the fourth century.The palace at Firouzabad is probably a century more modern, and is
erected on a far more magnificent scale, being in fact the typical
building of the style, so far at least as we at present know.(From Flandin and Coste.)]As will be seen in the plan, the great central entrance opens laterally
into two side chambers, and the inner of these into a suite of three
splendid domed apartments, occupying the whole width of the building.Beyond this is an inner court, surrounded by apartments all opening upon
it.261, representing one of the
doorways in the domed halls, the details have nothing Roman about them,
but are borrowed directly from Persepolis, with so little change that
the style, so far as we can now judge, is almost an exact reproduction,
except that the work is only surface ornament in plaster, and is an
irregular and a degraded copy of the original stone features at
Persepolis.The opening also is spanned by a circular arch under the
lintel of the Persian example, the former being the real constructive
feature, the latter a decorative imitation.The portion of the exterior
represented in Woodcut No.262 tells the same tale, though for its
prototype we must go back still further to the ruins at Wurka—the
building called Wuswus at that place (see p.165) being a palace
arranged very similarly to these, and adorned externally by panellings
and reeded pilasters, differing from these buildings only in detail and
arrangement, but in all essentials so like them as to prove that the
Sassanians borrowed most of their peculiarities from earlier native
examples.The building itself is a perfectly regular parallelogram, 332 ft.by
180, without a single break, or even an opening of any sort, except the
one great arch of the entrance; and externally it has no ornament but
the repetition of the tall pilasters and narrow arches represented in
Woodcut No.Its aspect is thus simple and severe, but more like a
gigantic Bastile than the palace of a gay, pavilion-loving people, like
the Persians.Internally the arrangement of the halls is simple and appropriate, and,
though somewhat too formal, is dignified and capable of considerable
architectural display.On the whole, however, its formality is perhaps
less pleasing than the more picturesque arrangements of the palace at
Serbistan last described.Part of External Wall, Firouzabad.Another century probably elapsed before Khosru (Nushirvan) commenced the
most daring, though certainly not the most beautiful ever attempted by
any of his race; for to him we must ascribe the well-known Tâk Kesra
(Woodcuts Nos.263, 264), the only important ruin that now marks the
site of the Ctesiphon of the Greeks—the great Modain of the Arabian
conquerors.As it is, it is only a fragment of a palace, a façade similar in
arrangement to that at Firouzabad, but on a much larger scale, its width
being 312 ft., its height 105 to 110, and the depth of the remaining
block 170 ft.In the centre is a magnificent portal, the Aiwan, or
Throne room of the palace, vaulted over with an elliptical barrel vault
and similar to the smaller vestibules of Serbistan and Firouzabad; the
lower portion of the arch, the springing of which is about 40 ft.from
the ground, is built in horizontal courses up to 63 ft.above the
ground, above which comes the portion arched with regular voussoirs; by
this method not only was an enormous centering saved, but the thrust of
that portion built with voussoirs was brought well within the thickness
of the side walls.It is probable that the front portion of the arch,
about 20 ft.in depth, was built on walls erected temporarily for that
purpose; the remainder of the vault, however, was possibly erected
without centres, the bricks being placed flatwise and the rings being
inclined at an angle of about 10° towards the back of the front arch.The tenacious quality of the mortar was probably sufficient to hold the
bricks in their places till the arch ring was complete, so that the
centering was virtually a template only, giving the correct form of the
ellipse, and constructed with small timbers so as to save expense.A
similar method of construction was found by Sir Henry Layard in the
drain vaults at Nimroud, and it exists in the granaries built by Rameses
II.in the rear of the Rameseum at Thebes.The lower or inner portion of
the great arch is built in four rings of bricks or tiles laid flatwise,
two of which are carried down to the springing of the whole arch: above
these in the upper portion of the arch comes a ring 3 feet in height,
regularly built in voussoir-shaped bricks breaking joint, on the surface
of which are cut a series of seventeen foils, the whole being crowned by
a slightly projecting moulding.These have nothing to do with the
construction, and are simply a novel method of decoration carved after
the arch was built.Plan of Tâk Kesra at Ctesiphon.(From Flandin and
Coste.)Elevation of Great Arch of Tâk Kesra at Ctesiphon.The wall flanking the great arch on either side is decorated with
buttress shafts and blind arches, which are partially constructive, and
intended to support and strengthen those portions of the wall which were
simply screens, or to resist the thrust of the walls of the vaulted
chambers behind, consisting of one storey only.Decoratively they divide
up the front and were apparently introduced in imitation of the great
Roman amphitheatres.The position occupied by these semi-detached shafts
on the first storey (resting on the ledge left by the greater thickness
of wall of the lower storey), which are not in the axes of those below,
proves that the Sassanian architect thought more of their constructive
value as buttresses, than of their architectural value as superimposed
features.Sketch Plan of Palace at Mashita.]Though it may not perhaps be beautiful, there is certainly something
grand in a great vaulted entrance, 72 ft.in height and
115 in depth, though it makes the doorway at the inner end and all the
adjoining parts look extremely small.It would have required the rest of
the palace to be carried out on an unheard-of scale to compensate for
this defect.The Saracenic architects got over the difficulty by making
the great portal a semidome, and by cutting it up with ornaments and
details, so that the doorway looked as large as was required for the
space left for it.Here, in the parent form, all is perfectly plain in
the interior, and painting alone could have been employed to relieve its
nakedness, which, however, it never would have done effectually.[205]

The ornaments in these and in all the other buildings of the Sassanians
having been executed in plaster, we should hardly be able to form an
idea of the richness of detail they once possessed but for the fortunate
discovery of a palace erected in Moab by Khosru Purviz, the last great
monarch of this line.[206]

As will be seen from the woodcut (No.265), the whole building is a
square, measuring above 500 ft.each way, but only the inner portion of
it, about 170 ft.square, marked E E, has been ever finished or
inhabited.It was apparently originally erected as a hunting-box on the
edge of the desert for the use of the Persian king, and preserves all
the features we are familiar with in Sassanian palaces.It is wholly in
brick, and contains in the centre a triapsal hall, once surmounted by a
dome on pendentives like those at Serbistan or Firouzabad.On either
side were eight vaulted halls with intermediate courts almost identical
with those found at Eski Bagdad[207] or at Firouzabad.So far there is
nothing either remarkable or interesting, except the peculiarity of
finding a Persian building in such a situation, and in the fact that the
capitals of the pillars are of that full-curved shape which are first
found in the works of Justinian, which so far helps to fix the date of
the building.It seems, however, that at a time when Chosroes possessed all Asia and
part of Africa, from the Indus to the Nile, and maintained a camp for
ten years on the shores of the Bosphorus, in sight of Constantinople,
that this modest abode no longer sufficed for the greatest monarch of
the day.He consequently determined to add to it the enclosure above
described, and to ornament it with a portal which should exceed in
richness anything of the sort to be found in Syria.Unfortunately for
the history of art, this design was never carried out.When the walls
were raised to the height of about twenty feet, the workmen were called
off, most probably in consequence of the result of the battle of Nineveh
in 627; and the stones remain half hewn, the ornament unfinished, and
the whole exactly as if left in a panic, never to be resumed.Interior of ruined triapsal Hall of Palace.]The length of the façade—marked A A in plan, Woodcut No.265—between the
plain towers, which are the same all round, is about 170 ft.,[208] the
centre of which was occupied by a square-headed portal flanked by two
octagonal towers.Each face of these towers was ornamented by an
equilateral triangular pediment, filled with the richest sculpture.267, two large animals are represented facing
one another on the opposite sides of a vase, on which are two doves, and
out of which springs a vine which spreads over the whole surface of the
triangle, interspersed with birds and bunches of grapes.In another
panel one of the lions is represented with wings, evidently the last
lineal descendant of those found at Nineveh and Persepolis, and in all
are curious hexagonal rosettes, carved with a richness far exceeding
anything found in Gothic architecture, but which are found repeated with
very little variation in the Jaina temples of western India.One Compartment of Western Octagon Tower of the
Persian Palace at Mashita.]The wing walls of the façade are almost more beautiful than the central
part itself.As on the towers, the ornamentation consists of a series of
triangles filled with incised decorations and with rosettes in their
centres; while, as will be observed in Woodcut No.265, the decoration
in each panel is varied, and all are unfinished.The cornice only exists
at one angle, and the mortice stones never were inserted that were meant
to keep it in its place.Enough however remains to enable us to see
that, as a surface decoration, it is nearly unrivalled in beauty and
appropriateness.As an external form I know nothing like it.It is only
matched by that between the arches of the interior of Sta.Sophia at
Constantinople, which is so near it in age that they may be considered
as belonging to the same school of art.Part of West Wing Wall of External Façade of Palace
at Mashita.Elevation of External Façade of the Mashita, as
restored by the Author.]Notwithstanding the incomplete state in which this façade was left,
there does not seem much difficulty in restoring it within very narrow
limits of certainty.The elevation cannot have differed greatly from
that shown in Woodcut No.In the first place
there must have been a great arch over the entrance doorway—this is _de
rigueur_ in Sassanian art, and this must have been stilted or
horse-shoed, as without that it could not be made to fit on to the
cornice in the towers, and all the arches in the interior take, as I am
informed, that shape.Besides this there is at Takt-i-Gero[209] a
Sassanian arch of nearly the same age and equally classical in design,
which is, like this one, horse-shoed to the extent of one-tenth of its
diameter; and at Urgub, in Asia Minor, all the rock-cut excavations
which are of this or an earlier age have this peculiarity in a marked
degree.[210]

Above this, the third storey, is a repetition of the lowest, on half its
scale—as in the Tâk Kesra,—but with this difference, that here the
angular form admits of its being carried constructively over the great
arch, so that it becomes a facsimile of an apse at Murano near
Venice,[211] which is adorned with the spoils of some desecrated
building of the same age, probably of Antioch or some city of Syria
destroyed by the Saracens.Above this the elevation is more open to
conjecture, but it is evident that the whole façade could not have been
less than 90 ft.in height, from the fact that the mouldings at the base
(Woodcut No.265) are the mouldings of a Corinthian column of that
height, and no architect with a knowledge of the style would have used
such mouldings four and a half feet in height, unless he intended his
building to be of a height equal at least to that proportion.The domes
are those of Serbistan or of Amrith (Woodcut No.122); but such domes
are frequent in Syria before this age, and became more so afterwards.The great defect of the palace at Mashita as an illustration of
Sassanian art arises from the fact that, as a matter of course, Chosroes
did not bring with him architects or sculptors to erect this building.He employed the artists of Antioch or Damascus, or those of Syria, as he
found them.He traced the form and design of what he wanted, and left
them to execute it, and they introduced the vine—which had been the
principal “motif” in such designs from the time of Herod till the Moslem
invasion—and other details of the Byzantine art with which Justinian had
made them familiar from his buildings at Jerusalem, Antioch, and
elsewhere.Exactly the same thing happened in India six centuries later.When the Moslems conquered that country in the beginning of the
thirteenth century they built mosques at Delhi and Ajmere which are
still among the most beautiful to be found anywhere.The design and
outline are purely Saracenic, but every detail is Hindu, but, just as in
this case, more exquisite than anything the Moslems ever did afterwards
in that country.Though it thus stands almost alone, the discovery of this palace fills a
gap in our history such as no other building occupies up to the present
time.And when more, and more correct, details have been procured, it
will be well worthy of a monograph, which can hardly be attempted now
from the scanty materials available.Its greatest interest, however,
lies in the fact that all the Persian and Indian mosques were derived
from buildings of this class.The African mosques were enlargements of
the _atria_ of Christian basilicas, and this form is never found there,
but it is the key to all that was afterwards erected to the eastward.The palace of Rabbath Ammon (Woodcuts Nos.270, 271), also in Moab,
consists of a central court open to the sky, and four recesses or
transepts, one on each face; two of these are covered with elliptical
barrel vaults, and two with semidomes carried on pendentives.The
decoration of this palace is similar to that found at Mashita, but not
so rich in design or so good in its execution.The remains of two other palaces have been found in Persia, one at
Imumzade, which consists of a dome on pendentives, and a second, called
the Tag Eiran, made known to us by M. Dieulafoy, and published in his
work on the ancient art of Persia.[212] The latter is probably a late
example, for it shows a considerable advance in construction, and is
lighted by clerestory windows between the brick transverse arches which
span the hall.The plan consisted of a central hall, covered over by a
dome carried on pendentives, and two wings; of the original building,
only one of these wings remains, and two sides of the central hall, in
both cases up to the springing of the real arch, the lower courses being
horizontal as in the arch at Ctesiphon.Arch of Chosroes at Takt-i-Bostan.(From Flandin and
Coste.)]In the dearth of Sassanian buildings there is one other monument that it
is worth while quoting before closing this chapter.It is an archway or
grotto, which the same Chosroes cut in the rock at Takt-i-Bostan, near
Kermanshah (Woodcut No.Though so far removed from Byzantine
influence it is nearly as classical as the palace at Mashita.The flying
figures over the arch are evident copies of those adorning the triumphal
arches of the Romans, the mouldings are equally classical, and though
the costumes of the principal personages, and of those engaged in the
hunting scenes on either hand, partake more of Assyria than of Rome, the
whole betrays the influence of his early education and the diffusion of
Western arts at that time more than any other monument we know of.The
statue of Chosroes on his favourite black steed “Shubz diz,” is original
and interesting, and, with many of the details of this monument, it has
been introduced into the restoration of Mashita.This, it must be confessed, is but a meagre account of the architecture
of a great people.Perhaps it may be that the materials do not exist for
making it more complete; but what is more likely is that they have not
yet been looked for, but will be found when attention is fairly directed
to the subject.In the meanwhile what has been said regarding it will be
much clearer and better understood when we come to speak of the
Byzantine style, which overlapped the Sassanian, and was to some extent
contemporary with it.If a line were drawn north and south from Memel on the shores of the
Baltic to Spalato on the Adriatic, it would divide Europe into nearly
equal halves.All that part lying to the west of the line would be found
to be inhabited by nations of Celtic or Teutonic races, and all those to
the eastward of it by nations of Sclavonic origin, if—as we must do—we
exclude from present consideration those fragments of the effete
Turanian races which still linger to the westward, as well as the
intrusive hordes of the same family which temporarily occupy some fair
portions to the eastward of the line so drawn.This line is not of course quite straight, for it follows the boundary
between Germany on the one hand, and Russia and Poland on the other as
far as Cracow, while it crosses Hungary by the line of the Raab and
separates Dalmatia from Turkey.Though Sclavonic influences may be
detected to the westward of the boundary, they are faint and underlie
the Teutonic element; but to the eastward, the little province of
Siebenburgen, in the north-east corner of Hungary, forms the only little
oasis of Gothic art in the desert of Panslavic indifference to
architectural expression.Originally it was a Roman, afterwards a
German, colony, and maintained its Gothic style throughout the Middle
Ages.[213]

From Spalato the line crosses the Adriatic to Fermo, and then following
very closely the 43rd parallel of latitude, divides Italy into two
nearly equal halves.Barbarian tribes settled to a certain extent to the
northward of this boundary and influenced the style of architecture in
some degree; while to the southward of it, their presence can with
difficulty be detected, except in a few exceptional cases, and for a
very limited time.Architecturally all the styles of art practised during the Middle Ages
to the westward and northward of this boundary may be correctly and
graphically described as the Gothic style, using this term in a broad
sense.All those to the eastward may with equal propriety be designated
as the Byzantine style of art.Anterior, however, to the former there existed a transitional style
known as Romanesque, but which was virtually at first nothing more than
debased Roman.It was, in fact, a modification of the classical Roman
form which was introduced between the reigns of Constantine and
Justinian, and was avowedly an attempt to adapt classical forms to
Christian purposes.At first the materials of ancient buildings sufficed
for its wants, and if after the 4th century the style did not lapse into
absolute barbarism it was due to the influence which the Proto-Byzantine
style began to exert and to the magnificent works erected by Greek
artists at Parenzo and Grado in Dalmatia, at Ravenna, Milan, and even in
Rome herself.To the eastward of the line of demarcation the transition
was perfected under the reign of Justinian (A.D.527 to 564), when it
became properly entitled to the name of Byzantine.To the westward, in
Italy and the south of France, this first phase of the Romanesque
continued to be practised till the 6th or 7th centuries; but about that
time occurs an hiatus in the architectural history of Western Europe,
owing to the troubles which arose on the dissolution of the Roman Empire
and the irruption of the Barbarian hordes.When the art again
reappeared, it was strongly tinctured by Barbarian influences, and might
with propriety be designated the _Gothic style_, the essential
characteristic being that it is the architecture of a people differing
from the Romans or Italians in blood, and, it need hardly be added,
differing from them in a like ratio in their architectural conceptions.The term “Gothic,” however, is so generally adopted throughout Europe to
designate the style in which the intersecting vault with pointed arches
is the main characteristic, that to depart from it, even when subdivided
into round arched and pointed arched Gothic, would only lead to
confusion.It would therefore seem better to retain the nomenclature
usually employed in modern architectural works, and to class all the
phases of the transitional style between the Roman and the Gothic
periods under the broad title of Romanesque.This would include what we
have termed Early Christian——Lombardi——Rhenish——those phases of the
style which in Italy and France are influenced by Byzantine detail——the
pure Romanesque or Romance of the south of France——the Norman style in
Italy, Sicily, and the North of France, and——Saxon and Norman in our own
country.The attempt to restrict the term Romanesque within the confines
of the 6th and 7th centuries, which was formerly attempted, has proved
to be illusory, as it has never been recognised by any student of
architecture.At the same time it is not necessary to insist on the term
when describing its various phases, and when they are better known under
other terms.It is, however, of importance, when writing a general
history of all styles, to keep strictly to some definite system, and not
to adopt the nomenclature which has in some cases been given by persons
writing monographs of the style of their own particular country.The
Germans, for instance, are inclined to call the architecture of such
cathedrals as Spires, Worms, etc., by the absurd name of Byzantine,
though no features in them have ever been borrowed from the Eastern
capital, nor do they resemble the buildings of that part of Europe.The title Gothic, which was originally invented as a term of reproach,
and which was applied to the imaginary work of the western Barbarians
who at one time overthrew the western Empire and settled within its
limits, has no architectural or ethnological value, it being impossible
to point out any features, much less buildings, which the Goths
introduced, and which are not to be more correctly attributed to Roman
or Byzantine artists.If we except the tomb of Theodoric, all the works
in Ravenna are scarcely to be distinguished from the basilicas of the
Eastern Empire, and only embody such modifications as the material of
the country and a certain influence of debased Roman architecture in
Italy would naturally exert.The churches and thermæ which Theodoric is
said to have restored in Rome have no characteristics which are not
found in other buildings of the same class before his reign, and even in
Spain and the south of France, which was occupied more or less
continuously by the Visigoths for more than two centuries, there are no
features which they could claim to have invented.The term Gothic, therefore, is misplaced, but inasmuch as the Goths
never invented any style, there is not likely, if this fact is
recognised, to be any confusion in its adoption.The chief difficulty which presents itself in any attempt to classify
the work of the Romanesque and the Gothic styles is that of drawing a
line of demarcation between the two.It is not sufficient to take the
pointed arch, for in France a pointed arched barrel vault preceded the
round arched vault; and in the East, as we know, the pointed arch made
its appearance at a much earlier period: that characteristic, therefore,
must not be too rigidly insisted upon.Beyond this general classification, the use of local names, when
available, will always be found most convenient.First, the country, or
architectural province, in which an example is found should be
ascertained, so that its locality may be marked, and if possible with
the addition of a dynastic or regal name to point out its epoch.When
the outline is sufficiently marked, it may be convenient, as the French
do, to speak of the style of the 13th century[214] as applied to their
own country.The terms they use always seem to be better than 1st, or
2nd, Middle Pointed, or even “Geometric,” “Decorated,” or
“Perpendicular,” or such general names as neither tell the country nor
the age, nor even accurately describe the style, though when they have
become general it may seem pedantic to refuse to use them.The system of
using local, combined, and dynastic names has been followed in
describing all the styles hitherto enumerated in this volume, and will
be followed in speaking of those which remain to be described; and as it
is generally found to be so convenient, whenever it is possible it will
be adhered to.In order to carry out these principles, the division proposed for this
part of the subject is—

1st.To begin the history of Christian Art by tracing up the successive
developments of the earliest perfected style, the Byzantine, in the
countries lying to the eastward of the boundary line already defined.Owing to the greater uniformity of race, the thread of the narrative is
far more easily followed to the eastward than we shall find to the
westward of the line.The Byzantine empire remained one and undivided
during the Middle Ages; and from that we pass by an easy gradation to
Russia, where the style continued to be practised till Peter the Great
superseded it by introducing the styles of Western Europe.To treat of the early Christian style as it prevailed in Italy,
down to the age of Charlemagne, so long, in fact, as it remained a
debased Roman style influenced only by its connection with the Eastern
Empire.Continuing our description of the various phases of the style as
practised in Italy and in Istria and Dalmatia (the two countries with
which she was so intimately connected) down to the revival of classic
architecture: subdividing it into those sections which are suggested by
the predominant influence of Lombardic, Byzantine, or Gothic art, and
keeping as far as possible to a chronological sequence.To take up the Romanesque style in France, and to follow it through
its various phases whilst it was being gradually absorbed in the
predominant impetus given to its successor, the Gothic style, by the
adoption of the pointed arch in intersecting vaulting during the 12th
century, and then its subsequent development in succeeding centuries,
till it perished under Francis I.

If this arrangement is not quite logical, it is certainly convenient, as
it enables us to grasp the complete history of the style in the country
where most of the more important features were invented and perfected.Having once mastered the history of Gothic art in the country of its
birth, the sequence in which the other branches of the style are
followed become comparatively unimportant.The difficulty of arranging
them does not lie so much in the sequence as in the determination of
what divisions shall be considered as separate architectural provinces.In a handbook, subdivision could hardly be carried too far; in a
history, a wider view ought to be taken.On the whole, perhaps, the
following will best meet the true exigencies of the case:—

4th.Belgium and Holland should be taken up after France as a separate
province during the Middle Ages, while at the same time forming an
intermediate link between that country and Germany.Though not without important ethnographical distinctions, it will
be convenient to treat all the German-speaking countries from the Alps
to the Baltic as one province.If Germany were taken up before France,
such a mode of treatment would be inadmissible; but following the
history of the art in that country, it may be done without either
confusion or needless repetition.Scandinavia follows naturally as a subordinate, and, unfortunately,
not very important, architectural subdivision.From this we pass by an easy gradation to the British Islands,
which in themselves contain three tolerably well-defined varieties of
style, popularly known as the Saxon, the Norman, or round-arched, and
the Gothic, or pointed-arched style of Architecture.Spain might have been made to follow France, as most of its
architectural peculiarities were borrowed from that country; but some
too own a German origin, while on the whole the new lessons to be
learned from a study of her art are so few, that it is comparatively
unimportant in what sequence the country is taken, and therefore it has
been found more convenient to place her last.BOOK I.

The term Byzantine has of late years been so loosely and incorrectly
used—especially by French writers on architecture—that it is now
extremely difficult to restrict it to the only style to which it really
belongs.Wherever a certain amount of  decoration is employed,
or a peculiar form of carving found, the name Byzantine is applied to
churches on the Rhine or in France; although no similar ornaments are
found in the Eastern Empire, and though no connection can be traced
between the builders of the Western churches and the architects of
Byzantium, or the countries subject to her sway.Strictly speaking, the term ought only to be applied to the style of
architecture which arose in Byzantium and the East after Constantine
transferred the government of the Roman Empire to that city.It is
especially the style of the Greek Church as contradistinguished from
that of the Roman Church, and ought never to be employed for anything
beyond its limits.The only obstacle to confining it to this definition
occurs between the ages of Constantine and Justinian.Up to the reign of
the last-named monarch the separation between the two churches was not
complete or clearly defined, and the architecture was of course likewise
in a state of transition, sometimes inclining to one style, sometimes to
the other.After Justinian’s time, the line may be clearly and sharply
drawn, and it would therefore be extremely convenient if the term “Greek
architecture” could be used for the style of the Greek Church from that
time to the present day.If that term be inadmissible, the term “Sclavonic” might be applied,
though only in the sense in which the Gothic style could be designated
as Teutonic.Both, however, imply ethnographic distinctions which it
would not be easy to sustain.The term “Gothic” happily avoids these,
and so would “Greek,” but for the danger of its being confounded with
“Grecian,” which is the proper name for the classical style of the
ancient Greeks.If the employment of either of these terms is deemed
inadvisable, it will be necessary to divide the style into Old and New
Byzantine—the first comprehending the three centuries of transition that
elapsed from Constantine to the Persian war of Heraclius and the rise of
the Mahomedan power, which entirely changed the face of the Eastern
Empire,—the second, or Neo-Byzantine, including all those forms which
were practised in the East from the reappearance of the style, in or
after the 8th century, till it was superseded by the Renaissance.Thus divided, the true or old Byzantine style might be regarded as the
counterpart of the early Romanesque or debased Roman style, except that,
owing to the rapid development in the East, the former culminated in the
erection of Sta.532-558); the Eastern Empire thus forming
a style of its own of singular beauty and perfection, which it left to
its Sclavonic successors to use or abuse as their means or tastes
dictated.The Western Empire, on the contrary, was in a state of decay
ending in a _débâcle_, from which the Romanesque style only partially
emerged during the reign of Charlemagne and his successors with a new
revival in the 11th century.Though the styles of the East and the West became afterwards so
distinctly separate, we must not lose sight of the fact, that during the
age of transition (324-622) no clear line of demarcation can be traced.Constantinople, Rome, and Ravenna were only principal cities of one
empire, throughout the whole of which the people were striving
simultaneously to convert a Pagan into a Christian style, and working
from the same basis with the same materials.[215] Prior to the age of
Constantine one style pervaded the whole empire.The buildings at
Palmyra, Jerash, or Baalbec, are barely distinguishable from those of
the capital, and the problem of how the Pagan style could be best
converted to Christian uses was the same for all.The consequence is,
that if we were at present writing a history which stopped with the
beginning of the 7th century, the only philosophical mode of treating
the question would be to consider the style as one and indivisible for
that period; but as the separation was throughout steadily, though
almost imperceptibly, making its way, and gradually became fixed and
permanent, it will be found more convenient to assume the separation
from the beginning.This method will no doubt lead to some repetition,
but that is a small inconvenience compared with the amount of clearness
obtained.At the same time, if any one were writing a history of
Byzantine architecture only, it would be necessary to include Ravenna,
and probably Venice and some other towns in Italy and Sicily, in the
Eastern division.On the other hand, in a history devoted exclusively to
the Romanesque styles, it would be impossible to omit the churches at
Jerusalem, Bethlehem, or Thessalonica, and elsewhere in the East.Under
these circumstances, it is necessary to draw an arbitrary line
somewhere; and for this purpose the western limits of the Turkish Empire
and of Russia will answer every practical purpose.Eastward of this line
every country in which the Christian religion at any time prevailed may
be considered as belonging to the Byzantine province.During the first three centuries of the style (324-622) it will be
convenient to consider the whole Christian East as one architectural
province.When our knowledge is more complete, it may be possible to
separate it into several, but at present we are only beginning to see
the steps by which the style grew up, and are still very far from the
knowledge requisite for such limitations, even if it should hereafter be
discovered that a sufficient number exist.All the great churches with
which Constantine and his immediate successors adorned their new capital
have perished.Like the churches at Jerusalem and Bethlehem, they were
probably constructed with wooden roofs and even wooden architraves, and
thus soon became a prey to the flames in that most combustible of
capitals.Christian architecture has been entirely swept off the face of
the earth at Antioch, and very few and imperfect vestiges are found of
the seven churches of Asia Minor.Still, the recent researches of De
Vogüé in Northern Syria,[216] and of Texier in Thessalonica[217] show
how much unexpected wealth still remains to be explored, and in a few
years more this chapter of our history may assume a shape as much more
complete than what is now written, as it excels what we were compelled
to be content with when the Handbook was published, 1855.Since therefore, under present circumstances, no ethnographic treatment
of the subject seems feasible, the clearest mode of presenting it will
probably be to adopt one purely technical.For this purpose it will be found convenient, first, to separate the
Neo-Byzantine style from the older division, which, in order not to
multiply terms, may be styled the Byzantine _par excellence_; the first
chapter extending from Constantine, 324, to the Hejira, 622; and the
second from that time to the end of the Middle Ages.In reference to the ecclesiastical architecture of the first division,
it is proposed to treat—

First, of churches of the basilican or rectangular forms, subdividing
them into those having wooden, and those having stone roofs.Secondly, to describe circular churches in the same manner, subdividing
them similarly into those with wooden roofs, and those with stone roofs
or true domes.This subdivision will not be necessary in speaking of the Neo-Byzantine
churches, since they all have stone roofs and true domes.With regard to civil or domestic architecture very little can at present
be said, as so little is known regarding it, but we may hope that, a few
years hence, materials will exist for an interesting chapter on even
this branch of the subject.Churches at Bethlehem, Jerusalem, and Thessalonica—Rectangular Churches
  in Syria and Asia Minor, with wooden roofs and stone vaults.Basilicas may be subdivided into two classes—that in which the nave is
divided from the side-aisles by pillars, carrying either entablatures or
arches, as the most purely Romanesque—and that which has piers
supporting arches only, and is transitional between the first style and
the more original forms which were elaborated out of it.Of the former class one of the most authentic and perfect is that
erected at Bethlehem by Helena, the mother of Constantine, in front of
the cave of the Nativity.The nave seems to be a nearly unaltered
example of this age, with the advantage over the contemporary churches
at Rome, that all its pillars and their capitals were made for the
places they occupy, whereby the whole possesses a completeness and
justness of proportion not found in the metropolis.Its dimensions,
though sufficient for effect, are not large, being internally 103 ft.The choir with its three apses does
not seem to be part of the original arrangement, but to have been added
by Justinian when he renovated—Eutychius says rebuilt—the church.My
impression is that a detached circular building, external to the
basilica, originally contained the entrance to the cave.The frescoes
were added apparently in the 11th or 12th century.[218]

One of the principal points of interest connected with this church is,
that it enables us to realise the description Eusebius gives us of the
basilica which Constantine erected at Jerusalem in honour of the
Resurrection.Like this church it was five-aisled, but had galleries;
the apse also was on a larger scale than could well have been possible
in the Bethlehem church, and adorned with twelve pillars, symbolical of
the Apostles.Of this building nothing now remains, and the only portion which could
be claimed as part of Constantine’s work is the western wall of the
Rotunda, which to a height of 15 to 20 ft.was cut out of the solid rock
in order to isolate the Holy Sepulchre in the centre.The so-called
tombs of Absalom and Zachariah in the valley of Jehoshaphat were
detached in a similar way from the rock behind them.[219]


                             THESSALONICA.Eski Djuma, Thessalonica.As before mentioned, it is to Constantinople, or Alexandria, or Antioch,
that we should naturally look to supply us with examples of the style of
the early transition, but as these fail, it is to Thessalonica alone—in
so far as we now know—that we can turn.In that city there are two
ancient examples.One, now known as the Eski Djuma or old mosque
(Woodcut No.274), may belong to the 5th century, though there are no
very exact data by which to fix its age.It consists of a nave,
measuring, exclusive of narthex and bema, 93 ft.across by 120 ft.—very
much the proportion of the Bethlehem church, but having only three
aisles, the centre one 48 ft.Demetrius, is larger, but less simple.It is five-aisled, has two
internal transepts, and various adjuncts.Altogether it seems a
considerable advance towards the more complicated form of a Christian
church.Both these churches have capacious galleries, running above the
side aisles, and probably devoted to the accommodation of the women.Demetrius is most probably among the first years of the
sixth century.[220] The general ordinance of the columns will be
understood from the woodcut (No.Generally they are placed on
elevated square or octagonal bases, or pedestals, as in the tepidaria of
the Thermæ in Rome, and all have a block (known as the dosseret), placed
above the capital, which is supposed to represent the entablature of the
Roman example, but is probably an original feature inserted over the
capital to support the springing of the arch.In this form it is found
very generally in the 5th and 6th centuries, after which it fell into
disuse, an increased depth being given to the abacus of the capital to
take its place.Demetrius at Thessalonica, A.D.So far as we now know, there is only one church of this class at
Constantinople—that known as St.John Studius,—a three-aisled basilica,
125 ft.Its date appears to be tolerably
well ascertained as A.D.463, and from this circumstance, as well as its
being in the metropolis, it shows less deviation from the classical type
than the provincial examples just quoted.The lower range of columns
supporting the gallery still retain the classical outline and support a
horizontal entablature (Woodcut No.277); the upper supporting arches
have very little resemblance to the classical type, and are wanting in
the architrave block or dosseret, which in fact never seems to have been
admired in the capital.The country where—so far at least as we at present know—the Byzantine
Basilica was principally developed was Northern Syria.Already in De
Vogüé’s work on Central Syria some dozen churches are indicated having
the aisles divided from the naves by pillars supporting arches.One of
these only—that at Soueideh—has five aisles, all the rest three.Almost
all have plain semicircular apses, sometimes only seen internally, like
those mentioned further on (page 510), but sometimes also projecting, as
was afterwards universally the fashion.Two at least have square
terminations (Kefr Kileh and Behioh), but this seems exceptional.Most
of them are almost the size of our ordinary parish churches—100 ft.by
60 or thereabouts—and all belong to the three centuries—the 4th, 5th,
and 6th—of which this chapter especially treats.The church at Baquoza may serve as a type of the class both in plan and
section (Woodcuts Nos.by 105; and besides the narthex—not shown in the section—it has four
lateral porches.It has also two square chapels or vestries at the end
of the aisles—an arrangement almost universal in these churches.The most remarkable of the group, however, is that of St.Simeon
Stylites, at Kalat Sema’n, about 20 miles east of Antioch.Its
dimensions are very considerable, being 330 ft.long, north and south,
and as nearly as may be, 300 ft.east and west, across what may be
called the transepts.The centre is occupied by a great octagon, 93 ft.across, on a rock in the centre of which the pillar of that eccentric
saint originally stood.This apparently was never roofed over, but stood
always exposed to the air of heaven.[221]

[Illustration: 278.Plan of Church and Part of Monastic Buildings at
Kalat Sema’n.The greater part of the conventual buildings belonging to this church
still remain in a state of completeness,—a fact which will be startling
to those who are not aware how many of the great religious
establishments of Syria still stand entire, wanting only the roofs,
which were apparently the only parts constructed of wood.The whole of the buildings at Kalat Sema’n seem to have been completed
within the limits of the 5th century, and not to have been touched or
altered since they were deserted, apparently in consequence of the
Mahomedan irruption in the 7th century.The most curious point is that
such a building should have remained so long in such a situation,
unknown to the Western world; for the notices hitherto published have
been meagre and unsatisfactory in the extreme, and De Vogüé is only able
to state that it was visited and described by the historian Evagrius in
the year 560 A.D.In the same province we find also the earliest examples of the use of
pier arches in a church to separate the nave from the aisles.These seem
to have been currently used in Northern Syria in the 6th century, though
not found in the West—at least not used in the same manner—for several
centuries later.Generally three such arches only were employed in the
length of the nave, and they consequently left the floor so open and
free, that it is very questionable if in churches of limited dimensions
the introduction of a much larger number by the Gothic architects was an
improvement.Taking it altogether, it is probable that such a church as
that at Roueiha (Woodcut No.282) would, if literally reproduced, make a
better and cheaper church for an English parish than the Mediæval models
we are so fond of copying.A considerable amount of perspective effect
is obtained by throwing two transverse arches across the nave, dividing
it into three compartments, each including four windows in the
clerestory; and the whole design is simple and solid in a degree seldom
surpassed in buildings of its class.In many of these churches the transverse arches of the nave are omitted;
and when, as at Qalb Louzeh (Woodcut No.284), the clerestory is
accentuated by roofing shafts, the same effect of perspective is
obtained by other means, and perhaps as successfully.It is very
interesting, however, to find that as early as the 6th century the
architects were thoughtfully feeling their way towards those very
principles of design which many centuries afterwards enabled the Gothic
architects to produce their most successful effects.The introduction of
four windows over each great arch, and of a rooting-shaft between each
to support the beams of the roof, was a happy thought, and it is
wonderful it was so completely lost sight of afterwards.Plan of Church at Qalb Louzeh.Apse of Church at Qalb Louzeh.It is probable that the apse (Woodcut No.284) was originally adorned
with paintings or mosaics, or at least that it was intended it should be
so ornamented; but even as it is, it is so well proportioned to the size
of the church, and to its position, and so appropriately ornamented,
that it is better than most of those found in Roman basilicas; and, for
a small church, is a more dignified receptacle for the altar than either
the French chevet or the English chancel.Did our limits admit of it, it would be not only pleasant but
instructive to dwell longer on this subject; for few parts of our
inquiry can be more interesting than to find that, as early as the 6th
century, the Roman basilica had been converted into a Christian church,
complete in all its details, and—internally at least—in a style of
architecture as consistent and almost as far removed from its classical
prototype as the Mediæval Gothic itself.Externally, too, the style was becoming independent of classical models,
though hardly in the same degree.The porches of the churches were
generally formed in two storeys, the lower having a large central arch
of admission, the upper consisting of a colonnade which partially hid,
while it supported, an open screen of windows that admitted a flood of
light into the nave just in the position where it was most effective.Without glass or mullions such a range of windows must have appeared
weak, and would have admitted rain; but when sheltered by a screen of
pillars, it was both convenient and artistic.Elevation of Chapel at Babouda.This mode of lighting is better illustrated at Babouda, where it is
employed in its simplest form.No light is admitted to the chapel except
through one great semicircular window over the entrance, and this is
protected externally by a screen of columns.This mode of introducing
light, as we shall afterwards see, was common in India at this age, and
earlier, all the Chaitya caves being lighted in the same manner; and for
artistic effect it is equal, if not superior, to any other which has yet
been invented.The light is high, and behind the worshipper, and thrown
direct on the altar, or principal part of the church.In very large
buildings it could hardly be applied, but for smaller ones it is
singularly effective.The external effect of these buildings though not so original as the
interior, is still very far removed from the classical type, and
presents a variety of outline and detail very different from the
simplicity of a Pagan temple.One of the most complete is that at
Tourmanin (Woodcut No.287), though that at Qalb Louzeh is nearly as
perfect, but simpler in detail.For a church of the 6th century it is
wonderful how many elements of later buildings it suggests; even the
western towers seem to be indicated, and, except the four columns of the
gallery, there is very little to recall the style out of which it arose.Façade of Church at Tourmanin.There are considerable remains of a wooden-roofed basilica at Pergamus,
which may be even older than those just described; but having been built
in brick, and only faced with stone—the whole of which is gone—it is
difficult to feel sure of the character of its details and mouldings.It
had galleries on either side of the nave, but how these were supported
or framed is not clear.It may have been by wooden posts or marble
pillars, and these would have either decayed or been removed.The two
square calcidica or vestries, which in the Syrian churches terminate the
side-aisles, are here placed externally like transepts, and beyond them
are two circular buildings with domical roofs and square apses.What
their use was is, however, doubtful.In fact, we know so little of the
architecture of that age in Asia Minor that this building stands quite
exceptionally; and very little use can be made of it, either as throwing
light on other buildings, or as receiving illustration from their
peculiarities.But seeing how much has been effected in this direction
of late, we may fully hope that this state of isolation will not long
remain.One other church of the 4th century is known to exist—at Nisibin.It is
a triple church, the central compartment being the tomb of the founder,
the first Armenian bishop of the place.Though much ruined, it still
retains the mouldings of its doorways and windows as perfect as when
erected, the whole being of fine hard stone.These are identical in
style with the buildings of Diocletian at Spalato; and as their date is
well known, they will, when published, form a valuable contribution to
the information we now possess regarding the architecture of this
period.CHURCHES WITH STONE ROOFS.All the buildings above described—with the exception of the chapel at
Babouda—have wooden roofs, as was the case generally with the basilicas
and the temples of the classical age.The Romans, however, had built
temples with aisles and vaulted them as early as the age of Augustus, as
at Nîmes, for instance (Woodcut No.189), and they had roofed their
largest basilicas and baths with intersecting vaults.We should not
therefore feel surprised if the Christians sometimes attempted the same
thing in their rectangular churches, more especially as the dome was
always a favourite mode of roofing circular buildings; and the problem
which the Byzantine architects of the day set themselves to solve was—as
we shall presently see—how to fit a circular dome of masonry to a
rectangular building.One of the earliest examples of a stone-roofed church is that at Tafkha
in the Hauran.It is probably of the age of Constantine, though as
likely to be before his time as after it.Its date, however, is not of
very great importance, as its existence does not prove that the form was
adopted from choice by the Christians: the truth being that, in the
country where it is found, wood was never used as a building material.All the buildings, both domestic and public, are composed wholly of
stone—the only available material for the purpose which the country
afforded.In consequence of this, when that tide of commercial
prosperity which rose under the Roman rule flowed across the country
from the Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, the inhabitants had
recourse to a new mode of construction, which was practically a new
style of architecture.This consisted in the employment of arches
instead of beams.These were placed so near one another that flat stones
could be laid side by side from arch to arch.Over these a layer of
concrete was spread, and a roof was thus formed so indestructible that
whole towns remain perfect to the present day, as originally constructed
in the first centuries of the Christian era.[222]

[Illustration: 289.Section on A B, Tafkha.Section on C D, Tafkha.]Half Front Elevation, Tafkha.One example must suffice to explain this curious mode of construction.The church at Tafkha is 50 ft.It is
spanned by four arches, 7 ft.On each side are galleries of
flat slabs resting on brackets, as shown in Woodcuts Nos.289, 291,
which again are supported by smaller transverse arches.At one side is a
tower, but this is roofed wholly by bracketing, as if the architect
feared the thrust of the arch even at that height.The defect of this arrangement as an architectural expedient is the
extreme frequency of the piers, 8 or 10 ft.being the greatest distance
practicable; but as a mechanical expedient it is singularly ingenious.More internal space is obtained with a less expenditure of material and
danger from thrust than from any mode of construction—wholly of
stone—that we are acquainted with; and with a little practice it might
no doubt be much improved upon.The Indian architects, as we shall
presently see, attempted the same thing, but set about it in a
diametrically opposite way.They absolutely refused to employ the arch
under any circumstances, but bracketed forward till the space to be
covered was so limited that a single stone would reach across.By this
means they were enabled to roof spaces 20 or 25 ft.span without arches,
which is about the interval covered with their aid at Tafkha.[223]

[Illustration: 293.Another circumstance which renders these Hauran examples interesting to
the architectural student is that they contain no trace or reminiscence
of wooden construction or adornment, so apparent in almost every other
style.In Egypt, in Greece, in India, in
Persia—everywhere, in fact—we can trace back the principal form of
decoration to a wooden original; here alone all is lithic, and it is
probably the only example of the sort that the whole history of
architecture affords.If there are any churches in the Byzantine province of the age of which
we are treating, whose naves are roofed by intersecting vaults, they
have not yet been described in any accessible work; but great
tunnel-vaults have been introduced into several with effect.One such is
found at Hierapolis, on the borders of Phrygia (Woodcut No.It is
divided by a bold range of piers into three aisles, the centre one
having a clear width of 45 ft.The internal dimensions of the
church are 177 ft.There are three great piers in the length,
which carry bold transverse ribs so as to break the monotony of the
vault, and have between them secondary arches, to carry the galleries.There is another church at the same place, the roof of which is of a
somewhat more complicated form.The internal length, 140 ft., is divided
into three by transverse arches; but its great peculiarity is that the
vault is cut into by semi-circular lunettes above the screen side-walls,
and through these the light is introduced.This arrangement will be
understood from the section (Woodcut No.Taken altogether, there
is probably no other church of its age and class in which the vault is
so pleasingly and artistically arranged, and in which the mode of
introducing the light is so judicious and effective.The age of these two last churches is not very well ascertained.They
probably belong to the 5th, and are certainly not later than the 6th,
century; but, before we can speak with certainty on the subject, more
examples must be brought to light and examined.From our present
knowledge it can hardly be doubted that a sufficient number do exist to
complete the chapter; and it is to be hoped they will be published,
since a history of vaults in the East, independent of domes, is still a
desideratum.CIRCULAR OR DOMICAL BUILDINGS.Circular Churches with wooden roofs and with true domes in Syria and
  Thessalonica—Churches of St.Sergius and Bacchus and Sta.Sophia,
  Constantinople—Domestic Architecture—Tombs.At the time of the erection of the churches described in the last
chapter, a circular domical style was being simultaneously elaborated in
the East, which not only gave a different character to the whole style,
but eventually entirely superseded the western basilican form, and
became an original and truly Byzantine art.Constantine is said to have erected a church at Antioch which, from the
description given by Eusebius, was octagonal in plan.On Mount Gerizim, on or near the site of the Samaritan temple, Justinian
built an octagonal church showing in its multifold chapels a
considerable advance towards Christian arrangements; it has, however
been so completely destroyed that only its foundation can now be traced,
from which the plan (Woodcut No.296) was measured and worked out by Sir
Charles Wilson.At Bosra in the Hauran there is a church of perfectly well-ascertained
date—A.D.512—which, when more completely illustrated, will throw
considerable light on the steps by which a Pagan temple was transformed
into a Christian church.It is a building externally square, but
internally circular (Woodcut No.in
diameter, and was evidently covered with a wooden roof, according to M.
de Vogüé, supported on eight piers.The interest of the plan consists in
its showing the progress made in adapting this form to Christian
purposes, and it is to be hoped that further investigation may enable us
to supply all the steps by which the transformation took place.De Vogüé
is of opinion that there was a central dome carried on piers and columns
similar to the church of SS.Sergius and Bacchus in Constantinople, with
aisles round and gallery over them, the latter covered with a timber
roof, the holes in which the rafters were fixed being still visible.Owing to want of lateral support the dome fell down, and at a later
period a small basilica church was erected within the enclosure in front
of the apse; the proximity of the piers of this church suggests that it
was covered with stone slabs according to the custom of the country.The
inscription over the principal entrance door states that the church was
dedicated to SS.Sergius and Bacchus, and was completed in the 400th
year of Bosra (511-512 A.D.).Another example exists at Kalat Sema’n, in
Northern Syria, and presents a combination of an octagonal with a
rectangular church very common in Armenia and Georgia.As is generally
the case there, they are very small in dimensions, the whole group only
measuring 120 ft.Their actual destination is not known, but M.
de Vogüé suggests that the triapsal arrangement in the octagonal
building points to its having been erected as a baptistery.This group
is situated about 200 yards from the main buildings illustrated in
Woodcut (No.Section of Double Church at Kalat Sema’n.Plan, Kalat Sema’n.Whether the dome of the Pantheon at Rome (p.320) was erected in the
time of the Antonines, or before the time of Augustus, as was formerly
supposed, it is evident that the Romans had conquered the difficulties
of domic construction long before the transference of the seat of power
to Byzantium; the Pantheon being, up to this hour, the largest (single)
dome ever constructed by the hand of man.Simple and grand as it
undoubtedly is, it had several glaring defects in its design which the
Byzantines set themselves to remedy.The first was that twice the
necessary amount of materials was consumed in its construction.The
second, that the mode of lighting by a hole in the roof, which also
admitted the rain and the snow, was most objectionable before the
invention of glass.The third, that a simply circular plan is always
unmeaning and inconvenient.A fourth, that a circular building can
hardly, by any contrivance, be made to fit on to any other buildings or
apartments.In the Minerva Medica (Woodcut No.229) great efforts were made, but not
quite successfully, to remedy these defects.The building would not fit
on to any others, and, though an improvement on the design of the
Pantheon, was still far from perfect.The first step the Byzantines made was to carry the dome on arches
resting on eight piers enclosing an octagon A (Woodcut No.300); this
enabled them to obtain increased space, to provide nave, choir, and
transepts, and by throwing out niches on the diagonal lines, virtually
to obtain a square hall in the centre.The difference between the
octagon and circle is so slight, that by corbelling out above the
extrados of the arches, a circular base for the dome was easily obtained
B. The next step was to carry the dome on arches resting on four piers,
and their triumph was complete when by the introduction of
pendentives—represented by the shaded parts at D (Woodcut No.301), they
were enabled to place the circular dome on a square compartment.The
pendentives and dome thus projected formed part of a sphere, the radius
of which was the half-diagonal of the square compartment.Constructively
it would probably have been easier to roof the space by an intersecting
vault; and even if of 100 or 150 ft.span it would without difficulty
have been effected.The difference between the intersecting vault and
the dome (as shown in Woodcuts 302 and 303; the former the tomb of Galla
Placidia, built 450 A.D., the latter the chapel of St.Peter Crysologus
attached to the archiepiscopal palace of about the same date, and both
in Ravenna) is perhaps the most striking contrast the history of
architecture affords between mechanical and ornamental construction.Both are capable of being ornamented to the same extent and in the same
manner; but the difference of form rendered the dome a beautiful object
in itself wholly irrespective of ornament, whereas the same cannot
always be said of the intersecting barrel vault.Altogether, the effect
would have been architecturally so infinitely inferior, that we cannot
but feel grateful to the Byzantines that they persevered, in spite of
all mechanical temptations, till they reached the wonderful perfection
of the dome of Sta.Tomb of Galla Placidia, Ravenna.Chapel in Archiepiscopal Palace, Ravenna.]Among the earliest domical churches found in the East is that of St.It is also, perhaps, the finest example of its
class belonging strictly to that group which has been designated above
as the Eastern Romanesque.As will be seen from the plan it is a circular apartment, 79 ft.in
diameter, surrounded by walls 20 ft.in thickness, into which are cut
seven great niches; two apparently serving as entrances, opposite one of
which is a bema or presbytery of considerable importance and purely
Christian form.The dome is hemispherical, pierced at its base by eight
semi-circular lunettes, and externally covered and concealed by a wooden
roof.This form of roof is first found in the West at Nocera dei Pagani
(p.547), but the dome there is only half the diameter of this one, and
of a very different form and construction.George’s
retains its internal decorations, which are among the earliest as well
as the most interesting Christian mosaics in existence.[224] The
architecture presented in them bears about the same relation to that in
the Pompeiian frescoes which the Jacobæan does to classical
architecture, and, mixed with Christian symbols and representations of
Christian saints, makes up a most interesting example of early Christian
decoration.(From
Texier and Pullan.)]No inscriptions or historical indications exist from which the date of
the church can be fixed.We are safe, however, in asserting that it was
erected by Christians, for Christian purposes, subsequently to the age
of Constantine.If we assume the year 400 as an approximate date we
shall probably not err to any great extent, though the real date may be
somewhat later.Plan of Kalybe at Omm-es-Zeitoun (Syria).How early a true Byzantine form of arrangement may have been introduced
we have no means of knowing; but as early as the year 285—according to
De Vogüé—we have a Kalybe[225] at Omm-es-Zeitoun, which contains all the
elements of the new style.It is square in plan, with a circular dome in
its centre for a roof.The wing walls which extend the façade are
curious, but not singular.One other example, at least, is found in the
Hauran, at Chaqqa, and there may be many more.View of Kalybe at Omm-es-Zeitoun.Still, in the Hauran they never seem quite to have fallen into the true
Byzantine system of construction, but preferred one less mechanically
difficult, even at the expense of crowding the floor with piers.In the
church at Ezra, for instance, the internal octagon is reduced to a
figure of sixteen sides before it is attempted to put a dome upon it,
and all thought of beauty of form, either internally or externally, is
abandoned in order to obtain mechanical stability—although the dome is
only 30 ft.As the date of this church is perfectly ascertained (510) it forms a
curious landmark in the style just anterior to the great efforts
Justinian was about to make, and which forced it so suddenly into its
greatest, though a short-lived, degree of perfection.As before mentioned, all the churches of the capital which were erected
before the age of Justinian, have perished, with the one exception of
that of St.This may in part be
owing to the hurried manner in which they were constructed, and the
great quantity of wood consequently employed, which might have risked
their destruction anywhere.It is, however, a curious, but
architecturally an important, fact that Byzantium possessed every
conceivable title to be chosen as the capital of the Empire, except the
possession of a good building-stone, or even apparently any suitable
material for making good bricks.Wood seems in all times to have been
the material most readily obtained and most extensively used for
building purposes, and hence the continual recurrence of fires, from
before the time of Justinian down to the present day.That monarch was
the first who fairly met the difficulty; the two churches erected during
his reign, which now exist, are constructed wholly without wood or
combustible materials of any sort—and hence their preservation.The earliest of these two, popularly known as the “Kutchuk Agia Sophia,”
or lesser Sta.Sophia, was originally a double church, or more properly
speaking two churches placed side by side, precisely in the same manner
as the two at Kalat Sema’n (Woodcut No.The basilica was dedicated
to the Apostles Peter and Paul; the domical church, appropriately, to
the Martyrs Sergius and Bacchus.The former has entirely disappeared,
from which I would infer that it was constructed with pillars and a
wooden roof.[226] The latter remains very nearly intact.The frescoes
and mosaics have, indeed, disappeared from the body of the church,
hidden, it is to be hoped, under the mass of whitewash which covers its
walls—in the narthex they can still be distinguished.The existing church is nearly square in plan, being 109 ft.by 92 over
all, exclusive of the apse, and covering only about 10,000 sq.It
has consequently no pretensions to magnificence on the score of
dimensions, but is singularly elegant in design and proportion.Internally, the arrangement of the piers of the dome, of the galleries,
and of the pillars which support them, are almost identical with those
of St.Vitale at Ravenna, but the proportions of the Eastern example are
better, being 66 ft.in height by 52 in diameter, while the other, with
the same diameter, is nearly 20 ft.higher, and consequently too tall to
be pleasing.The details of this church are generally well designed for the purposes
to which they are applied.There is a certain reminiscence of classical
feeling in the mouldings and foliage—in the latter, however, very faint.313) here seems almost to have superseded the
capital, and what was once a classical entablature has retained very
little of its pristine form (No.314), and indeed was used
constructively only, for the support of a gallery, or some such
mechanical requirement.The arch had entirely superseded it as an
ornamental feature long before the age of Justinian.Although the building just described, and others that might be quoted,
probably contain the germs of all that is found in Sta.Sophia, they are
on so small a scale that it is startling to find Justinian attempting an
edifice so grand, and so daring in construction, without more experience
than he appears to have obtained.Indeed so exceptional does this great
structure appear, with our present knowledge, that we might almost feel
inclined at first sight to look upon it as the immediate creation of the
individual genius of its architect, Anthemius of Thralles; but there can
be little doubt that if a greater number of contemporary examples
existed we should be able to trace back every feature of the design to
its origin.The scale, however, on which it was carried out was
certainly original, and required great boldness on the part of the
architect to venture upon such a piece of magnificence.At all events,
the celebrated boast of its founder on contemplating his finished work
was more than justified.When Justinian exclaimed, “I have surpassed
thee, O Solomon,” he took an exaggerated view of the work of his
predecessor, and did not realize the extent to which his building
excelled the Jewish temple.The latter was only equal to a small church
with a wooden roof supported by wooden posts, and covering some 7200 sq.Sophia covers ten times that area, is built of durable
materials throughout, and far more artistically ornamented than the
temple of the Jews ever could have been.But Justinian did more than
accomplish this easy victory.Neither the Pantheon nor any of the
vaulted halls at Rome equal the nave of Sta.Sophia in extent, or in
cleverness of construction, or in beauty of design.Nor was there
anything erected during the ten centuries which elapsed from the
transference of the capital to Byzantium till the building of the great
mediæval cathedrals which can be compared with it.Indeed it remains
even now an open question whether a Christian church exists anywhere, of
any age, whose interior is so beautiful as that of this marvellous
creation of old Byzantine art.Sophia which had been erected by Constantine
was, it seems, burnt to the ground in the fifth year of Justinian, A.D.532, when he determined to re-erect it on the same spot with more
magnificence and with less combustible materials.So rapidly were the
works pushed forward, that in six years it was ready for dedication,
A.D.Twenty years afterwards a portion of the dome fell down in
consequence of an earthquake; but this damage was repaired, and the
church re-dedicated, A.D.563, in the form, probably very nearly, in
which we now find it.In plan it closely approaches an exact square, being 235 ft.north and
south by 250 east and west, exclusive of the narthex and apse.The
narthex itself is a splendid hall, 205 ft.Beyond this there is an exo-narthex
which runs round the whole of the outer court, but this hardly seems to
be part of the original design.Altogether, the building, without this
or any adjuncts which may be after-thoughts, covers about 70,000 sq.ft., or nearly the average area of a mediæval cathedral of the first
class.316) possesses little architectural
beauty beyond what is due to its mass and the varied outline arising
from the mechanical contrivances necessary to resist the thrust of its
internal construction.It may be that, like the early Christian
basilicas at Rome, it was purposely left plain to distinguish it from
the external adornment of Heathen temples, or it may have been intended
to revêt it with marble, and add the external ornament afterwards.Before we became acquainted with the ornamental exteriors of Syrian
churches, the former theory would seem the more plausible, though it can
hardly now be sustained; and when we consider that the second dedication
only took place the year before Justinian’s death, and how soon
troublous times followed, we may fairly assume that what we now see is
only an incomplete design.Whatever may be the case with the exterior,
all the internal arrangements are complete, and perfect both from a
mechanical and an artistic point of view.In such a design as this, the
first requirement was to obtain four perfectly stable arches on which
the dome might rest.The great difficulty was with the two arches
running transversely north and south.These are as nearly as may be 100
ft.span and 120 high to the crown, and 10 ft.Each of them
has a mass of masonry behind it for an abutment, 75 ft.wide, only partially pierced by arches on the ground and gallery floor;
and as the mass might have been carried to any height, it ought, if
properly constructed, to have sufficed for an arch very much wider and
more heavily weighted than that which it supports.Yet the southern wall
is considerably bulged, and the whole of that side thrown out of the
perpendicular.This probably was the effect of the earthquake which
caused the fall of the dome in 559, since no further settlement seems to
have taken place.The
distance between the solid parts of the piers was 75 ft., and this was
filled up with a screen wall supporting the inner side of the arch; so,
unless that was crushed, the whole was perfectly stable.Pendentives
between these four arches ought not to have presented any difficulties.It would, however, have been better, from an architectural point of
view, if they had been carried further up and forward, so as to hang a
weight inside the dome to counteract the outward thrust, as was
afterwards so successfully practised at Beejapore.[227] As it is, the
dome rests rather on the outer edge of the system, without sufficient
space for abutment.In itself the dome is very little lower than a
hemisphere, being 107 ft.Externally, it
would have been better if higher; for internal effect this is
sufficient.Its base is pierced by forty small windows, so small and so
low as not to interfere in any way with the apparent construction, but
affording an ample supply of light—in that climate at least—to render
every part of the dome bright and cheerful.Sophia from E. to W. Scale 100 ft.Beyond the great dome, east and west, are two semi-domes of a diameter
equal to that of the great dome, and these are again cut into by two
smaller domes, so that the building, instead of being a Greek cross, as
usually asserted, is only 100 ft.across in the centre and 125 wide
beyond the central space each way.There is a little awkwardness in the
way in which the smaller semi-domes cut into the larger, and the three
windows of the latter are unconnected with any other part of the design,
which is unpleasing, but might easily be remedied in a second attempt.These very irregularities, however, give a variety and appropriateness
to the design which has probably never been surpassed.A single dome of
the area of the central and two semi-domes would not have appeared
nearly so large, and would have overpowered everything else in the
building.As it is, the eye wanders upwards from the large arcades of
the ground floor to the smaller arches of the galleries, and thence to
the smaller semi-domes.These lead the eye on to the larger, and the
whole culminates in the great central roof.Nothing, probably, so
artistic has been done on the same scale before or since.If, however, the proportions of this church are admirable, the details
are equally so.All the pillars are of porphyry, verd antique, or
marbles of the most precious kinds.The capitals are among the most
admirable specimens of the style.It will be remembered that the
governing line of a classical Corinthian capital is a hollow curve, to
which acanthus-leaves or other projecting ornaments were applied.When
the columns were close together, and had only a beam to support, this
form of capital was sufficient; but when employed to carry the
constructive arches of the fabric its weakness became instantly
apparent.Long before Justinian’s time, the tendency became apparent to
reverse the curve and to incise the ornament.Sophia the
transition is complete; the capitals are as full as elegance would
allow, and all the surfaces are flat, with ornaments relieved by
incision.In the lower tier of arches (Woodcut No.318) this is boldly
and beautifully done, the marble being left to tell its own story.In
the upper tier, further removed from the eye, the interstices are filled
in with black marble so as to ensure the desired effect.All the flat surfaces are covered with a mosaic of marble slabs of the
most varied patterns and beautiful colours; the domes, roofs, and curved
surfaces, with a gold-grounded mosaic relieved by figures or
architectural devices.Though much of the mosaic is now concealed,
enough is left to enable the effect of the whole to be judged of, and it
certainly is wonderfully grand and pleasing.The one thing wanting is
painted glass, like that which adorns the Dome of the Rock at Jerusalem,
to render this building as solemnly impressive as it is overpoweringly
beautiful.Sophia is so essentially different from the greater number of
churches, that it is extremely difficult to institute a comparison
between them.With regard to external effect, Gothic cathedrals
generally excel it; but whether by accident or by the inherent necessity
of the style is by no means so clear.In so far as the interior is
concerned, no Gothic architect ever rose to the conception of a hall 100
ft.high, and none ever disposed
each part more artistically to obtain the effect he desired to produce.Where the Byzantine style might profit from the experience subsequently
gained by Gothic architects is in the use of mouldings.The one defect
in the decoration of Sta.Sophia is that it depends too much on colour.It would have been better if the pier-arches, the window-frames, and the
string-courses generally had been more strongly accentuated by moulding
and panellings, but this is a slight defect among so many beauties.A comparison with the great Renaissance cathedrals is more easy, but
results even more favourably to the Byzantine example.Two of these have
domes which are considerably larger—St.Paul’s, London (108), is within a
foot of the same diameter, all the rest are smaller.[228] This, however,
is of less consequence than the fact that they are all adjuncts to the
design of the church.None of them are integral or supported by the rest
of the design, and all tend to dwarf the buildings they are attached to
rather than to heighten the general effect.With scarcely an exception
also all the Renaissance cathedrals employ internally great sprawling
pillars and pilasters, designed for external use by the Romans, which
not only diminish the apparent size of the building but produce an
effect of unreality and sham utterly fatal to true art.In fact, turn it as we will, and compare it as we may with any other
buildings of its class, the verdict seems inevitable that Sta.Sophia—internally at least, for we may omit the consideration of the
exterior, as unfinished—is the most perfect and most beautiful church
which has yet been erected by any Christian people.When its furniture
was complete the verdict would probably have been still more strongly in
its favour; but so few of the buildings described in these pages retain
these adjuncts in anything like completeness that they must be withdrawn
from both sides and our remarks be confined to the architecture, and
that only.Sophia at Thessalonica, according to Greek tradition,
was built by Justinian in the latter part of his reign.[229] It is a
church of considerable dimensions, measuring 140 ft.It possesses also an
upper gallery, and its arrangements generally are well considered and
artistic.There does not seem to be any documentary evidence of its age,
but judging from the details published in Texier, the date ascribed to
it seems probable.This has been further established lately from an
inscription found in the apse, which as well as the dome still retain
their ancient mosaics; the inscription is incomplete, but Messrs.Duchesne and Bayet, in an appendix to their work on Mount Athos, ascribe
it to the second half of the 6th century.The church possesses one
special characteristic: above the pendentives is a low drum, circular
internally,[230] in which windows are pierced, but which, externally, is
carried up square: by this means the angle piers are well weighted and
are thus enabled to resist more effectually the thrust of the arches
carrying the pendentives.The two side walls also, which in Sta.Sophia
at Constantinople were built almost flush with the inner arch, leaving
outside a widely-projecting arch thrown across between the buttresses to
carry the buttresses of the dome, are here placed flush with the outside
of the arch, thus giving increased space to the interior.The publication of the Count De Vogüé’s book has enabled us to realise
the civil and domestic architecture of Syria in the 5th and 6th
centuries with a completeness that, a very short time ago, would have
been thought impossible.Owing to the fact that every part of the
buildings in the Hauran was in stone, and that they were suddenly
deserted on the Mahomedan conquest, never, apparently, to be
re-occupied, many of the houses remain perfectly entire to the present
day, and in Northern Syria only the roofs are gone.Generally they seem to have been two storeys in height, adorned with
verandahs supported by stone columns, the upper having a solid
screen-fence of stone about 3 ft.high, intended apparently as
much to secure privacy to the sleeping apartments of the house as
protection against falling out.In some instances the lower storey is
twice the height of the upper, and contained the state apartments of the
house.In others, as in that at Refadi (Woodcut No.320), it seems to
have been intended for the offices.In the plan of a house at Moudjeleia
(Woodcut No.321) the principal block of the house is in two storeys,
with portico on ground floor and verandah over.The buildings at the
back with their courtyard were probably offices, and those in front by
the side of the main entrance warehouses or stores.In some instances one is startled to find details which we are
accustomed to associate with much more modern dates; as, for instance,
this window (Woodcut No.322) from the palace at Chaqqa, which there
seems no reason whatever for doubting belongs to the 3rd
century—anterior to the time of Constantine!It looks more like the
vagary of a French architect of the age of Francis I.Plan of house at Moudjeleia.]The building known as the Golden Gateway at Jerusalem and attributed to
Justinian, bears in its details many striking resemblances to those of
the 5th and 6th centuries in Central Syria, illustrated in De Vogüé’s
book.It is situated on the east side of the Haram enclosure, and
consists of a vestibule divided by columns into two aisles of three bays
each vaulted with a cupola[231] carried on arches, between which and the
capitals of the columns is found the Byzantine dosseret already referred
to.Within the eastern doorways (said to have been blocked up by Omar)
are two huge monoliths 14 ft.respectively, the
doorposts of an earlier gateway.Externally, on the entrance fronts
(east and west), the entablature of the pilasters is carried round the
circular-headed doorways which they flank; the earliest instance of this
development is found in the Palace of Diocletian at Spalato, and there
is a second example in the Roman gateway to the Mosque of Damascus,
which probably suggested the idea to the Byzantine builders; the sharp
stiff foliage of Greek type with which the ornament is carved on the
Golden Gate agrees in style and character with that in the church of St.Demetrius at Thessalonica dating from the commencement of the 6th
century.(From a Drawing by
Catherwood.Originally published in Fisher’s ‘Oriental Album.’)]

Of similar style and character are the arch-moulds of the double gate on
the south wall of the Haram, and the cupolas of the interior vestibule,
the columns carrying them however being probably of earlier date and
possibly part of the substructure of Herod’s temple.The surface
decoration of these cupolas is similar to that found in Central Syria.The sepulchral remains of Syria, both structural and rock-cut, seem
nearly as numerous as the dwellings of the living, and are full of
interest, not only from their frequently bearing dates, but from their
presenting new types of tombs, or old types in such new forms as
scarcely to be recognizable.Roof of one of the Compartments of the Gate Huldah.The oldest example, that of Hamrath in Souideh, dates from the 1st
century B.C., and consists of a tomb 28 ft.square decorated with
semi-detached Doric columns; the roof is gone, but it was probably
covered with one of pyramidal form like the tomb of Zechariah (Woodcut
No.The tomb of Diogenes at Hass (Woodcut No.326), also square, consisted
of two storeys, with a portico on the ground storey on one side, and a
peristyle on all four sides of the upper storey, above which rose the
central walls carrying a pyramidal roof, not stepped, as in the
Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, but with projecting bosses on each stone.The same class of roof is found on other tombs, being adopted probably
as the simplest method of covering over the tomb; these tombs date from
the 4th and 5th centuries, and in all cases the sepulchral chambers
within them are vaulted with large slabs of stone carried on stone ribs.Tomb at Hass]

Besides these, there is another class of tomb apparently very numerous,
in which the sepulchral chamber is below the ground, with vaulted
entrance rising to form a podium on which columns either two or four in
number are erected;[232] in the latter case the columns bearing an
entablature with small pyramidal roof; in the former a fragment of
architrave only, the two columns being sometimes tied together one-third
of the way down by a stone band with dentils carved on it: these tombs
are, many of them, dated, and belong to the 2nd and 3rd centuries.With our present limits it is only possible to characterize generally
the main features of the Byzantine style, and to indicate the sources
from which further information may be obtained.In the present instance
it is satisfactory to find that ample materials now exist for filling up
a framework which a few years ago was almost entirely a blank.Any one
who will master the works of De Vogüé, or Texier, or Salzenberg, and
other minor publications, may easily acquire a fair knowledge of the
older Byzantine style of architecture.Once it is grasped it will
probably be acknowledged that there are few more interesting chapters
than that which explains how a perfect Christian Church like that of
Sta.Sophia was elaborated out of the classical edifices of ancient
Rome.It will also probably be found that there are few more instructive
lessons to be learnt from the study of architectural history than the
tracing of the various contrivances which were so earnestly employed,
during the first two centuries of Christian supremacy, in attaining this
result.NEO-BYZANTINE STYLE.Irene, Constantinople—Churches at Ancyra, Trabala, and
  Constantinople—Churches at Thessalonica and in Greece—Domestic
  Architecture.Santa Sophia at Constantinople was not only the grandest and most
perfect creation of the old school of Byzantine art, but it was also the
last.It seems as if the creative power of the Empire had exhausted
itself in that great effort, and for long after it the history is a
blank.We always knew that the two centuries which elapsed between the
ages of Constantine and Justinian were ages of great architectural
activity.We knew that hundreds, it may be thousands, of churches were
erected during that period.With the two subsequent centuries, however,
the case seems widely different.Shortly after Justinian’s death, the
troubles of the Empire, the Persian wars of Heraclius, and, more than
either, the rise of the Mahomedan power in the East, and of the Roman
pontificate under Gregory the Great in the West—all tended so to disturb
and depress the Byzantine kingdom as to leave little leisure and less
means for the exercise of architectural magnificence.It is therefore
hardly probable that we shall ever be in a position to illustrate the
7th and 8th centuries as we now know we can the 5th and 6th.Still,
building must have gone on, because when we again meet the style, it is
changed.One of the very earliest churches of the new school is that of
Sta.Irene at Constantinople, rebuilt as we now find it by Leo the
Isaurian (A.D.It differs in several essential particulars
from the old style, and contains the germ of much that we find
frequently repeated.The change is not so great as might have taken
place in two centuries of building activity, but it is considerable.In
this church we find, apparently for the first time in a complete form,
the new mode of introducing the light to the dome through a
perpendicular drum, which afterwards became so universal that it serves
to fix the age of a building in the East with almost as much certainty
as the presence of a pointed arch does that of a building in the West.As this invention is so important, it may be well to recapitulate the
steps by which it was arrived at.Half Section, half Elevation, of Dome of Sta.The oldest mode of lighting a dome is practised in the Pantheon (Woodcut
No.191), by simply leaving out the central portion.Artistically and
mechanically nothing could be better, but before the invention of glass
it was intolerably inconvenient whenever much rain or snow fell.A
change therefore was necessary, and it is found in the tomb or temple of
Marcellus, built during the reign of Constantine on the Via Prenestina
at Rome.It consists simply of boring four circular holes through the
dome a little above its springing.The next step is seen at Thessalonica
in the church of St.There eight semi-circular
lunettes are pierced in the dome, at its springing, and answer the
purpose very perfectly.Sophia, where
forty windows introduce a flood of light without its ever falling on the
eyes of the spectator.After this it seems to have been considered
desirable not to break the hemisphere of the dome, but to place the
windows in a perpendicular circular rim of masonry—called the drum—and
to introduce the light always through that.Externally there can be no
doubt but that this was an improvement; it gave height and dignity to
the dome in small churches, where, without this elevation, the feature
would have been lost.Internally, however, the advantage is
problematical: the separation of the dome from its pendentives destroyed
the continuity of the roof, and introduced the stilted effect so
objectionable in Renaissance domes.In the Neo-Byzantine churches the
dome became practically a skylight on the roof, the drum increasing in
height and the dome diminishing in dignity as the style progressed.As
all the churches are small, the feature is unobjectionable; but in
larger edifices it would have been found difficult to construct it, and
the artistic result would hardly have been pleasing, even had this
difficulty been got over.Be this as it may, its value as a chronometric
landmark is undoubted.As a rule it may generally be asserted that, in all Christian domes
erected during the old Byzantine period, the light is introduced by
openings in the dome itself.[233] After that time, the light is as
generally admitted through windows in the drum, the dome itself being
cut into only in the rarest possible instances.If these views are correct, the church of St.Clement at Ancyra is a
transitional specimen subsequent to Sta.Sophia, because the dome is
raised timidly (Woodcut No.328) on a low drum pierced with four small
windows; but it is anterior to Sta.Irene, because the dome is still
pierced with twelve larger windows, after the manner of Sta.All the details of its architecture, in so far as
they can be made out, bear out this description.They are further
removed from the classical type than the churches of Justinian, and the
whole plan (Woodcut No.329) is more that which the Greek church
afterwards took than any of the early churches show.Its greatest
defect—though the one most generally inherent in the style—is in its
dimensions.long, over all externally, by 58 ft.Yet this is a fair average size of a Greek church of that age.Another church, very similar, is found at Myra, dedicated to St.Clement in size, and has a double
narthex considerably larger in proportion, but so ruined that it is
difficult to make out its plan, or to ascertain whether it is a part of
the original structure, or a subsequent addition.The cupola is raised
on a drum, and altogether the church has the appearance of being much
more modern than that at Ancyra.A third church of the same class, and better preserved, is found at
Trabala in Lycia.Clement, and similar in
its arrangements to Sta.Sophia, except in the omission of the
semi-domes, which seem never to have been adopted in the provinces,[234]
and indeed may be said to be peculiar to the metropolitan church.Notwithstanding the beauty of that feature, it appears to have remained
dormant till revived by the Turks in Constantinople, and there alone.In this example there are two detached octagonal buildings, either tombs
or sacristies; a form which, except in large detached buildings, does
not seem to have been so common as the circular, till after the time of
Justinian.Returning to the capital, we find one other remarkable peculiarity of
the Neo-Byzantine style in the attempt to allow the external surface of
an ordinary tunnel-vault to retain its form without any ridge whatever.It can hardly be doubted that this is artistically a mistake.With domes
it was early felt to be so, and consequently we always find a flower or
pinnacle in iron, or some such ornament, marking the centre.In this the
Saracenic architects were especially successful—all their domes possess
a central ornament sufficient to relieve them, and generally of the most
beautiful proportions.With the extrados of a circular vault, however,
it is even worse than with a dome.A roof is felt to be a contrivance to
keep off the rain.It may be more or less sloping, according to the
materials of which it is constructed; but to make one part of each ridge
sloping, and the central portion flat, is a discord that offends the
eye, besides looking weak and unmeaning.A pointed arch would avoid the
evil, but a reverse or ogee curve is perhaps the most pleasing.In the
Neo-Byzantine age, however, between the 8th and the 12th centuries, the
eye seems to have got accustomed to it.It is common in the East,
especially at Constantinople and at Venice.Mark’s and elsewhere
it became so familiar a form that it was copied and continued by the
Renaissance architects even to the end of the 16th century.One of the best illustrations of these peculiarities is the church of
Moné tés Choras at Constantinople, now converted into a mosque and
called Kahriyeh Djamisi.The older part of it seems to belong to the
11th century, the side-aisles to the 12th, and though small, it
illustrates the style perfectly.The porch consists of five arches
covered with an intersecting vault, visible both externally and
internally.The last two bays are covered with cupolas which still
retain their mosaics internally, and those of singular beauty and
brilliancy, though, owing to the constructive defects of the
intermediate parts, the wet has leaked through, and the mosaics have
mostly peeled off.Externally the front is ornamented with courses of
stones alternating with two or three layers of tiles, and even in its
ruined state is effective and picturesque.Its principal interest is
that it shows what was the matrix[235] of the contemporary church of St.Subsequent additions have much modified the external
appearance of St.Mark, but there can be very little doubt that
originally it was intended to be very like the façade shown in Woodcut
No.Not far from Moné tés Choras there are two other churches of the same
class and of about the same age.One, the Pantokrator, has been added to
at various times so as to cover a large space of ground, but it consists
consequently of small and ill-assorted parts.It retains, however, a
good deal of its marble pavements and other features of interest.The
other, known as the Fethîyeh Djamisi, is smaller and more complete, and
possesses some mosaics of considerable beauty.Elevation of Church of the Theotokos.(From Lenoir,
‘Architecture Monastique.’) Enlarged scale.]The best example of its class, however, in Constantinople is that known
as the Theotokos.Like those just mentioned it is very small, the church
itself being only 37 ft.by 45, and, though its double narthex and
lateral adjuncts add considerably to its dimensions, it is still only a
very small church.Some parts of it are as old as the 9th or 10th
century, but the façade represented in Woodcut No.333 is certainly not
older than the 12th century.Taking it altogether, it is perhaps the
most complete and elegant church of its class now known to exist in or
near the capital, and many of its details are of great beauty and
perfection.It seems scarcely possible to suppose that the meagre half-dozen of
small churches just enumerated are all that were erected in the capital
between the death of Justinian and the fall of the city.Yet there is no
evidence that the Turks destroyed any.They converted
them into mosques, finding them especially convenient for that purpose,
and they have maintained them with singularly little alteration to the
present day.This deficiency of examples in the capital is to some extent supplied by
those which are found existing at Thessalonica.Three churches belonging
to this age are illustrated in Texier and Pullan’s work.Apse of Church of the Apostles, Thessalonica.(From
Texier and Pullan.)]The first of these is the church of Kazandjita Djami, dedicated to the
Mother of God, a small church measuring only 53 ft.by 37, exclusive of
the apse.Its date is perfectly ascertained—viz., 1028.Next to these comes the church of Elias, A.D.1054, and very similar to
it in style is that of the Apostles (Woodcut No.334), which we may
consequently date with safety in the 11th century, from this
juxtaposition alone, though there are several other examples which
enable us to treat it as a characteristic type of the age.It is a
pleasing and picturesque specimen of Byzantine brickwork.Like all the
churches of the time, it is small, 63 ft.In plan it
very much resembles the Theotokos at Constantinople, but in elevation is
taller and thinner; though whether this arises from any local
peculiarity, or from some difference of age, is not clear.The earthquakes of the capital may have induced a less ambitious
form, as far as height is concerned, than was adopted in the provinces.There can be little doubt but that, if a systematic search were made
among the churches of Greece, many would be brought to light which would
be most useful in completing our knowledge of the Neo-Byzantine
style.[236] At Mount Athos there exists from twenty to thirty
monasteries, each with its Catholicon or principal church and other
chapels.Many of these are of ancient date, ranging between the 10th and
16th centuries, and although some of them may have been restored, in
some cases rebuilt in later times, they have not yet been examined or
illustrated by any competent architect.Brockhaus in his work[237] gives
the plan of three churches, one of which, the Catholicon (dated 1043) of
the Dochiariu Monastery (Woodcut No.335), is further illustrated by a
bird’s-eye view taken from a photograph.The domes and drums over the
narthex and two eastern chapels would seem to be later additions, made
either in consequence of the proximity of the buildings of the monastery
which obscured the light obtainable from windows, or to show better the
wall frescoes, which in the case of the narthex, where no windows ever
existed, must have been quite dark at first.The oldest church (963
A.D.)apparently is that of the Protaton at Caryas, which consists of a
short nave, a transept, and a long choir, and is wanting in that one
feature which is supposed to be characteristic of a Byzantine church,
viz., a dome; the whole building is covered like a basilica with a flat
wooden roof, beneath which are clerestory windows.Photogravures or
woodcuts are given of the churches of Chilandari (1197 A.D.), Xeropotamu
(1028-34 A.D.), the Laura (963 A.D., but rebuilt under Turkish rule),
and woodcuts from photographs in an interesting description of the
Monasteries by Mr.A. Riley,[238] give a good general idea of the work
to be found in Athos, from which it would seem that the chief interest
centres in the sumptuous carvings of the icon and stalls,[239] and in
the frescoes with which most of the interiors of the churches are
painted.For Greece proper we are dependent almost wholly on Couchaud[240] and
Blouet.[241] So far as the illustrations go they suggest that there are
no churches of such dimensions as would ensure dignity, nor are any so
beautiful in outline or detail as to make us regret much that we do not
know more about them.Still they are sufficiently original to be worthy
of study, and when properly known may help to join together some of the
scattered links of the chain which once connected the architecture of
the West and East, but which is at present so difficult to follow out.In Athens there are several churches of considerable interest, and not
without architectural pretension.The
largest is that known as Panagia Lycodemo, or the church of St.Nicodemus, and is only 62 ft.It seems
also to be the oldest, since its dome is partially pierced with windows
inside, though outside there is a distinctly marked drum (Woodcut No.Notwithstanding the smallness of its dimensions, considerable
effect is obtained internally by the judicious arrangement of the parts
and the harmony of proportion which reigns throughout.The exterior is
also pleasing, though the loss of the cornice gives an unfinished look
to the whole, and there is a want of sufficient connection between the
dome and the walls of the building to make them part of one composition.A more beautiful and more interesting example is the church known as the
Catholicon or Cathedral at Athens (Woodcut No.It is a cathedral,
however, only in a Greek sense, certainly not as understood in the Latin
Church, for its dimensions are only 40 ft.It
is almost impossible to judge of its age from its details, since they
are partly borrowed from older classical buildings, or imitations of
classical forms, so fashioned as to harmonize with parts which are old.But the tallness of its dome, the form of its windows, and the internal
arrangements, all point to a very modern date for its erection—as
probably the 13th century as the 11th or 12th.The church of the Virgin at Mistra in the Peloponnesus was built in the
13th century on a hillside overlooking the plain of Sparta, and partly
with materials taken from the remains of the ancient city; but though it
belongs possibly to the same age as the Catholicon at Athens, it differs
considerably from it in style, and bears much more resemblance to the
churches of Apulia and Sicily than either of those described above.(From Couchaud, ‘Églises
Byzantines en Grèce.’) Enlarged scale.]Where arcades are used externally in these Greek churches, they are
generally supported by pillars of somewhat classical look (often old
classic columns and capitals were used up), crowned by capitals of the
square foliaged form, employed to support arches in the early styles all
over Europe; and the windows, when divided, take merely the form of
diminutive arcades.The Byzantines never attained to tracery; all their
early windows are single round-headed openings.These were afterwards
grouped together in threes and fives; and, as in the Gothic style, when
they could be put under one discharging arch, the piers were attenuated
till they became almost mullions, but always supporting constructive
arches, without any tendency to run into interlacing forms like the
Gothic.The universal employment of mural painting in Byzantine
churches, and the consequent exclusion of painted glass, rendered the
use of the large windows which the Gothic architects employed quite
inadmissible; and in such a climate very much smaller openings sufficed
to admit all the light that was required.Tracery would thus, in fact,
have been an absurdity, and the windows were often filled in with
transparent marble slabs pierced with holes, which were either glazed or
occasionally even left open.The Byzantine architects sought to ornament
their windows externally by the employment of tiles or colours disposed
in various patterns, and often produced a very pleasing effect, as may
be seen from the woodcut (No.337) illustrating the apse of the Panagia
Lycodemo at Athens, in the Hebdomon Palace (Woodcut No.342), and other
specimens already quoted.Occasionally we find in these churches projecting porches or balconies,
and machicolations, which give great relief to the general flatness of
the walls.These features are all marked with that elegance peculiar to
the East, and more especially to a people claiming descent from the
ancient Greeks, and possibly having some of their blood in their veins.Sometimes, too, even a subordinate apse is supported on a bracket-like
balcony, so as to form a very pleasing object, as in the accompanying
specimen from Mistra.On the whole the Neo-Byzantine style may be said to be characterised by
considerable elegance, with occasional combinations of a superior order;
but after the time of Justinian the country was too deficient in unity
or science to attempt anything great or good, and too poor to aspire to
grandeur, so that it has no claim to rank among the great styles of the
earth.[242] The old Byzantine style was elevated to a first-class
position through the buildings of Justinian; but from his time the
history of the art is a history of decline, like that of the Eastern
Empire itself and of Greece, down to the final extinction both of the
Empire and the style, under the successive conquests by the Venetians
and the Turks.The only special claim which the Neo-Byzantine style
makes upon our sympathies or attention is that of being the direct
descendant of Greek and Roman art.As such, it forms a connecting link
between the past and present which must not be overlooked, while in
itself it has sufficient merit to reward the student who shall apply
himself to its elucidation.Palace of the Hebdomon, Constantinople.]It is more than probable that very considerable remains of the civil or
domestic architecture of the Neo-Byzantine period may still be
recovered.Most of their palaces or public buildings have continued to
be occupied by their successors, but the habits of Turkish life are
singularly opposed to the prying of the archæologist.Almost the only
building which has been brought to light and illustrated is the palace
of the Hebdomon at Blachernæ in Constantinople, built by Constantine
Porphyrogenitus (913-949).All that remains of it, however, is a block
of buildings 80 ft.by 40 in plan, forming one end of a courtyard; those
at the other end, which were more extensive, being too much ruined to be
restored.The parts that remain probably belong to the 9th century, and
consist of two halls, one over the other, the lower supported by pillars
carrying vaults, the upper free.The façade towards the court (Woodcut
342) is of considerable elegance, being adorned by a mosaic of bricks of
various colours disposed in graceful patterns, and forming an
architectural decoration which, if not of the highest class, is very
appropriate for domestic architecture.One great cause of the deficiency of examples may be the combustibility
of the capital.They may have been destroyed in the various fires, and
outside Constantinople the number of large cities and their wealth and
importance was gradually decreasing till the capital itself sunk into
the power of the Turks in the year 1453.CHAPTER V.

The architectural province of Armenia forms an almost exact pendant to
that of Greece in the history of Byzantine architecture.Both were early
converted to Christianity, and Greece remained Christian without any
interruption from that time to this.Yet all her earlier churches have
perished, we hardly know why, and left us nothing but an essentially
Mediæval style.Nearly the same thing happened in Armenia, but there the
loss is only too easily accounted for.The Persian persecution in the
5th and 6th centuries must have been severe and lasting, and the great
_bouleversement_ of the Mahomedan irruption in the 7th century would
easily account for the disappearance of all the earlier monuments.When,
in more tranquil times—in the 8th and 9th centuries—the Christians were
permitted to rebuild their churches, we find them all of the same small
type as those of Greece, with tall domes, painted with frescoes
internally, and depending for external effect far more on minute
elaboration of details than on any grandeur of design or proportion.Although the troubles and persecutions from the 5th to the 8th century
may have caused the destruction of the greater part of the monuments, it
by no means follows that all have perished.On the contrary, we know of
the church above alluded to (p.428) as still existing at Nisibin and
belonging to the 4th century, and there can be little doubt that many
others exist in various corners of the land; but they have hardly yet
been looked for, at least not by anyone competent to discriminate
between what was really old and what may have belonged to some
subsequent rebuilding or repair.Till this more careful examination of the province shall have been
accomplished, our history of the style cannot be carried back beyond the
Hejira.Even then very great difficulty exists in arranging the
materials, and in assigning correct dates to the various examples.In
the works of Texier,[243] Dubois,[244] Brosset,[245] and Grimm[246] some
forty or fifty churches are described and figured in more or less
detail, but in most cases the dates assigned to them are derived from
written testimony only, the authors not having sufficient knowledge of
the style to be able to check the very fallacious evidence of the
_litera scripta_.In consequence of this, the dates usually given are
those of the building of the first church on the spot, whereas, in a
country so troubled by persecution as Armenia, the original church may
have been rebuilt several times, and what we now see is often very
modern indeed.Among the churches now existing in Armenia, the oldest seems to be that
in the village of Dighour near Ani.There are neither traditions nor
inscriptions to assist in fixing its date; but, from the simplicity of
its form and its quasi-classical details, it is evidently older than any
other known examples, and with the aid of the information conveyed in De
Vogüé’s recent publications we can have little hesitation in assigning
it to the 7th century.[247] The church is not large, being only 95 ft.Internally its design is characterised by
extreme solidity and simplicity, and all the details are singularly
classical in outline.The dome is an ellipse, timidly constructed, with
far more than the requisite amount of abutment.One of its most marked
peculiarities is the existence of two external niches placed in
projecting wings and which were no doubt intended to receive altars.Its
flanks are ornamented by three-quarter columns of debased classical
design.These support an architrave which is bent over the heads of the
windows as in the churches of Northern Syria erected during the 6th
century.Its western and lateral doorways are ornamented by horse-shoe arches,
which are worth remarking here, as it is a feature which the Saracenic
architects used so currently and employed for almost every class of
opening.The oldest example of this form known is in the doorway of the
building called Takt-i-Gero on Mount Zagros.[248] In this little shrine,
all the other details are so purely and essentially classic that the
building must be dated before or about the time of Constantine.The
horse-shoe arch again occurs in the church at Dana on the Euphrates in
540.[249] At Dighour we find it used, not in construction but as an
ornamental feature.The stilting of the arch was evidently one of those
experiments which the architects of that time were making in order to
free themselves from the trammels of the Roman semi-circular arch.The
Saracens carried it much further and used it with marked success, but
this is probably the last occasion in which it was employed by a
Christian architect as a decorative expedient.The six buttresses, with their offsets, which adorn the façade, are
another curious feature in the archæology of this church.If they are
integral parts of the original design, which there seems no reason to
doubt, they anticipate by several centuries the appearance of this form
in Western Europe.West Elevation of Church at Usunlar.One of the oldest and least altered of the Armenian churches seems to be
that of Usunlar, said to have been erected by the Catholicos Jean IV.In plan it looks like a peristylar
temple, but the verandahs which surround it are only low arcades, and
have very little affinity with classical forms.These are carried round
the front, but there pierced only by the doorway.The elevation, as here
exhibited, is simple, but sufficiently expresses the internal
arrangements, and, with an octagonal dome, forms, when seen in
perspective, a pleasing object from every point of view.Both plan and
design are, however, exceptional in the province.A far more usual
arrangement is that found at Pitzounda in Abkassia, which may be
considered as the typical form of an Armenian church.It is said to have
been erected by the Emperor Justinian, and there is nothing in the style
or ornamentation of the lower part that seems to gainsay its being his.But the plan is so like many that belong to a much later age, that we
must hesitate before we can feel sure that it has not been rebuilt at
some more modern date.Its cupola certainly belongs to a period long
after the erection of Sta.327),
when the dome pierced with tall windows had become the fashionable form
of dome in the Byzantine school.Its interior, also, is unusually tall,
and the pointed arches under the dome look like integral parts of the
design, and when so employed belong certainly to a much more modern
date.On the whole, therefore, it seems that this church, as we now see
it, may have been rebuilt in the 9th or 10th century.Whatever its date, it is a pleasing example of the style.Externally it
is devoid of ornament except what is obtained by the insertion of tiles
between the courses of the stone, and a similar relief to the windows;
but even this little introduction of colour gives it a gay and cheerful
appearance, more than could easily be obtained by mouldings or carving
in stone.The upper galleries of the nave and the chapels of the choir are also
well expressed in the external design, and altogether, for a small
church—which it is (only 137 ft.by 75)—it is as pleasing a composition
as could easily be found.The idea that the date of this church is considerably more modern than
Dubois and others are inclined to assign to it, is confirmed by a
comparison of its plan with that at Bedochwinta, which Brosset
determines from inscriptions to belong to the date 1556-1575; and the
knowledge lately acquired tends strongly to the conviction that this
plan of church belongs to a later period in the Middle Ages, though it
is difficult to determine when it was introduced, and it may be only a
continuation of a much earlier form.One other church of this part of the world seems to claim especial
mention, that of Mokwi, built in the 10th century, and painted as we
learn from inscriptions, between 1080 and 1125.It is a large and
handsome church, but its principal interest lies in the fact that in
dimensions and arrangement it is almost identical with the
contemporaneous church of Sta.Sophia at Novogorod, showing a connection
between the two countries which will be more particularly pointed out
hereafter.It is now very much ruined, and covered with a veil of
creepers which prevents its outward form from being easily
distinguished.[250]]

As will be perceived, its plan is only an extension of the two last
mentioned, having five aisles instead of three; but it is smaller in
scale and more timid in execution.The church which it most resembles is
that at Trabala in Syria (Woodcut No.330), which is certainly of an
earlier date than any we are acquainted with further east.Practically
the same plan occurs at Athens (Woodcut No.338), and at Mistra (Woodcut
No.339), but these seem on a smaller scale than at Mokwi, so that it
may be considered as the typical form of a Neo-Byzantine church for four
or five centuries, and it would consequently be unsafe to attempt to fix
a date from its peculiarities.Plan of Church at Etchmiasdin.Interesting as these may be in an historical point of view, the most
important ecclesiastical establishment in this part of the world is that
of Etchmiasdin.Here are four churches built on the spots from which,
according to tradition, rose the two arches or rainbows, crossing one
another at right angles, on which our Saviour is said to have sat when
he appeared to St.They consequently ought to be at the four
angles of a square, or rectangle of some sort, but this is far from
being the case.The principal of these churches is that whose plan is
represented in Woodcut No.It stands in the centre of a large
square, surrounded by ecclesiastical buildings, and is on the whole
rather an imposing edifice.Its porch is modern; so also, comparatively
speaking, is its dome; but the plan, if not the greater part of the
substructure, is ancient, and exhibits the plainness and simplicity
characteristic of its age.The other three churches lay claim to as
remote a date of foundation as this, but all have been so altered in
modern times that they have now no title to antiquity.The idea that the churches at Pitzounda and Bedochwinta must be
comparatively modern is confirmed by comparing their plan with that of
Kouthais, a church which there seems no reasonable ground for doubting
was founded in 1007, and erected, pretty much as we now find it, in the
early part of the 11th century.It has neither coupled piers nor pointed
arches, but is adorned externally with reed-like pilasters and elaborate
frets, such as were certainly employed at Ani in the course of the 11th
century.355) of one of its windows
exhibits the Armenian style of decoration of this age, but is such as
certainly was not employed before this time, though with various
modifications it became typical of the style at its period of greatest
development.Even Etchmiasdin, however, sinks into insignificance, in an
architectural point of view, when compared with Ani, which was the
capital of Armenia during its period of greatest unity and elevation,
and was adorned by the Bagratide dynasty with a series of buildings
which still strike the traveller with admiration, at least for the
beauty of their details; for, like all churches in this part of the
world, they are very small.If, however, the cathedral at Ani is
interesting to the architect from its style, it is still more so to the
archæologist from its date, since there seems no reason to doubt that it
was built in the year 1010, as recorded in an inscription on its walls.This, perhaps, might be put on one side as a mistake, if it were not
that there are two beautiful inscriptions on the façade, one of which is
dated 1049, the other 1059.To this we must add our knowledge that the
city was sacked by Alp Arslan in 1064, and that the dynasty which alone
could erect such a monument was extinguished in 1080.With all this
evidence, it is startling to find a church not only with pointed arches
but with coupled piers and all the characteristics of a complete
pointed-arch style, such as might be found in Italy or Sicily not
earlier than the 13th century.This peculiarity is, however, confined to
the constructive parts of the interior.The plan is that of Pitzounda or
Bedochwinta, modified only by the superior constructive arrangement
which the pointed arch enabled the architects to introduce; and
externally the only pointed arch anywhere to be detected, is in the
transept, where the arch of the vault is simulated to pass through to
the exterior.In the plan and elevation of the building will be observed a peculiarity
which was afterwards almost universal in the style.It is the angular
recess which marks the form of the apses outside without breaking the
main lines of the building.In the lateral elevation of this cathedral
(Woodcut No.358) they are introduced on each side of the portal where
the construction did not require them, in order to match those at the
east end.But in the Cathedral at Samthawis (Woodcut No.359) they are
seen in their proper places on each side of the central apse.Though
this church was erected between the years 1050-1079, we find these
niches adorned with a foliation (Woodcut No.360) very like what we are
accustomed to consider the invention of the 14th century in Europe,
though even more elegant than anything of its class used by the Gothic
architects.At Sandjerli, not far from Ani, is another church, which from
inscriptions translated by M. Brosset, and from sections given by him,
appears to belong to the same date (1033-1044), and to possess coupled
columns and pointed arches like those of the cathedral of Ani, which
indeed it resembles in many points, and which renders the date above
given highly probable.East Elevation of Chapel at Samthawis.The plans above quoted may probably be taken as those most typical of
the style, but in no part of the world are the arrangements of churches
so various.All being small, there were no constructive difficulties to
be encountered, and as no congregation was to be accommodated, the
architects apparently considered themselves at liberty to follow their
fancies in any manner that occurred to them.The consequence is that the
plans of Armenian churches defy classification; some are square, or
rectangles of every conceivable proportion of length to breadth, some
octagons or hexagons, and some of the most indescribable irregularity.Frequently two, three, or four are grouped and joined together.In some
instances the sacred number of seven are coupled together in one design,
though more generally each little church is an independent erection; but
they are all so small that their plans are of comparatively little
importance.No grandeur of effect or poetry of perspective can be
obtained without considerable dimensions, and these are not to be found
in Armenia.(From Layard’s ‘Nineveh and
Babylon.’)]

There are also some examples of circular churches, but these are far
from being numerous.Generally speaking they are tombs, or connected
with sepulchral rites, and are indeed mere amplifications of the usual
tombs of the natives of the country, which are generally little models
of the domes of Armenian churches placed on the ground, though perhaps
it would be more correct to say that the domes were copied from the
tombs than the reverse.The most elegant of all those hitherto made known is one found at Ani,
illustrated in Woodcuts Nos.Notwithstanding the smallness of
its dimensions, it is one of the most elegant sepulchral chapels known.Another on a larger scale (Woodcut No.This tomb shows all the peculiarities of the Armenian
style of the 11th or 12th century.Though so much larger, it is by no
means so beautiful as the last mentioned tomb at Ani.In its
ornamentation a further refinement is introduced, inasmuch as the
reed-like columns are tied together by true love-knots instead of
capitals—a freak not uncommon either in Europe at the same age, or in
the East at the present day, but by no means to be recommended as an
architectural expedient.With scarcely an exception, all the buildings in the Armenian provinces
are so small that they would hardly deserve a place in a history of
architecture were it not for the ingenuity of their plans and the
elegance of their details.The beauty of the latter is so remarkable
that, in order to convey a correct notion of the style, it would be
necessary to illustrate them to an extent incompatible with the scope of
this work.In them too will be found much that has hitherto been
ascribed to other sources.364), for
instance, would generally be put down as Saracenic of the best age, but
it belongs, with a great deal more quite as elegant, to one of the
churches at Ani; and the capital from Gelathi (Woodcut No.365) would
not excite attention if found in Ireland.The interlacing scrolls which
occupy its head are one of the most usual as well as one of the most
elegant modes of decoration employed in the province, and are applied
with a variety and complexity nowhere else found in stone, though they
may be equalled in some works illustrated by the pen.Besides, however, its beauty in an artistic point of view, this basket
pattern, as it is sometimes called, is still more so as an Ethnographic
indication which, when properly investigated, may lead to the most
important conclusions.366, 367, and
368, taken from churches at a now deserted village called Ish Khan, will
serve to explain its more usual forms; but it occurs almost everywhere
in the Armenian architectural province, and with as infinite a variety
of details as are to be found with its employment in Irish manuscripts.Window in small Church at Ish Khan, Tortoom.Jamb of doorway at Ish Khan Church, Armenia.Out of Armenia it occurs in the church at Kurtea el Argyisch in
Wallachia (Woodcut No.385), and is found in Hungary and Styria, and no
antiquary will probably fail to recognise it as the most usual and
beautiful pattern on Irish crosses and Scotch sculptured stones.On the
other hand it occurs frequently in the monolithic deepdans or lamp-posts
and in the temples on the Canarese or West Coast of India, and in all
these instances with so little change of form that it is almost
impossible that these examples should be independent inventions.Still
the gaps in the sequence are so great that it is very difficult to see
how they could emanate from one centre.Few, however, who know anything
of the early architecture of Ireland can fancy that it did come from
Rome across Great Britain, but that it must have had its origin further
east, among some people using groups of churches and small cells,
instead of congregational basilicas.So far, too, as we can yet see, it
is to the East we must look for the original design of the mysterious
round towers which form so characteristic a feature of Irish
architecture, and were afterwards so conspicuous as minars in the East,
and nowhere more so than in Armenia.Recent researches, too, are making
it more and more clear that Nestorian churches did exist all down the
West Coast of India from a very early period, so that it would not be
impossible that from Persia and Armenia they introduced the favourite
style of ornament.All this may seem idle speculation, and it may turn out that the
similarities are accidental, but at present it certainly does not look
as if they were, and if they do emanate from a common centre, tracing
them back to their original may lead to such curious ethnological and
historical conclusions that it is at all events worth while pointing
them out in order that others may pursue the investigation to its
legitimate conclusion.Taken altogether, Armenian architecture is far more remarkable for
elegance than for grandeur, and possesses none of that greatness of
conception or beauty of outline essential to an important architectural
style.It is still worthy of more attention than it has hitherto
received, even for its own sake.Its great title to interest will always
be its ethnological value, being the direct descendant of the Sassanian
style, and the immediate parent of that of Russia.At the same time,
standing on the eastern confines of the Byzantine Empire, it received
thence that impress of Christian art which distinguished it from the
former, and which it transmitted to the latter.It thus forms one of
those important links in the chain of architectural history which when
lost render the study of the subject so dark and perplexed, but when
appreciated add so immensely to its philosophical interest.ROCK-CUT CHURCHES.Churches at Tchekerman, Inkerman, and Sebastopol—Excavations at Kieghart
  and Vardzie.Intermediate between the Armenian province which has just been described
and the Russian, which comes next in the series, lies a territory of
more than usual interest to the archæologist, though hardly demanding
more than a passing notice in a work devoted to architecture.In the
neighbourhood of Kertch, which was originally colonised by a people of
Grecian or Pelasgic origin, are found numerous tumuli and sepulchres
belonging generally to the best age of Greek art, but which, barring
some slight local peculiarities, would hardly seem out of place in the
cemeteries of Etruria or Crete.At a later age it was from the shores of the Palus Mœotis and the
Caucasus that tradition makes Woden migrate to Scandinavia, bearing with
him that form of Buddhism[251] which down to the 11th century remained
the religion of the North—while, as if to mark the presence of some
strange people in the land, we find everywhere rock-cut excavations of a
character, to say the least of it, very unusual in the West.These have not yet been examined with the care necessary to enable us to
speak very positively regarding them;[252] but, from what we do know, it
seems that they were not in any instance tombs, like those in Italy and
many of those in Africa or Syria.Nor can we positively assert that any
of them were viharas or monasteries[253] like most of those in India.Generally they seem to have been ordinary dwellings, but in some
instances appropriated by the Christians and formed into churches.(From Dubois de Montpereux.)]One, apparently, of the oldest is a rectangular excavation at Tchekerman
in the Crimea.in length by 21 in width, with hardly any
decoration on its walls, but having in the centre a choir with four
pillars on each face, which there seems no doubt was originally devoted
to Christian purposes.The cross on the low screen that separates it
from the nave is too deeply cut and too evidently integral to have been
added.But for this it would seem to have been intended for a Buddhist
vihara.(From Dubois de
Montpereux.)]Under the fortress at Inkerman—facing the position held by our
army—there is an excavation undoubtedly of Christian origin.It is a
small church with side-aisles, apse, and all the necessary
accompaniments.Beyond this is a square excavation apparently intended
as a refectory, and other apartments devoted to the use of a monastic
establishment.These again are so like what we find among the Buddhist
excavations in India as to be quite startling.The one point in which
this church differs from a Buddhist chaitya is that the aisle does not
run round behind the altar.This is universally the case in Buddhist,
but only exceptionally so in Christian, churches.Close to Sebastopol is another small church cave with its accompanying
monastery.This one is said to be comparatively modern, and if its
paintings are parts of the original design it may be so, but no certain
data are given for fixing the age of the last two examples.That under
the fortress (Woodcut No.371) seems, however, to be of considerable
antiquity.There is one which in plan is very like those just described at Vardzie,
said to belong to the 12th century, and another, almost absolutely
identical with a Buddhist vihara, at Kieghart in Armenia, which has a
date upon it, A.D.On the banks of the Kour, however, at Ouplous-Tsikhe and Vardzie, are
some excavations which are either temples or monasteries, and which
range from the Christian era downwards.These are generally assumed to
be residences—one is called the palace of Queen Thamar—and they were
evidently intended for some stately purpose.Yet they were not temples
in any sense in which that term would be employed by the Greek or Roman
world.Whatever their destination, these rock-cut examples make, when
taken altogether, as curious a group of monuments as are to be found in
this corner of Asia, and which may lead afterwards to curious
archæological inferences.At present we are hardly in a position to
speculate on the subject, and merely point to it here as one well
meriting further investigation.MEDIÆVAL ARCHITECTURE OF RUSSIA.Churches at Kief—Novogorod—Moscow—Towers.Rurik the Varangian at Novogorod   A.D.850

The long series of the architectural styles of the Christian world which
has been described in the preceding pages terminates most appropriately
with the description of the art of a people who had less knowledge of
architecture and less appreciation of its beauties than any other with
which we are acquainted.During the Middle Ages the Russians did not
erect one single building which is worthy of admiration, either from its
dimensions, its design, or the elegance of its details; nor did they
invent one single architectural feature which can be called their own.It is true the Tartars brought with them their bulbous form of dome, and
the Russians adopted it, and adhere to it to the present day,
unconscious that it is the symbol of their subjection to a race they
affect to despise; but excepting as regards this one feature, their
architecture is only a bad and debased copy of the style of the
Byzantine Empire.There is nothing, in fact, in the architecture of the
country to lead us to doubt that the mass of the population of Russia
was always of purely Aryan stock, speaking a language more nearly allied
to the Sanskrit than any of the other Mediæval tongues of Europe, and
that whatever amount of Tartar blood may have been imported, it was not
sufficient to cure the inartistic tendencies of the race.So much is
this felt to be the case, that the Russians themselves hardly lay claim
to the design of a single building in their country from the earliest
times to the present day.They admit that all the churches at Kief,
their earliest capital, were erected by Greek architects; those of
Moscow by Italians or Germans; while those of St.Petersburg, we know,
were, with hardly a single exception, erected by Italian, German, or
French architects.These last have perpetrated caricatures of revived
Roman architecture worse than are to be found anywhere else.Bad as are
some of the imitations of Roman art found in western Europe, they are
all the work of native artists; are, partially at least, adapted to the
climate, and common-sense peeps through their worst absurdities; but in
Russia only second-class foreigners have been employed, and the result
is a style that out-herods Herod in absurdity and bad taste.Architecture has languished not only in Russia, but wherever the
Sclavonic race predominates.In Poland, Hungary, Moldavia, Wallachia,
&c., although some of these countries have at times been rich and
prosperous, there is not a single original structure worthy to be placed
in comparison with even the second-class contemporary buildings of the
Celtic or Teutonic races.Besides the ethnographic inaptitude of the nation, however, there are
other causes which would lead us to anticipate, _à priori_, that nothing
either great or beautiful was likely to exist in the Mediæval
architecture of Russia.In the first place, from the conversion of Olga
(964) to the accession of Peter the Great (1689), with whom the national
style expired, the country hardly emerged from barbarism.Torn by
internal troubles, or devastated by incursions of the Tartars, the
Russians never enjoyed the repose necessary for the development of art,
and the country was too thinly peopled to admit of that concentration of
men necessary for the carrying out of any great architectural
undertaking.Another cause of bad architecture is found in the material used, which
is almost universally brick covered with plaster; and it is well known
that the tendency of plaster architecture is constantly to extravagance
in detail and bad taste in every form.It is also extremely
perishable,—a fact which opens the way to repairs and alterations in
defiance of congruity and taste, and to the utter annihilation of
everything like archæological value in the building.When the material was not brick it was wood, like most of the houses in
Russia of the present day; and the destroying hand of time, aided no
doubt by fire and the Tartar invasions, have swept away many buildings
which would serve to fill up gaps, now, it is feared, irremediable in
the history of the art.Notwithstanding all this, the history of architecture in Russia need not
be considered as entirely a blank, or as wholly devoid of interest.Locally we can follow the history of the style from the south to the
north.Springing originally from two roots—one at Constantinople, the
other in Armenia—it gradually extended itself northward.It first
established itself at Cherson, then at Kief, and after these at Vladimir
and Moscow, whence it spread to the great commercial city of Novogorod.At all these places it maintained itself till supplanted by the rise of
St.Though the Princess Olga was baptised in 955, the general profession of
Christianity in Russia did not take place till the reign of Vladimir
(981-1015).He built the wooden cathedral at Cherson, which has
perished.At Kief the same monarch built the church of Dessiatinnaya,
the remains of which existed till within the last few years, when they
were removed to give place to a modern reproduction.Basil in the same city, which, notwithstanding modern
improvements, still retains its ancient plan, and is nearly identical in
arrangement and form with the Catholicon at Athens (Woodcut No.372) gives a fair idea of the usual dimensions of
the older churches of Russia.The parts shaded lighter are subsequent
additions.A greater builder than Vladimir was Prince Yaroslaf (1019-1054).Irene at Kief (Woodcut No.373), the ruins of
which still exist.It is a good specimen of the smaller class of
churches of that date.His great works were the cathedrals of Kief and Novogorod, both
dedicated to Sta.Sophia, and with the church at Mokwi quoted above
(Woodcut No.352) forming the most interesting group of Russian churches
of that age.All three belong to the 11th century, and are so extremely
similar in plan, that, deducting the subsequent additions from the two
Russian examples, they may almost be said to be identical.They also
show so intimate a connection between the places on the great commercial
road from the Caucasus to the Baltic, that they point out at once the
line along which we must look for the origin of the style.Of the three, that at Kief[254] (Woodcut No.374) is the largest; but it
is nearly certain that the two outer aisles are subsequent additions,
and that the original church was confined to the remaining seven aisles.As it now stands its dimensions are 185 ft.from north to south, and 136
from east to west.It consequently covers only about 25,000 ft., or not
half the usual dimensions of a Western cathedral of the same class.As
will be perceived, its plan is like that of the churches of Asia Minor,
so far as the central aisles are concerned.In lateral extension it
resembles a mosque, a form elsewhere very unusual in Christian churches,
but which here may be a Tartar peculiarity.At all events it is
generally found in Russian churches, which never adopt the long
basilican form of the West.If their length in an eastern and western
direction ever exceeds the breadth, it is only by taking in the narthex
with the body of the church.East End of the Church at Novogorod.Internally this church retains many of its original arrangements, and
many decorations which, if not original, are at least restorations or
copies of those which previously occupied their places.Externally it
has been so repaired and rebuilt that it is difficult to detect what
belongs to the original work.In this respect the church of Novogorod has been more fortunate.Owing
to the early decline of the town it has not been much modernised.The
interior retains many of its primitive features.Among other furniture
is a pair of bronze doors of Italian workmanship of the 12th century
closely resembling those of San Zenone at Verona.The part of the
exterior that retains most of its early features is the eastern end,
represented in the Woodcut No.It retains the long reed-like shafts
which the Armenians borrowed from the Sassanians, and which penetrated
even to this remote corner.Whether the two lower circular apses shown
in the view are old is by no means clear: but it is probable that they
are at least built on ancient foundations.The domes on the roof, and
indeed all the upper part of the building, belong to a more modern date
than the substructure.The cathedral of Tchernigow, near Kief, founded 1024, retains perhaps
more of its original appearance externally than any other church of its
age.Like almost all Russian churches it is square in plan, with a dome
in the centre surrounded by four smaller cupolas placed diagonally at
the corners.To the eastward are three apses, and the narthex is flanked
by two round towers, the upper parts of which, with the roofs, have been
modernised, but the whole of the walls remain as originally erected,
especially the end of the transept, which precisely resembles what we
find in Greek Churches of the period.(From Blasius, ‘Reise in
Russland.’)]

To the same age belong the convent of the Volkof (1100) and of Yourief
at Novogorod, the church of the Ascension, and several others at Kief.All these are so modernised as, except in their plans, to show but
slight traces of their origin.Another of the great buildings of the age was the cathedral of Vladimir
(1046).It is said to have been built, like the rest, by Greek artists.The richness and beauty of this building have been celebrated by early
travellers, but it has been entirely passed over by more modern writers.From this it is perhaps to be inferred that its ancient form is
completely disguised in modern alterations.The ascendency of Kief was of short duration.Early in the 13th century
the city suffered greatly from civil wars, fires, and devastations of
every description, which humbled her pride, and inflicted ruin upon her
from which she never wholly recovered.Vladimir was after this the residence of the grand dukes, and in the
beginning of the 14th century Moscow became the capital, which it
continued to be till the seat of empire was transferred by Peter the
Great to St.During these three centuries Moscow was no
doubt adorned with many important buildings, since almost every church
traces its foundation back to the 14th century; but as fires and Tartar
invasions have frequently swept over the city since then, few retain any
of the features of their original foundation, and it may therefore
perhaps be well to see what can be gleaned in the provinces before
describing the buildings of the capital.As far as can be gathered from the sketch-books of travellers or their
somewhat meagre notes, there are few towns of Russia of any importance
during the Middle Ages which do not possess churches said to have been
founded in the first centuries after its conversion to Christianity;
though whether the existing buildings are the originals, or how far they
may have been altered and modernised, will not be known till some
archæologist visits the country, directing his attention to this
particular inquiry.Although the Russians probably built as great a
number of churches as any nation of Christendom, yet like the Greek
churches they were all undoubtedly small.Kief is said, even in the age
of Yaroslaf, to have contained 400 churches; Vladimir nearly as many.Moscow, in the year 1600, had 400 (thirty-seven of which were in the
Kremlin), and now possesses many more.Many of the village churches still retain their ancient features; the
example here given of one near Novogorod belongs probably to the 12th
century, and is not later than the 13th.It retains its shafted apse,
its bulb-shaped Tartar dome, and, as is always the case in Russia, a
square detached belfry—though in this instance apparently more modern
than the edifice itself.378 is the type of a great number
of the old village churches, which, like the houses of the peasants, are
of wood, generally of logs laid one on the other, with their round ends
intersecting at the angles, like the log-huts of America at the present
day.As architectural objects they are of course insignificant, but
still they are characteristic and picturesque.Village Church near Tzarskoe Selo.Internally all the arrangements of the stone churches are such as are
appropriate for pictorial rather than for sculptural decoration.The
pillars are generally large cylinders covered with portraits of saints,
and the capitals are plain, cushion-like rolls with painted ornaments.The vaults are not relieved by ribs, or by any projections that could
interfere with the  decorations.In the wooden churches the
construction is plainly shown, and of course is far lighter.In them
also colour almost wholly supersedes carving.The peculiarities of these
two styles are well illustrated in the two Woodcuts, Nos.379 and 380,
from churches near Kostroma in Eastern Russia.Both belong to the Middle
Ages, and both are favourable specimens of their respective classes.In
these examples, as indeed in every Greek church, the principal object of
ecclesiastical furniture is the _iconostasis_ or image-bearer,
corresponding to the rood-screen that separates the choir from the nave
in Latin churches.The rood-screen, however, never assumed in the West
the importance which the iconostasis always possessed in the East.There
it separates and hides from the church the sanctuary and the altar, from
which the laity are wholly excluded.Within it the elements are
consecrated, in the presence of the priests alone, and are then brought
forward to be displayed to the public.On this screen, as performing so
important a part, the Greek architects and artists have lavished the
greatest amount of care and design, and in every Greek church, from St.Mark’s at Venice to the extreme confines of Russia, it is the object
that first attracts attention on entering.It is, in fact, so important
that it must be regarded rather as an object of architecture than of
church furniture.The architectural details of these Russian churches must be pronounced
to be bad; for, even making every allowance for difference of taste,
there is neither beauty of form nor constructive elegance in any part.The most characteristic and pleasing features are the five domes that
generally ornament the roofs, and which, when they rise from the
_extrados_, or uncovered outside of the vaults, certainly look well.Too
frequently, however, the vault is covered by a wooden roof, through
which the domes then peer in a manner by no means to be admired.The
details of the lower part are generally bad.381)
of a doorway of the Troitska monastery, near Moscow, is sufficiently
characteristic.Its most remarkable feature is the baluster-like
pillars, of which the Russians seem so fond.These support an arch with
a pendant in the middle—a sort of architectural _tour de force_ which
the Russian architects practised everywhere and in every age, but which
is far from being beautiful in itself, or from possessing any
architectural propriety.The great roll over the door is also
unpleasant.Indeed, as a general rule, wherever in Russian architecture
the details are original, they must be condemned as ugly.At Moscow we find much that is at all events curious.It first became a
city of importance about the year 1304, and retained its prosperity
throughout that century.During that time it was adorned by many
sumptuous edifices.In the beginning of the 15th century it was taken
and destroyed by the Tartars, and it was not till the reign of Ivan III.(1462-1505) that the city and empire recovered the disasters of that
period.It is extremely doubtful if any edifice now found in Moscow can
date before the time of this monarch.In the year 1479 this king dedicated the new church of the Assumption of
the Virgin, said to have been built by Aristotile Fioravanti, of
Bologna, in Italy, who was brought to Russia expressly for the purpose.382) gives a good idea of the arrangement of
a Russian church of this age.Small as are its dimensions—only 74 ft.by
56 over all externally, which would be a very small parish church
anywhere else—the two other cathedrals of Moscow, that of the Archangel
Michael and the Annunciation, are even smaller still in plan.Like true
Byzantine churches, they would all be exact squares, but that the
narthex being taken into the church gives it a somewhat oblong form.In
the Church of the Assumption there is, as is almost universally the
case, one large dome over the centre of the square, and four smaller
ones in the four angles.[255] The great iconostasis runs, as at Sta.Sophia at Kief, quite across the church; but the two lateral chapels
have smaller screens inside which hide their altars, so that the part
between the two becomes a sort of private chapel.This seems to be the
plan of the greater number of the Russian churches of this age.Doorway of the Troitzka Monastery, near Moscow.]Plan of the Church of the Assumption, Moscow.]View of the Church of Vassili Blanskenoy, Moscow.]But there is one church in Moscow, that of Vassili (St.Basil) Blajenny,
which is certainly the most remarkable, as it is the most
characteristic, of all the churches of Russia.It was built by Ivan the
Terrible (1534-1584), and its architect was a foreigner, generally
supposed to have come from the West, inasmuch as this monarch sent an
embassy to Germany under one Schlit, to procure artists, of whom he is
said to have collected 150 for his service.If, however, German workmen
erected this building, it certainly was from Tartar designs.Nothing
like it exists to the westward.It more resembles some Eastern pagoda of
modern date than any European structure, and in fact must be considered
as almost a pure Tartar building.Still, though strangely altered by
time, most of its forms can be traced back to the Byzantine style, as
certainly as the details of the cathedral of Cologne to the Romanesque.The central spire, for instance, is the form into which the Russians had
during five centuries been gradually changing the straight-lined dome of
the Armenians.The eight others are the Byzantine domes converted by
degrees into the bulb-like forms which the Tartars practised at Agra and
Delhi, as well as throughout Russia.The arrangement of these domes will
be understood by the plan (Woodcut No.383), which shows it to consist
of one central octagon surrounded by eight smaller ones, raised on a
platform ascended by two flights of stairs.Beneath the platform is a
crypt.For the general appearance the reader must be referred to Woodcut
No.384, for words would fail to convey any idea of so bizarre and
complicated a building.At the same time it must be imagined as painted
with the most brilliant colours; its domes gilt, and relieved by blue,
green, and red, and altogether a combination of as much barbarity as it
is possible to bring together in so small a space.To crown the whole,
according to the legend, Ivan ordered the eyes of the architect to be
put out, lest he should ever surpass his own handiwork; and we may feel
grateful that nothing so barbarous was afterwards attempted in Europe.View of Church at Kurtea d’Argyisch.(From ‘Jahrbuch
der Central Com.’)]

[Illustration: 386.Plan of Church at Kurtea d’Argyisch.Tower of Ivan Veliki, Moscow, with the Cathedrals of
the Assumption and the Archangel Gabriel.]Though not strictly speaking in Russia itself, there is at Kurtea
d’Argyisch, in Wallachia, 90 miles north-west from Bucharest, a church
which is so remarkable, so typical of the style, that it cannot be
passed over.It was erected in the first years of the 16th century
(1517-1526) by a Prince Nyagon, and is, so far as is at present known,
the most elaborate example of the style.All its ornamental details are
identical with those found at Ani and other places in Armenia, but are
used here in greater profusion and with better judgment than are to be
found in any single example in that country.In outline it is not so
wild as the Vassili Blanskenoy, but the interior is wholly sacrificed to
the external effect, and no other example can well be quoted on which
ornamental construction is carried to so great an extent, and generally
speaking in such good taste.The twisted cupolas that flank the
entrances might as well have been omitted, but the two central domes and
the way the semi-domes are attached to them are quite unexceptionable,
and altogether, with larger dimensions, and if a little more spread out,
it would be difficult to find a more elegant exterior anywhere.long by 50 wide it is too small for architectural effect,
but barring this it is the most elegant example of the Armeno-Russian or
Neo-Byzantine architecture which is known to exist anywhere, and one of
the most suggestive, if the Russians knew how to use it.[256]


                                TOWERS.Next in importance to the churches themselves are the belfries which
always accompany them.The Russians seem never to have adopted separate
baptisteries, nor did they affect any sepulchral magnificence in their
tombs.From the time of Herodotus the Scythians were great casters of
metal, and famous for their bells.The specimens of casting of this sort
in Russia reduce all the great bells of Western Europe to comparative
insignificance.It of course became necessary to provide places in which
to hang these bells: and as nothing, either in Byzantine or Armenian
architecture, afforded a hint for amalgamating the belfry with the
church, they went to work in their own way, and constructed the towers
wholly independent of the churches.Of all those in Russia, that of Ivan
Veliki, erected by the Czar Boris, about the year 1600, is the finest.It is surmounted by a cross 18 ft.high, making a total height of 269
ft.from the ground to the top of the cross.It cannot be said to have
any great beauty, either of form or detail: but it rises boldly from the
ground, and towers over all the other buildings of the Kremlin.With
this tower for its principal object, the whole mass of building is at
least picturesque, if not architecturally beautiful.388) the belfry is shown as it stood before it was blown up by the
French.It has since been rebuilt, and with the cathedrals on either
hand, makes up the best group in the Kremlin.Besides the belfries, the walls of the Kremlin are adorned with towers,
meant not merely for military defence, but as architectural ornaments,
and reminding us somewhat of those described by Josephus as erected by
Herod on the walls of Jerusalem.389),
built by the same Czar Boris who erected that last described, is a good
specimen of its class.It is one of the principal of those which give
the walls of the Kremlin their peculiar and striking character.These towers, however, are not peculiar to the Kremlin of Moscow.Every
city in Russia had its Kremlin, as every one in Spain had its Alcazar,
and all were adorned with walls deeply machicolated, and interspersed
with towers.Within were enclosed five-domed churches and belfries, just
as at Moscow, though on a scale proportionate to the importance of the
city.It would be easy to select numerous illustrations of this.They
are, however, all very much like one another, nor have they sufficient
beauty to require us to dwell long on them.Their gateways, however, are
frequently important.Every city had its _porta sacra_, deriving its
importance either from some memorable event or from miracles said to
have been wrought there, and being the triumphal gateways through which
all processions pass on state occasions.The best known of these is that of Moscow, beneath whose sacred arch
even the Emperor himself must uncover his head as he passes through; and
which, from its sanctity as well as its architectural character, forms
an important feature among the antiquities of Russia.So numerous are the churches, and, generally speaking, the fragments of
antiquity in this country, that it would be easy to multiply examples to
almost any extent.Those quoted in the preceding pages are,
architecturally, the finest as well as the most interesting from an
antiquarian point of view, of those which have yet been visited and
drawn; and there is no reason to believe that others either more
magnificent or more beautiful still remain undescribed.This being the case, it is safe to assert that Russia contains nothing
that can at all compare with the cathedrals, or even the parish
churches, of Western Europe, either in dimensions or in beauty of
detail.Every chapter in the history of architecture must contain
something to interest the student: but there is none less worthy of
attention than that which describes the architecture of Russia,
especially when we take into account the extent of territory occupied by
its people, and the enormous amount of time and wealth which has been
lavished on the multitude of insignificant buildings to be found in
every corner of the empire.CHAPTER I.

                             INTRODUCTORY.Division and Classification of the Romanesque and Gothic Styles of
  Architecture in Italy.If a historian were to propose to himself the task of writing a
tolerably consecutive narrative of the events which occurred in Italy
during the Middle Ages, he would probably find such difficulties in his
way as would induce him to abandon the attempt.Venice and Genoa were as
distinct states as Spain and Portugal.Florence, the most essentially
Italian of the republics, requires a different treatment from the half
German Milan.Even such neighbouring cities as Mantua and Verona were
separate and independent states during the most important part of their
existence.Rome was, during the whole of the Middle Ages, more European
than Italian, and must have a narrative of her own; Southern Italy was a
foreign country to the states of the North; and Sicily has an
independent history.The same difficulties, though not perhaps to the same degree, beset the
historian of art, and, if it were proposed to describe in detail all the
varying forms of Italian art during the Middle Ages, it would be
necessary to map out Italy into provinces, and to treat each almost as a
separate kingdom by itself.In this, as in almost every instance,
however, the architecture forms a better guide-line through the tangled
mazes of the labyrinth than the written record of political events, and
those who can read her language have before them a more trustworthy and
vivid picture of the past than can be obtained by any other means.The great charm of the history of Mediæval art in England is its unity.It affords the picture of a people working out a style from chaos to
completeness, with only slight assistance from those in foreign
countries engaged in the same task.In France we have two elements, the
old Southern Romanesque long struggling with the Northern Celtic, and
unity only obtained by the suppression of the former, wherever they came
in contact.In Italy we have four elements,—the Roman, the Byzantine,
the Lombardic, and the Gothic,—sometimes existing nearly pure, at others
mixed, in the most varying proportions, the one with the other.In the North the Lombardic element prevailed; based on the one hand on
the traditions of Imperial Rome, and in consequence influenced in its
art by classical forms; and, on the other, inspired in all its details
by a vast accumulation of Byzantine work.In the 5th and 6th centuries
this work (chiefly confined to columns, screens, and altar pieces) was
executed by Greek artists sent on from Constantinople.The 7th century
seems to have been quite barren so far as architecture was concerned;
but in the 8th century, owing either to the Saracen invasion or to the
emigration caused by the persecution of the Iconoclasts in 788, the
Byzantine influence became again predominant, but no longer with that
same purity of design as we find in the earlier work of the 5th and 6th
centuries.In the South, the Byzantine forms prevailed, partly because the art was
there based on the traditions of Magna Grecia, and more, perhaps, from
the intimate connection that existed between Apulia and the Peloponnesus
during the Middle Ages.Between the two stood Rome, less changed than either North or South—the
three terms, Roman, Romano-Byzantine, and Renaissance comprise all the
variation she submitted to.In vain the Gothic styles besieged her on
the north and the Byzantine on the south.Their waves spent themselves
on her rock without producing much impression, while her influence
extended more or less over the whole peninsula.It was distinctly felt
at Florence and at Pisa on the north and west, though these conquests
were nearly balanced by the Byzantine influence which is so distinctly
felt at Venice or Padua on the east coast.The great difficulty in the attempt to reconcile these architectural
varieties with the local and ethnographical peculiarities of the
people—a difficulty which at first sight appears all but insuperable—is,
that sometimes all three styles are found side by side in the same city.This, however, constitutes, in reality, the intrinsic merit of
architecture as a guide in these difficulties.What neither the language
of the people nor their histories tell us, their arts proclaim in a
manner not to be mistaken.Just in that ratio in which the Roman,
Byzantine, or Lombardic style prevails in their churches, to that extent
did either of these elements exist in the blood of the people.Once
thoroughly master the peculiarities of their art, and we can with
certainty pronounce when any particular race rose to power, how long its
prevalence lasted, and when it was obliterated or fused with some other
form.There is no great difficulty in distinguishing between the Byzantine and
the other two styles, so far as the form of dome is concerned.The
latter is almost always rounded externally, the former almost always
straight-lined.Again: the Byzantine architects never used intersecting
vaults for their naves.If forced to use a pointed arch, they did so
unwillingly, and it never fitted kindly to their favourite circular
forms; the style of their ornamentation was throughout peculiar, and
differed in many essential respects from the other two styles.It is less easy always to discriminate between the Gothic and Lombardic
in Italy.We frequently find churches of the two styles built side by
side in the same age, both using round arches, and with details not
differing essentially from one another.There is one test, however,
which is probably in all cases sufficient.Every Gothic church had, or
was intended to have, a vault over its central aisle.The importance of the distinction is apparent
throughout.The Gothic churches have clustered piers, tall
vaulting-shafts, external and internal buttresses, and are prepared
throughout for this necessity of Gothic art.The early Christian
churches, on the contrary, have only a range of columns, generally of a
pseudo-Corinthian order, between the central and side aisles; internally
no vaulting-shafts, and externally only pilasters.Had these architects
been competent, as the English were, to invent an ornamental wooden
roof, they would perhaps have acted wisely; but though they made several
attempts, especially at Verona, they failed signally to devise any mode
either of hiding the mere mechanical structure of their roofs or of
rendering them ornamental.Vaulting was, in fact, the real formative idea of the Gothic style, and
it continued to be its most marked characteristic during the continuance
of the style, not only in Italy, but throughout all Europe.As it is impossible to treat of these various styles in one sequence,
various modes of precedence might be adopted, for each of which good
reasons could be given; but the following will probably be found most
consonant with the arrangement elsewhere adopted in this work:—

First, to treat of the early Christian style as it prevailed in Italy
down to the age of Charlemagne, and to trace out its history down to the
11th century, in order to include all that work executed by Greek
artists or copied from it by Lombardic artists; a phase which might
appropriately be termed the Byzantine-Lombardic style.Secondly, to follow the history of the formation of the round-arched
style in Lombardy and North Italy, which constitutes the real Lombardic
style.Thirdly, to take up the Byzantine-Romanesque style as it was practised
in the centre and South of Italy; because it follows chronologically
more closely the art of the North of Italy.Fourthly, to follow the changes which the influence of the Gothic style
exercised in the 13th and 14th centuries in Italy.Sicily will demand a chapter to herself; not only because a fourth
element is introduced there in the Saracenic—which influenced her style
almost as much as it did that of the South of Spain—but because such
pointed Gothic as she possesses was not German, like that of Northern
Italy, but derived far more directly from France, under either the
Norman or Angiovine dynasties.Gothic architecture in Palestine also
requires a chapter, and is best described here owing to its close
resemblance to the style in the South of Italy.EARLY CHRISTIAN AND BYZANTINE-LOMBARDIC STYLES.Paul’s—Ravenna—St.Mark’s,

                               BASILICAS.Like the study of all modern history, that of Christian architecture
commences with Rome; and not, as is sometimes supposed, where the
history of Rome leaves off, but far back in the Empire, if not, indeed,
almost in the Republic.As has already been pointed out, the whole history of the art in
Imperial Rome is that of a style in course of transition, beginning with
a purely Pagan or Grecian style in the age of Augustus, and passing into
one almost wholly Christian in the age of Constantine.At the first epoch of the Empire the temple architecture of Rome
consisted in an external arrangement of columns, without arches or
vaults, and was wholly unsuited for the purposes of Christian worship.Towards the end of the period it had become an internal architecture,
making use of arches and vaults almost entirely to the exclusion of the
columnar orders, except as ornaments, and became so perfectly adapted to
Christian requirements, that little or no essential change in it has
taken place from that time to the present day.A basilica of the form
adopted in the first century after Constantine is as suited now as it
was then to the forms and ceremonies of the Christian ritual.The fact seems to be, that during the first three centuries after the
Christian era an immense change was silently but certainly working its
way in men’s minds.The old religion was effete: the best men, the most
intellectual spirits of the age, had no faith in it; and the new
religion with all its important consequences was gradually supplying its
place in the minds of men long before it was generally accepted.There is thus no real distinction between the Emilian or Ulpian
basilicas and those which Constantine erected for the use of the early
Christian republic.Nor is it possible, in such a series as the
Pantheon, the Temple of Minerva Medica, and the Church of San Vitale at
Ravenna, to point out what part really belongs to Pagan and what to
Christian art.It is true that Constantine fixed the epoch of completed transition, and
gave it form and substance; but long before his time Paganism was
impossible and a reform inevitable.The feeling of the world had
changed—its form of utterance followed as a matter of course.Viewed in this light, it is impossible to separate the early history of
Christian art from that of Imperial Rome.The sequence is so immediate
and the change so gradual, that a knowledge of the first is absolutely
indispensable to a right understanding of the second.One of the most remarkable facts connected with the early history of the
Christian religion is, that neither its Founder nor any of His more
immediate successors left any specific directions either as to the
liturgical forms of worship to be observed by His followers, nor laid
down any rules to be observed in the government of the newly established
Church.Under these circumstances it was left almost wholly to those to
whose care the infant congregation was entrusted to frame such
regulations for its guidance as the exigencies of the occasion might
dictate, and gradually to appoint such forms of worship as might seem
most suitable to express the purity of the new faith, but at the same
time with a dignity befitting its high mission.In Judea these ceremonies, as might naturally be expected, were strongly
tinctured with the forms of the Mosaic dispensation; but it appears to
have been in Africa, and more especially in the pomp-loving and
ceremonious Egypt, that fixed liturgies and rites first became an
integral part of the Christian religion.In those countries far from the
central seat of government, more liberty of conscience seems to have
been attained at an early period than would have been tolerated in the
capital.Before the time of Constantine they possessed not only
churches, but a regularly established hierarchy and a form of worship
similar to what afterwards obtained throughout the whole Christian
world.The form of the government of the Church, however, was long
unsettled.At first it seems merely to have been that the most respected
individuals of each isolated congregation were selected to form a
council to advise and direct their fellow-Christians, to receive and
dispense their alms, and, under the simple but revered title of
Presbyters, to act as fathers rather than as governors to the scattered
communities by which they were elected.The idea, however, of such a
council naturally includes that of a president to guide their
deliberations and give unity and force to their decisions; and such we
soon find springing up under the title of Bishops, or Presbyter Bishops,
as they were first called.During the course of the second century the
latter institution seems gradually to have gained strength at the
expense of the power of the Presbyters, whose delegate the Bishop was
assumed to be.In that capacity the Bishops not only took upon
themselves the general direction of the affairs of the Church, but
formed themselves into separate councils and synods, meeting in the
provincial capitals of the provinces where they were located.These
meetings took place under the presidency of the Bishop of the city in
which they met, who thus assumed to be the chief or metropolitan.These
formed a new presbytery above the older institution, which was thus
gradually superseded—to be again surpassed by the great councils which,
after the age of Constantine, formed the supreme governing body of the
Church; performing the functions of the earlier provincial synods with
more extended authority, though with less unanimity and regularity than
had characterised the earlier institution.It was thus that during the first three centuries of its existence the
Christian community was formed into a vast federal republic, governed by
its own laws, administered by its own officers, acknowledging no
community with the heathen and no authority in the constituted secular
powers of the State.But at the same time the hierarchy admitted a
participation of rights to the general body of the faithful, from whom
they were chosen, and whose delegation was still admitted to be their
title to office.When, in the time of Constantine, this persecuted and scattered Church
emerged from the Catacombs to bask in the sunshine of Imperial favour,
there were no buildings in Rome, the plan of which was more suited to
their purposes than that of the basilicas of the ancient city.Though
designed and erected for the transaction of the affairs of the heathen
Empire, they happened to be, in consequence of their disposition and
immense size, eminently suited for the convenience of the Christian
Church, which then aspired to supersede its fallen rival and replace it
by a younger and better institution.[257]

In the basilica the whole congregation of the faithful could meet and
take part in the transaction of the business going on.The bishop
naturally took the place previously occupied by the prætor or quæstor,
the presbyters those of the assessors.The altar in front of the apse,
where the pious heathen poured out libations at the commencement and
conclusion of all important business, served equally for the celebration
of Christian rites, and with the fewest possible changes, either in the
form of the ceremonies or in the nature of the business transacted
therein, the basilica of the heathen became the ecclesia or place of
assembly of the early Christian community.In addition, however, to the rectangular basilica, which was essentially
the place of meeting for the transaction of the business of the Church,
the Christian community early adopted a circular-formed edifice as a
ceremonial or sacramental adjunct to the basilica.These were copied
from the Roman tombs above described, and were in fact frequently built
for the sepulchres of distinguished persons; but they were also used at
a very early date as baptisteries, as well as for the performance of
funereal rites.It does not appear that baptism, the marriage rites, or
indeed any of the sacraments, were performed in the earliest ages in the
basilica, though in after ages a font was introduced even into
cathedrals.The rectangular church became ultimately the only form used.In the earlier ages, however, a complete ecclesiastical establishment
consisted of a basilica, and a baptistery, independent of one another
and seldom ranged symmetrically, though the tendency seems to have been
to place the round church opposite the western or principal entrance of
the basilica.Though this was the case in the capital and other great cities, it was
otherwise before the time of Constantine in the provinces.There the
Christian communities existed as members of a religious sect long before
they aspired to political power or dreamt of superseding the secular
form of government by combination among themselves.In the remote parts
of the Empire, in the earliest ages, they consequently built for
themselves churches which were temples, or, in other words, houses of
prayer, designed for and devoted wholly to the celebration of religious
rites, as in the Pagan temples, and without any reference to the
government of the community or the transaction of the business of the
assembly.If any such existed in Italy or any other part of Europe, they
either perished in the various persecutions to which the Christians were
exposed when located near the seat of government, or they became
hallowed by the memories of the times of martyrdom, and were rebuilt in
happier days with greater magnificence, so that little or no trace of
the original buildings now remains.So long, therefore, as our
researches were confined to European examples, the history of Christian
architecture began with Constantine; but recent researches in Africa
have shown that, when properly explored, we shall certainly be able to
carry the history of the early Christian style in that country back to a
date at least a century before his time.In Syria and Asia Minor so many
early examples have come to light that it seems probable that we may,
before long, carry the history of Byzantine art back to a date nearly
approaching that of the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus.It is,
however, only so recently that the attention of ecclesiologists has been
directed to the early examples of Christian architecture, that it is not
yet possible to grasp completely the whole bearing of the subject; but
enough is known to show how much the progress of research may modify the
views hitherto entertained on the subject.Meanwhile too much attention
can hardly be bestowed upon it, as it is by means of these early
specimens of architectural art that we shall probably be best able to
recover the primitive forms of the Christian liturgical observance.One of the most ancient as well as interesting of the African churches
which has yet been brought to light is that at Djemla.It is a simple
rectangle, internally 92 ft.by 52, divided longitudinally with three
aisles, the centre one of which terminates in a square cella or choir,
which seems to have been enclosed up to the roof; but the building is so
ruined that this cannot be known for a certainty.Though so exceptional,
it is not difficult to see whence the form was derived.If we take such
a plan, for instance, as that of the Maison Carré at Nîmes (Woodcut No.187), and build a wall round and put a roof over it, so as to make a
building which was originally appropriated to external worship suitable
for internal religious purposes, we should have exactly such a result as
this.The cella must be diminished in extent, the pillars more widely
spaced, and the front row converted into a wall in which the entrances
would be usually placed.In this instance the one entrance, for some
local reason, is lateral.The whole floor of the church is covered with
a mosaic so purely classical in style of execution as to leave no doubt
as to its early date.A more common form is shown in the annexed woodcut, representing a small
church at Announa, likewise in Algeria, about 45 ft.square, divided
into three aisles and with a projecting apse.If we turn to the plan of
the Temple of Mars Ultor (Woodcut No.186), we see at once whence this
form was derived.It only requires the lateral columns to be brought
slightly forward to effect the requisite change.When the building was
to be used by a congregation, and not merely for display, the pillars
would require to be more widely spaced.A third form, from Ibrim in Nubia, shows the peculiarity of the apse
being internal, which became very fashionable in the Eastern, though not
so much so in the Western, churches, but still sufficiently so to make
its introduction at this early age worthy of notice.The building is
small, being only 57 ft.in length externally, but is remarkable for
being built with something of the solidity of the Egyptian edifices
among which it stands.The next example which it may be necessary to quote to make this early
form intelligible, is that of the church of St.Reparatus, near
Orleansville—the ancient Castellum Tingitanum.According to an
inscription still existing, it was erected A.D.252,[258] but the second
apse seems to have been added at a later date, to contain the grave of
the saint.As it now stands, it is a double-apsed basilica 80 ft.long
by 52 broad, divided into five aisles, and exhibiting on a miniature
scale all the peculiarities of plan which we have hitherto fancied were
not adopted until some centuries later.In this instance both the apses
are internal, so that the side-aisles are longer than the centre one, no
portion of them appearing to have been cut off for chalcidica or
vestries, as was very generally the case in this age.Another example, very much like this in arrangement, but on a larger
scale, is found at Ermet, the ancient Hermonthis in Egypt.by 90, and, if the plan in the great French work[259]
is to be depended upon, is one of the most complete examples of its
class.It has four ranges of columns, taken apparently from more ancient
examples, and two apses with all the usual appurtenances.Plan of Church at Ibrim in Nubia.Another two-aisled and single apse church, measuring 100 ft.by 65,
called Dyer Abou Taneh, is represented in the same work;[260] but
perhaps the most interesting of these churches is that known as the
White Convent, situated on the edge of the Libyan Desert, above Siout.by 122, and is enclosed in a solid wall,
surmounted by an Egyptian cornice, so that it looks much more like an
ancient temple than a Christian church.Originally it had six doors, but
all are now walled up, except one in the centre of the southern face;
and above, a series of small openings, like loopholes, admitted light to
apartments which apparently occupied the upper storey of lateral
corridors.Light to the church was, of course, admitted through the
clerestory, which could easily be done; and altogether as a fortified
and mysterious abode, and place of worship of ascetics, it would be
difficult to find a more appropriate example.The age of this church is not very well ascertained; popularly it is,
like so many others, ascribed to Sta.Helena, and the double aisles and
triapsal arrangements are so like her church at Bethlehem, that there is
no _à priori_ improbability in the assumption.The plan, however, is
more complicated and complete, and its external form bespeaks of
troublous times, so that altogether it is probably a century or two (the
monks say 140 years) more modern.Like other churches of its class,
ancient materials have been so used up with those prepared at the time,
that it is extremely difficult to ascertain the dates of such buildings.If, however, any one with sufficient knowledge would make a special
study of these Egyptian churches, he would add one of the most
interesting chapters to our history of early Christian Architecture, and
explain many ritual arrangements whose origin is now involved in
mystery; but for this we must wait.The materials are not at present
available, all travellers in Egypt being so attracted by the surpassing
interest of the Pagan remains of that country, as hardly to find time
for a glance at the Christian antiquities.[261]

[Illustration: 394.It was probably in a great measure owing to the influence of these
provincial examples that the arrangements of the metropolitan basilicas
were not long allowed to retain the form above described, though more
was probably due to the change which was gradually taking place in the
constitution of the governing body of the Church.The early arrangements
of the Christian basilica, as copied from the secular forms of the Pagan
places of assembly, soon became unsuited to the more exclusively
religious purposes to which they were to be appropriated.The now
dominant hierarchy of Rome soon began to repudiate the republicanism of
the early days of the Church, and to adopt from the East the convenient
doctrine of the absolute separation of the congregation into clergy and
laity.To accommodate the basilica to this new state of things, first
the apse was railed off and appropriated wholly to the use of the
clergy: then the whole of the dais, or raised part in front of the apse
on which the altar stood, was separated by pillars, called cancelli, and
in like manner given up wholly to the clergy, and was not allowed to be
profaned by the presence of the unordained multitude.The last great change was the introduction of a choir, or enclosed space
in the centre of the nave, attached to the bema or _presbytery_, as the
raised space came to be called.Round three sides of this choir the
faithful were allowed to congregate to hear the Gospels or Epistles read
from the two pulpits or _ambones_, which were built into its enclosure,
one on either side; or to hear the services which were read or sung by
the inferior order of clergy who occupied its precincts.The enclosure of the choir was kept low, so as not to hide the view of
the raised presbytery, or to prevent the congregation from witnessing
the more sacred mysteries of the faith which were there performed by the
higher order of clergy.Another important modification, though it entailed no architectural
change, was the introduction of the bodies of the saints in whose honour
the building was erected into the basilica itself, and depositing them
in a confessional or crypt below the high altar.There is every reason to believe that a separate circular building, or
proper tomb, was originally erected over the grave or place of
martyrdom, and the basilica was sanctified merely by its propinquity to
the sacred spot.Afterwards the practice of depositing the relics of the
saint beneath the floor became universally the rule.At about the same
time the baptistery was also absorbed into the basilica; and instead of
standing opposite the western entrance, a font placed within the western
doors supplied its place.This last change was made earlier at Rome than
elsewhere.It is not known at what exact period the alteration was
introduced, but it is probable that the whole was completed before the
age of Gregory the Great.It was thus that in the course of a few centuries the basilicas
aggregated within themselves all the offices of the Roman Church, and
became the only acknowledged ecclesiastical buildings—either as places
for the assembly of the clergy for the administration of the sacraments
and the performance of divine worship, or for the congregation of the
faithful.None of the basilican churches, either of Rome or the provinces, possess
these arrangements exactly as they were originally established in the
fourth or fifth century.The church of San Clemente, however, retains
them so nearly in their primitive form that a short description of it
may tend to make what follows more easily intelligible.This basilica
seems to have been erected in the fourth or fifth century over what was
supposed to be the house in which the saint of that name resided.Recently a subterranean church or crypt has been discovered, which must
of course be more ancient than the present remains.[262] Above this
subterranean church stands the edifice shown in the accompanying plan
(Woodcut No.395), nearly one-third less in size, being only 65 ft.wide
internally, against 93 of the original church, though both were about
the same length.Plan of the Church of San Clemente at Rome.(From
Gutensohn and Knapp.to 1 in]

It is one of the few that still possesses an _atrium_ or courtyard in
front of the principal entrance, though there can be but little doubt
that this was considered at that early age a most important, if not
indeed an indispensable, attribute to the church itself.As a feature it
may have been derived from the East, where we know it was most common,
and where it afterwards became, with only the slightest possible
modifications, the mosque of the Moslems.It would seem even more
probable, however, that it is only a repetition of the _forum_, which
was always attached to the Pagan basilica, and through which it was
always entered; and for a sepulchral church at least nothing could be
more appropriate, as the original application of the word forum seems to
have been to the open area that existed in front of tombs as well as of
other important buildings.[264]

In the centre of this atrium there generally stood a fountain or tank of
water, not only as an emblem of purity, but that those who came to the
church might wash their hands before entering the holy place—a custom
which seems to have given rise to the practice of dipping the fingers in
the holy water of the piscina, now universal in all Catholic countries.The colonnade next the church was frequently the only representative of
the atrium, and then—perhaps indeed always—was called the _narthex_, or
place for penitents or persons who had not yet acquired the right of
entering the church itself.From this narthex three doorways generally opened into the church,
corresponding with the three aisles; and if the building possessed a
font, it ought to have been placed in one of the chapels on either the
right or left hand of the principal entrance.The choir, with its two pulpits, is shown in the plan—that on the
left-hand side being the pulpit of the Epistle, that on the right of the
Gospel.The railing of the _bema_ or presbytery is also marked, so is
the position of the altar with its canopy supported on four pillars, and
behind that the throne of the bishop, with the seats of the inferior
clergy surrounding the apse on either side.Besides the church of San Clemente there are at least thirty other
basilican churches in Rome, extending in date from the 4th to the 14th
century.Their names and dates, as far as they have been ascertained,
are set forth in the accompanying list, which, though not altogether
complete, is still the best we possess, and is sufficient for our
present purpose.[265]

Three of these, St.Paul’s, and the Lateran church, have
five aisles, all the rest three, with only one insignificant exception,
Sta.Balbina, which has no side-aisles.Agnes and the old part
of St.Lorenzo, have their side-aisles in two storeys, all the rest are
only one storey in height, and the side-aisles generally are half the
width of the central aisle or nave.Some of the more modern churches
have the side-aisles vaulted, but of those in the list all except the
two last have flat wooden ceilings over the central compartment, and
generally speaking the plain ornamental construction of the roof is
exposed.It can scarcely be doubted that originally they were ceiled in
some more ornamental manner, as the art of ornamenting this new style of
open construction seems to have been introduced at a later date.(From Gutensohn and Knapp.)Maria sopra Minerva might perhaps be
more properly classed among the buildings belonging to the Italian
Gothic style; but as it is the only one in Rome that has any claim to
such a distinction, it is hardly worth while making it an exception to
the rest.The San Agostino might also be called a Renaissance specimen.It certainly is a transitional specimen between the pillared and
pilastered styles, which were then struggling for mastery.It may either
be regarded as the last of the old race or the first of the new style,
which was so soon destined to revolutionise the architectural world.Of the other examples the oldest was the finest.This great basilica was
erected in the reign of Constantine, close to the circus of Nero, where
tradition affirmed that St.It
unfortunately was entirely swept away to make room for the greatest of
Christian temples, which now occupies its site; but previous to its
destruction careful measurements and drawings were made of every part,
from which it is easy to understand all its arrangements—easier perhaps
than if it had remained to the present day, and four centuries more of
reform and improvements had assisted in altering and disfiguring its
venerable frame.As will be seen in the plan (Woodcut No.396), drawn to the usual scale,
it possessed a noble atrium or forecourt, 212 ft.by 235, in front of
which were some bold masses of building, which, during the Middle Ages,
were surmounted by two belfry-towers.in
width by 380 in length, covering, without its adjuncts, an area of above
80,000 English feet, which, though less than half the size of the
present cathedral, is as large as that covered by any mediæval cathedral
except those of Milan and Seville.across (about twice the average width of a Gothic nave), and nearly the
same as that of the basilica of Maxentius and the principal halls of the
greater thermæ.For some reason or other this dimension seems to have
been a modulus very generally adopted.The bema or sanctuary, answering
to the Gothic transept, extended beyond the walls of the church either
way, which was unusual in early Christian buildings.The object here
seems to have been to connect it with the tombs on its north side.The
arrangement of the sanctuary was also peculiar, having been adorned with
twelve pillars supporting a gallery.These, when symbolism became the
fashion, were said to represent the twelve apostles.This certainly was
not their original intent, as at first only six were put up—the others
added afterwards.The sanctuary and choir were here singularly small and
contracted, as if arranged before the clergy became so numerous as they
afterwards were, and before the laity were excluded from this part of
the church.The general internal appearance of the building will be understood from
the following woodcut (No.397), which presents at one view all the
peculiarities of the basilican buildings.The pillars separating the
central from the side aisles appear to have been of uniform dimensions,
and to have supported a horizontal entablature, above which rose a
double range of panels, each containing a picture—these panels thus
taking the place of what was the triforium in Gothic churches.Over
these was the clerestory, and again an ornamental belt gave sufficient
elevation for the roof, which in this instance showed the naked
construction.On the whole perhaps the ratio of height to width is
unexceptionable, but the height over the pillars is so great that they
are made to look utterly insignificant, which indeed is the great defect
in the architectural design of these buildings, and, though seldom so
offensive as here, is apparent in all.The ranges of columns dividing
the side-aisles were joined by arches, which is a more common as well as
a better arrangement, as it not only adds to the height of the pillars,
but gives them an apparent power of bearing the superstructure.At some
period during the Middle Ages the outer aisles were vaulted, and Gothic
windows introduced into them.This change seems to have necessitated the
closing of the intermediate range of clerestory windows, which probably
was by no means conducive to the general architectural effect of the
building.Peter, before its
destruction in the 15th century.Externally this basilica, like all those of its age, must have been
singularly deficient in beauty or in architectural design.The sides
were of plain unplastered brick, the windows were plain arch-headed
openings.The front alone was ornamented, and this only with two ranges
of windows somewhat larger than those at the sides, three in each tier,
into which tracery was inserted at some later period, and between and
above these, various figures and emblems were painted in fresco on
stucco laid on the brickwork.The whole was surmounted by that singular
coved cornice which seems to have been universal in Roman basilicas,
though not found anywhere else that I am aware of.The two most interesting adjuncts to this cathedral were the two tombs
standing to the northward.According to the mediæval tradition the one
was the tomb of Honorius and his wives, the other the church of St.Their position, however, carefully centred on the spina of the
circus of Nero, where the great apostle suffered martyrdom, seems to
point to a holier and more important origin.My own conviction is that
they were erected to mark the places where the apostle and his
companions suffered.It is besides extremely improbable that after the
erection of the basilica an emperor should choose the centre of a circus
for the burying-place of himself and his family, or that he should be
permitted to choose so hallowed a spot.They are of exactly the usual
tomb-form of the age of Constantine, and of the largest size, being each
100 ft.The first was destroyed by Michael Angelo, as it stood on the site
required for his northern tribune, the second by Pius VI., in 1776, to
make way for the present sacristy, and Rome thus lost, through pure
carelessness, the two oldest and most sacred edifices of the Christian
period which she possessed.The most eastern had been so altered and overlaid, having been long used
as a sacristy,[266] that it might have been difficult to restore it; but
its position and its antiquity certainly entitled it to a better fate.The church of San Paolo fuori le Mura was almost an exact counterpart of
St.Peter’s both in design and dimensions.The only important variations
were that the transept was made of the same width as the central nave,
or about 80 ft., and that the pillars separating the nave from the
side-aisles were joined by arches instead of by a horizontal architrave.Both these were undoubted improvements, the first giving space and
dignity to the bema, the latter not only adding height to the order, but
giving it, together with lightness, that apparent strength requisite to
support the high wall placed over the pillars.Paul’s, at Rome, before
the fire.]The order too was finer and more important than at St.Peter’s,
twenty-four of the pillars being taken from some temple or building (it
is generally said the mausoleum of Hadrian) of the best age of Rome,
though the remaining sixteen were unfortunately only very bad copies of
them.in height, or one-third of the whole
height of the building to the roof.Peter’s they were only a
fourth, and if they had been spaced a little farther apart, and the arch
made more important, the most glaring defect of these buildings would in
a great measure have been avoided.Long before its destruction by fire in 1822 this church had been so
altered as to lose many of its most striking peculiarities.The bema or
presbytery was divided into two by a longitudinal wall.The greater
number of its clerestory windows were built up, its atrium gone, and
decay and whitewash had done much to efface its beauty, which
nevertheless seems to have struck all travellers with admiration, as
combining in itself the last reminiscence of Pagan Rome with the
earliest forms of the Christian world.It certainly was the most
interesting, if not quite the most beautiful, of the Christian
buildings, of that city.[267]

The third five-aisled basilica, that of St.John Lateran, differs in no
essential respect from those just described except in dimensions; it
covers about 60,000 ft., and consequently is inferior in this respect to
the other two.It has been so completely altered in modern times that
its primitive arrangements can now hardly be discerned, nor can their
effect be judged of, even assuming that they were peculiar to it, which,
however, is by no means certain.Like the other two, it appears to have been originally erected by
Constantine, who seems especially to have affected this five-aisled
form.The churches which he erected at Jerusalem and Bethlehem both have
this number of aisles.From the similarity which exists in the design of
all these churches we might easily restore this building, if it were
worth while.Its dimensions can easily be traced, but beyond this
nothing remains of the original erection.Of those with three aisles by far the finest and most beautiful is that
of S. Maria Maggiore, which, notwithstanding the comparative smallness
of its dimensions, is now perhaps the best specimen of its class
remaining.in width by 250 to the
front of the apse; the whole area being about 32,000 ft.: so that it is
little more than half the size of the Lateran church, and between
one-third and one-fourth of that of the other two five-aisled churches.Notwithstanding this, there is great beauty in its internal colonnade,
all the pillars of which are of one design, and bear a most pleasing
proportion to the superstructure.The clerestory too is ornamented with
pilasters and panels, making it a part of the general design; and with
the roof, which is panelled with constructive propriety and simplicity
combined with sufficient richness, serves to make up a whole which gives
a far better and more complete idea of what a basilica either was
originally, or at least might have been, than any other church at Rome.It is true that both the pilasters of the clerestory and the roof are
modern, and in modern times the colonnade has been broken through in two
places; but these defects must be overlooked in judging of the whole.Another defect is that the side-aisles have been vaulted in modern
times, and in such a manner as to destroy the harmony that should exist
between the different parts of the building.In striving to avoid the
defect of making the superstructure too high in proportion to the
columns, the architect has made the central roof too low either for the
width or length of the main aisle.Still the building, as a whole, is—or
rather was before the completion of the rebuilding of St.Paul’s—the
very best of the older wooden-roofed churches of Christendom, and the
best model from which to study the merits and defects of this style of
architecture.(From Gutensohn and
Knapp.)](From Gutensohn and Knapp.)Another mode of getting over the great defect of high walls over the
pillars was adopted, as in St.Agnese, of using a
gallery corresponding with the triforium of Gothic churches.Lorenzo, where this feature first occurs, it would seem to have been
derived from the Eastern Empire, where the custom of providing galleries
for women had long been established; this is rendered probable by the
fact that the sculpture of the capitals carrying the arches of the
triforium is of pure Byzantine character, and by the adoption of what is
virtually a dosseret,[268] or projecting impost above the capital to
carry the arches, which at their springing are considerably wider and
deeper than the abacus of the capital.According to M. Cattaneo[269] the
earliest part of this church is the Eastern end, built by Constantine
(see plan, Woodcut No.403), which first consisted of nave, aisles, and
a Western apse.In the Pontificate of Sixtus III.(432-440) an immense
basilica was added on the Western side with an Eastern apse built back
to back with the original apse; and later on, in 578-590, galleries were
added to the Western church by Pope Pelagius II.In 1226-1227, when Honorius III.restored the whole building, he removed
the two apses, continued the new arcade up to the early Western wall,
and raised the choir of the early church to its present elevation
(Woodcut No.Agnes the galleries may
have been suggested if not required by the peculiarity of the ground,
which was higher on one side than on the other; but whether this was the
true cause of its adoption or not, the effect was most satisfactory, and
had it been persevered in so as to bring the upper colonnade more into
harmony of proportion with the other, it would have been attended with
the happiest results on the style.Whether it was, however, that the
Romans felt the want of the broad plain space for their paintings, or
that they could not bring the upper arches into proportion with the
classical pillars which they made use of, the system was abandoned
almost as soon as adopted, and never came into general use.It should be observed that this arrangement contained the germs of much
that was afterwards reproduced in Gothic churches.The upper gallery,
after many modifications, at last settled into a triforium, and the
pierced stone slabs in the windows became tracery—but before these were
reached a vaulted roof was introduced, and with it all the features of
the style were to a great extent modified.Lorenzo (fuori le
Mura).]Pudentiana is one of the very oldest
and consequently one of the most interesting of those in Rome.It stands
on substructions of ancient Roman date, which probably formed part of
the Thermæ of Novatus or the house of the Senator Pudens, who is
mentioned by St.Paul at the end of his Second Epistle to Timothy, and
with whom he is traditionally said to have resided during his sojourn in
Rome.The vaults beneath the church certainly formed part of a Roman
mansion, so apparently do those buildings, shown on the plan, and placed
behind and on one side of the sanctuary; but whether these were used for
Christian purposes before the erection of the church in the fourth
century is by no means certain.In plan the church remains in all
probability very much as originally designed, its most striking
peculiarity being the segmental form of the apse, which may possibly
have arisen from some peculiar arrangement of the original building.It
was not, however, found to be pleasing in an architectural point of
view, and was not consequently again employed.The annexed section probably represents very nearly the original form of
the nave, though it has been so encrusted with modern accretions as to
render it difficult to ascertain what the first form really was.The
shafts of the pillars may have been borrowed from some older edifice,
but the capitals were clearly designed to support arches, and must
therefore be early Christian (fourth century?), and are among the most
elegant and appropriate specimens of the class now extant.In some instances, as in San Clemente, above alluded to, in San Pietro
in Vincula, and Sta.Maria in Cosmedin, the colonnade is divided into
spaces of three or four intercolumniations by piers of solid masonry,
which give great apparent solidity and strength to the building, but at
the expense of breaking it up into compartments more than is agreeable,
and these destroy that beauty of perspective so pleasing in a continuous
colonnade.This defect seems to have been felt in the Santa Praxede,
where three of these piers are introduced in the length of the
nave,[271] and support each a bold arch thrown across the central aisle.The effect of this might have been most happy, as at San Miniato, near
Florence; but it has been so clumsily managed in the Roman example, as
to be most destructive of all beauty of proportion.Half Section, half Elevation, of the Church of San
Vincenzo alle Tre Fontane.(From Gutensohn and Knapp.)Some of the principal beauties as well as some of the most remarkable
defects of these basilican churches arise from the employment of columns
torn from ancient temples: where this has been done, the beauty of the
marble, and the exquisite sculpture of the capitals and friezes, give a
richness and elegance to the whole that go far to redeem or to hide the
rudeness of the building in which they are encased.But, on the other
hand, the discrepancy between the pillars—Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian
columns being sometimes used side by side—destroys all uniformity, and
the fragmentary character of the entablatures they support is still more
prejudicial to the continuity of the perspective, which should be the
greatest charm of these churches.By degrees, the fertile quarries of
ancient Rome seem to have become entirely exhausted; and as the example
of St.Paul’s proves, the Romans in the fourth century were incapable of
manufacturing even a bad imitation, and were at last forced to adopt
some new plan of supporting their arcades.Nereo ed
Achilleo is, perhaps, the most elegant example of this class, the piers
being light octagons; but the most characteristic, as well as the most
original, is the San Vincenzo alle Tre Fontane, shown in section and
elevation in Woodcut No.It so far deviates from the usual
basilican arrangements as to suggest a later date.It has the same
defect as all the rest—its pier arches being too low, and for which
there is no excuse here—but both internally and externally it shows a
uniformity of design and a desire to make every part ornamental that
produces a very pleasing effect, notwithstanding that the whole is
merely of brick, and that ornament is so sparingly applied as barely to
prevent the building sinking into the class of mere utilitarian
erections.Among the most pleasing architectural features, if they may be so
called, of these churches, are the mosaic pavements that adorn the
greater number.These were always original, being designed for the
buildings in which they are used, and following the arrangement of the
architecture surrounding them.The patterns too are always elegant, and
appropriate to the purpose; and as the colours are in like manner
generally harmoniously blended, they form not only a most appropriate
but most beautiful basement to the architecture.A still more important feature was the great mosaic picture that always
adorned the semi-dome of the apse, representing most generally the
Saviour seated in glory surrounded by saints, or else some scene from
the life of the holy personage to whom the church was dedicated.These mosaics were generally continued down to nearly the level of the
altar, and along the whole of the inner wall of the sanctuary in which
the apse was situated, and as far as the triumphal arch which separated
the nave from the sanctuary, at which point the mosaic blended with the
frescoes that adorned the upper walls of the central nave above the
arcades.All this made up an extent of polychromatic decoration which in
those dark ages, when few could read, the designers of these buildings
seem to have considered as virtually of more importance than the
architectural work to which it was attached.Any attempt to judge of the
one without taking into consideration the other, would be forming an
opinion on hearing but half the evidence; but taken in conjunction, the
paintings go far to explain, and also to redeem, many points in which
the architecture is most open to criticism.During the whole period of the development of early Christian
architecture in Rome, the city of Ravenna, owing to her close connection
with the Eastern empire, almost rivalled in importance the old capital
of the world, and her churches were consequently hardly less important
either in number or in richness than those we have just been describing.It is true she had none so large as the great metropolitan basilicas of
St.The one five-aisled church she possessed—the
cathedral—has been entirely destroyed, to make way for a very
contemptible modern erection.From the plans, however, which we possess
of it, it seems to have differed very considerably from the Roman
examples, most especially in having no trace of a transept, the building
being a perfectly regular parallelogram, half as long again as its
breadth, and with merely one great apse added at the end of the central
nave.Its loss is the more to be regretted, as it was, besides being the
largest, the oldest church in the city, having been erected about the
year 400, by Archbishop Ursus.The baptistery that belonged to it has
been fortunately preserved, and will be described hereafter.Besides a considerable number of other churches which have either been
lost or destroyed by repair, Ravenna still possesses two first-class
three-aisled basilicas—the San Apollinare Nuovo,[272] originally an
Arian church, built by Theodoric, king of the Goths (A.D.493-525); and
the S. Apollinare in Classe, at the Port of Ravenna, situated about
three miles from the city, commenced A.D.538, and dedicated 549 A.D.Of
the two, the first-named is by far the more considerable, being 315 ft.long by 115 in width externally, while the other only measures 216 ft.As will be seen by the plan, S. Apollinare in Classe
is a perfectly regular basilica with twelve pillars on each side of the
nave, which is 50 ft.The apse is raised to allow of a crypt
underneath, and externally it is polygonal, like the Byzantine apse.Arches in Church of San Apollinare Nuovo.[273])]

The great merit of these two basilicas, as compared with those of Rome,
arises from the circumstance of Ravenna having possessed no ruined
temples whose spoils could be used in the construction of new buildings.On the other hand the Goths had no architectural forms of their own; the
architects and workmen therefore who were brought over from
Constantinople reproduced the style with which they were best acquainted
in the East, with such alterations in plan as the liturgies of the
church required, such modifications in construction as the materials of
the country necessitated, and such ideas in architectural design as were
suggested by the examples in Rome with which Theodoric was well
acquainted, having not only restored some of the churches there, but
insisted that the primitive style should be adhered to.The simple
basilican form of church with nave, and aisles without galleries over,
and a single apse, was based on numerous examples existing in Rome, to
which source may be ascribed the external blind arcades of the aisle and
nave walls.[274] From Woodcut 410, representing the arches of the nave
of St.Apollinare Nuovo, it will be seen that an elegance of proportion
is revealed and a beauty of design shown in the details of the
capitals[275] and the dosserets which surmount them, which are quite
foreign to any Roman examples.The great triforium frieze above the
arches, and the wall space above them between the clerestory windows,
covered with mosaics, executed 570 A.D.by Greek artists from
Constantinople, suggest a completeness of design which had not been
reached in Rome.All this is still more apparent in Woodcut No.411,
taken from the arcade where the nave joins the apse in St.Apollinare in
Classe, which shows a further advance in the working out of a new style,
based partially on Roman work, but carried out by Byzantine artists.Part of Apse in S. Apollinare in Classe, Ravenna.S. Apollinare in Classe, Ravenna.Externally these buildings appear to have remained to the present hour
almost wholly without architectural embellishment.It was considered
sufficient for ornamental purposes to make the brick arches necessary
for the construction slightly more prominent and important than was
actually required.As if impelled by some feeling of antagonism to the
practice of the heathens, the early Christians seem to have tried to
make the external appearance of their buildings as unlike those of their
predecessors as was possible.Whether this was the cause or not, it is
certain that nothing can well be less ornamental than these exteriors;
and even the _narthex_,[276] which in the Apollinare in Classe afforded
an excellent opportunity for embellishment, could not be less ornamental
if it were the entrance to a barn instead of to a church of such
richness and beauty as this in all its internal arrangements.The restoration of portions of the Cathedral of St.Mark during the past
twenty years, and the careful examination of various documents in the
archives of that city have led to the discovery that the work attributed
to Doge Pietro Orseolo, 976-78, consisted mainly in the re-construction
of the basilican church erected by the Doge Jean Participazio in 829-32,
and burnt in 976.Mark the
Evangelist, brought from Alexandria in 828 (when the Mohametans pulled
down the church of St.Mark in that town), determined Jean’s brother
Justinian to build a church which should be worthy of their reception.He died, however, before the work was commenced, but left a large sum of
money for the purpose.This church was built on the old site situated
between the Ducal Palace and the church of St.Theodore, which, up to
that time, had served as the Ducal chapel.The width of the church would
seem to have been the same as that of the present nave and aisles.Its
west end formed part of the existing wall behind the present vestibule,
but some difference of opinion seems to exist as to its eastern end, and
whether it coincided with the actual apses.Though nominally built in
976-78 the decoration of Orseolo’s church was probably carried on in
succeeding years, and much of the sculptural work in the present
building dates from the first half of the 11th century.In 1063, under
the Doge Domenico Contarini, the church of St.Theodore, according to M.
Cattaneo,[277] was pulled down and some of its materials used in the new
cathedral.Portions also of the Ducal Palace were destroyed to give
increased space on the south side for the Transept, the portion known as
the Treasury only being preserved.[278] The record of the new church
states that it was built similar in its artistic construction to that at
Constantinople erected in honour of the twelve apostles.[279] The
arrangement and the design of the church thus extended were probably due
to a Greek architect, though much of the work, according to M. Cattaneo,
was afterwards carried out by a Lombard sculptor, Mazulo, who designed
the atrium and tower of the abbey of Pomposa (about 30 miles from
Venice), where the carving is of the same character or style as that in
St.across the transepts; externally these dimensions are increased
to 260 × 215, and the whole area to about 46,000 square ft., so that
although of respectable dimensions it is by no means a large church.The
central and western dome are 42 ft.They are carried on spherical pendentives resting on circular
barrel vaults about 15 ft.extends under
the eastern dome and apses, the vault being supported by fifty-six
monolithic columns 5 ft.high: the whole height from floor to the
crown of the arch being under 9 ft.The construction of this crypt
probably followed the erection of the church, which was not consecrated
till 1111, when Ordelapo Faliero was Doge.Externally this apse is
polygonal, as in Byzantine churches, the upper storey being set back to
allow of a passage round.The narthex or vestibule in front of the
church, which extends also on north and south of the nave aisles up to
the transepts, and the rooms over the north narthex and over part of the
baptistery, must have followed the erection of the church; in fact, the
principal front could not have been completed without them.(From ‘Chiesi
Principali di Europa.’)]

Externally the original construction was in brick, with blind arcades,
niches, and a simple brick cornice such as is found in Lombardic work.It was not till the commencement of the 13th century that the decoration
of the front and sides with marble was undertaken; the arches were
encased with marble slabs carried on ranges of columns, those of the
narthex being placed one above the other.The shafts, capitals and bases
were brought from other buildings, having been imported from Altinum,
Aquileia, Heraclea, Ravenna, and from other places in Dalmatia, Syria,
and the East.It is possible that the porches of the churches of St.Trophime at Arles may have suggested this method of
decoration, of which no prototype exists in the East.The capitals are
of all periods, from the 4th to the 11th centuries, the entablature
blocks and the stylobates being specially worked for the building.The
rose window of the south transept and others of similar style were
inserted about the commencement of the 14th century, the baptistery and
the chapel of St.Isidore[280] being encased with marbles in the middle
of the same century, and the decoration of the upper part of the arches
of the west, towards the end of the 14th century.As will be seen by the
north and south fronts section (Woodcut No.416) the original brick
domes were surmounted by timber domes covered with lead, and of
considerable height.These were probably added in the middle of the 13th
century.[281] The rood loft dates from the end of the same century.The
earlier mosaics in the domes date from the 12th century, and the marble
casing of the lower portion of the walls and the richly decorated
pavement from the 12th and 13th centuries.The work of decoration was
carried on through succeeding centuries with occasional restorations, so
that the church itself constitutes a museum with almost every phase of
work in mosaic from the 12th to the 18th centuries.Though from a strictly architectural point of view the disposition of
the design is not equal to those of some of our northern cathedrals
(except perhaps for the greater beauty of Byzantine domical
construction), it is impossible to find fault with plain surfaces when
they are covered with such exquisite gold mosaics as those of St.Mark’s, or with the want of accentuation in the lines of the roof, when
every part of it is more richly adorned in this manner than any other
church of the Western world.Then too the rood screens, the pulpit, the
pala d’oro and the whole furniture of the choir are so rich, so
venerable, and on the whole so beautiful, and seen in so exquisitely
subdued a light, that it is impossible to deny that it is perhaps the
most impressive interior in Western Europe.Front at Périgueux, with
almost identical dimensions and design (Woodcut No.562), is cold,
scattered, and unmeaning, because but a structural skeleton of St.Mark’s without its adornments.The interior of a 13th-century Gothic
church is beautiful, even when whitewashed; but these early attempts had
not yet reached that balance between construction and ornament, which is
necessary to real architectural effect.The same is true of the exterior; if stripped of its ornament and
erected in plain stone it would hardly be tolerable, and the mixture of
florid 14th-century foliage and bad Italian Gothic details with the
older work, would be all but unendurable.But marble, mosaic, sculpture,
and the all-hallowing touch of age and association, disarm the critic,
and force him to worship when his reason tells him he ought to blame.Mark’s must have been admired in the days of its freshness,
the Gothic feeling seems to have been so strong in Northern Italy in the
11th and 12th centuries as to prevent its being used as a model.The one
prominent exception is San Antonio, Padua (1237-1307), which is
evidently a copy of St.Mark’s, but with so much Gothic design mixed up
with it as to spoil both.Length was sought to be obtained by using
seven domes instead of five, and running an aisle round the apse.The
side-aisles were covered with intersecting vaults, and pointed arches
were occasionally introduced when circular would have harmonised better
with the general design.Externally the enveloping porch was omitted—not even the Pisan
modification of it introduced, though it might have been employed with
the happiest effect.The consequence of all this jumble is, that San
Antonio is externally one of the most unsatisfactory churches in Europe,
though possessing a quaint Oriental look from the grouping of its dome
with the minaret-like spires which adorn it.The inside is not so bad,
though a roof of only five bays over a quasi-Gothic church, 200 ft.in
length, distorts the proportion, and with the ill-understood details of
the whole, spoils what narrowly escaped being one of the most successful
interiors of that part of Italy.Both Dalmatia and Istria formed part of the Gothic kingdom of Theodoric:
we find therefore the same Byzantine influence exerted as in Ravenna; an
influence which increased when the first-named country was retaken by
Justinian in 535, and the second in 539 A.D.At Parenzo in Istria there is a basilica, built in the year 543 A.D.by
the Bishop Euphrasius, and consequently contemporary with the examples
at Ravenna already described.This church still retains its atrium,
baptistery, and other accompaniments, which those at Ravenna have lost.It consists of a basilica in three aisles, with an apse at the end of
each, and an atrium in front, beyond which is situated the baptistery;
and in front of this again a tower, though this latter feature seems to
be of more modern date.On one side at the east end is a chapel or
crypt; this, Mr.Jackson[282] suggests, may have been “the martyrium or
confessio of the basilica where the remains of the saintly patrons of
the church were preserved and venerated.” “According to strict rule,”
Mr.Jackson observes, “the confessio should be in a crypt under the
choir as at Aquileja and Zara, but Parenzo lies so low that excavation
would be difficult, and here as in other cases the martyrium may have
been placed in an adjoining building.”[283]

Internally the church is 121 ft.in length by 32 in width, and possesses
all the usual arrangements of a church of that date.The columns are
borrowed from some earlier edifice, but the capitals are all original,
and were carved for the church.They are all of pure Byzantine type, and
are surmounted by that essentially Byzantine feature the dosseret.The
central apse, though circular inside, is polygonal outside, which is
another characteristic of Byzantine work.Like Torcello it has still
preserved its semicircle of marble seats for the clergy, with the
episcopal throne in the middle.Externally the façade retains portions
of the ancient mosaics with which it was decorated, and although
internally the nave has lost its early decorations, the lofty dado of
the apse inlaid with slabs of porphyry and serpentine interspersed with
mosaics of opaque glass, onyx and mother-of-pearl, bears witness to its
original splendour, the cypher of Euphrasius denoting its execution to
be coeval with the building of the church, and therefore some centuries
earlier than the mosaics of the baldachino, which are dated 1277.Church at Parenzo in Istria.Jackson for the description of two churches
at Grado: the Duomo and St.Maria delle Grazie; the former a fine
basilican church with nave and aisles and a deep central apse, circular
inside and polygonal externally.[284] The twenty columns of the nave are
all taken from earlier edifices, and of the capitals which surmount them
five are Roman and twelve of pure Byzantine workmanship, based on the
Roman composite capital, but treated in a quite original way.The
capitals are not surmounted by the dosseret, but in the other church of
St.Maria delle Grazie some have the dosseret and others are without it,
though all of the same period.The chief glory of the church, however,
lies in its magnificent marble pavement (measured and illustrated in Mr.Jackson’s work), the greater portion of which is still preserved.Maria delle Grazie is a small basilican church of six bays
with fragments of similar pavement to those in the Duomo.The apse here
is masked on the exterior by two sacristies on each side which entirely
enclose it; similar examples are found in De Vogüé’s work of “Central
Syria” (Woodcuts Nos.The churches of Parenzo and Grado appear to be the only examples
remaining of early Romano-Byzantine work on this side of the Adriatic.Maria de Canneto at Pola, consecrated in 546 A.D., was destroyed in
the 14th and 15th centuries and its materials carried off to Venice for
the adornment of the churches there.As edifices of the age of
Justinian, and as showing the relative position of the various parts
that made up an ecclesiastical establishment in those early times, the
churches of Parenzo and Grado are singularly deserving of the attention
of those to whom the history of art is a matter of interest.The church at Torcello, in the Venetian Lagune, is the last example it
will be necessary to quote in order to make the arrangements of the
early basilicas intelligible.It was originally erected in the seventh
century; of this church, according to M. Cattaneo, the only portion
remaining, if we except a fragment of the ancient baptistery, is the
central apse.In 864, the church would seem to have been reconstructed,
and to this period belong the two side apses, the apsidal crypt with new
windows pierced through the old wall and the external walls: it is
possible that the original nave of the seventh century was retained till
1008, when it was rebuilt by the Doge Pietro Orseolo, on the occasion of
his son being raised to the Bishopric of Torcello.Thirteen of the
capitals of the nave date from this period, one may be earlier, and five
belong to the second half of the 12th century.The whole width of the
church is 71 ft.A screen of six pillars
divides the nave from the sanctuary.Perhaps, however, the most
interesting part of this church is the interior of its apse, which still
retains the bishop’s throne, surrounded by six ranges of seats for his
presbytery, arranged like those of an ancient theatre.It presents one
of the most extensive and best preserved examples of the fittings of the
apse, and gives a better idea of the mode in which the apses of churches
were originally arranged than anything that is to be found in any other
church, either of its age or of an earlier period.404), this church possesses a small
side chapel, a vestry or sanctuary, on the Gospel side of the altar, and
the remains of the ancient baptistery may still be traced in front of
the west door.This was a square block, externally, measuring 37 ft.each way; internally an octagon, with the angles cut into hemispherical
niches.A portion of its eastern side only remains, and this is now
hidden behind the modern baptistery, in which, under a board in the
pavement, can be seen the foundations of the second baptistery of the
12th century.In the rear of the church stood the campanile, and across
a narrow passage the conventual buildings; in front of which now stands
the beautiful little church of Sta.Fosca, the whole making up a group
of nearly unrivalled interest considering its small dimensions.Other examples might be quoted differing in some slight respect from
those just given, but the above are probably sufficient to explain the
general arrangements of the early basilican churches and the style of
their architecture, so long as this worked on the old tradition of the
Romano-Byzantine style; in other words, so long as it continued in Italy
to be a distinction from the Roman style without any foreign admixture
beyond that introduced direct from Byzantium.It might be instructive to
speculate on what the style might have become if left alone to develope
itself on its native soil, but it would be extremely difficult to make
the subject clear without a much larger amount of illustration than is
admissible, and which in such a history as this would be out of place.Simultaneously with the elaboration of the rectangular form of church by
the Italians, the Byzantines were occupied with the same task; but,
being freer from the trammels of tradition and less influenced by
examples, they early arrived at forms much more divergent from those of
the classical period than those of Italy, and their style, reacting on
the Italian, produced that very beautiful combination of which Pisa
Cathedral is a type, and St.Mark’s at Venice an extreme example.This
style generally pervaded the whole south of Italy, with the exception of
Rome; and, from the elements of which it was composed, may fairly be
designated Byzantine Italian.Apse of Basilica at Torcello.]While this was going on in the south, the Longobards, and other
Barbarians who invaded the north of Italy, seized on this type and
worked it out in their own fashion.They, however, conceived the desire
to give a more permanent character to their churches by covering them
over with stone vaulted roofs, which led to most important modifications
of the style.It may probably be correct to assert that no
Romano-Byzantine or early Romanesque church has, or ever had, a vaulted
nave.On the other hand, there is hardly a Barbarian church which the
builders did not aspire to vault, though they were frequently unable to
accomplish it.It was this vaulting mania which led to the invention of
compound piers, pointed arches, buttresses, pinnacles, and all the
numerous peculiarities of the Gothic style; and which, reacting on
northern Italy, produced the Ghibelline or Italian-Gothic style.No exact boundary can be drawn between these two: modifications of style
varied, as Byzantine or Gothic influences ebbed or flowed, during the
Middle Ages.Venice and Pisa, and all Calabria, were generally
influenced by their intercourse with the East, while the whole of the
north of Italy and away from the coast as far down as Sienna and Orvieto
the strong hand of the Teuton made itself felt.Yet Italy cannot be said to have been successful in either style.Her
superior civilisation enabled her to introduce and use an elegance of
detail unknown north of the Alps; but she did not work out the basilican
type for herself: she left it to others to do that for her, and
consequently never perfectly understood what she undertook, or why it
was done.The result is that, though great elegance is found in parts,
Italy can hardly produce a single church which is satisfactory as a
design; or which would be intelligible without first explaining the
basework of those true styles from which its principal features have
been borrowed.Costanza—Churches at Perugia, Nocera,
  Ravenna, Milan—Secular Buildings.In addition to the Pagan basilicas and temples, from which the
arrangements of so many of the Christian edifices were obtained, the
tombs of the Romans formed a third type, from which the forms of a very
important class of churches were derived.The form which these buildings retained, so long as they remained mere
sepulchres appropriated to Pagan uses, has been already described (pp.That of Cæcilia Metella and those of Augustus and Hadrian
were what would now be called “chambered tumuli;” originally the
sepulchral chamber was infinitesimally small as compared with the mass,
but we find these being gradually enlarged till we approach the age of
Constantine, when, as in the tombs of the Tossia Family, that called the
Tomb of Helena (Woodcut No.227) and many others of the same age, they
became miniature Pantheons.The central apartment was all in all; the
exterior was not thought of.Still they were appropriated to sepulchral
rites, and these only, so long as they belonged to Pagan Rome.The case
was different when they were erected by the Christians.No association
could be more appropriate than that of these sepulchral edifices, to a
religion nursed in persecution, and the apostles of which had sealed
their faith with their blood as martyrs; and when the Sacrament for the
dying and the burial service were employed, it was in these circular
churches that it was performed.But besides the viaticum for the
departing Christian, the Church provided the admission sacrament of
baptism for those who were entering into communion, and this was, in
early days at least, always performed in a building separate from the
basilica.It would depend on whether marriage was then considered as a
sacrament or a civil contract, whether it was celebrated in the basilica
or the church; but it seems certain that the one was used almost
exclusively as the business place of the community, the other as the
sacramental temple of the sect.This appears always to have been the
case, at least when the two forms existed together, as they almost
always did in the great ecclesiastical establishments of Italy.When the
church was copied from a temple, as in the African examples above
described, it is probable it may have served both purposes.But too
little is known of the architecture of this early age, and its
liturgies, to speak positively on the subject.The uses and derivation of these three forms of churches are so distinct
that it would be extremely convenient if we could appropriate names to
distinguish them.The first retains most appropriately the name of
basilica, and with sufficient limitation to make it generally
applicable.The word _ecclesia_, or _église_, would equally suffice for
the second but that it is not English, and has been so indiscriminately
applied that it could not now be used in a restricted sense.The word
kirk, or as we soften it into church, would be appropriate to the
third,[286] but again it has been so employed as to be inapplicable.We
therefore content ourselves with employing the words Basilica, Church,
and Round Church, to designate the three, employing some expletive when
any confusion is likely to arise between the first two of the series.The most interesting feature of the early Romanesque circular buildings
is that they show the same transitional progress from an external to an
internal columnar style of architecture which marked the change from the
Pagan to the Christian form of sacred edifice.It is perhaps not too
much to assert that no ancient classic building of circular form has any
pillars used constructively in its interior.[287] Even the Pantheon,
though 143 ft.in diameter, derives no assistance from the pillars
that surround it internally—they are mere decorative features.The same
is true of the last Pagan example we are acquainted with—the temple or
tomb which Diocletian erected in his palace at Spalato (Woodcut No.The pillars do fill up the angles there, but the building would be
stable without them.The Byzantine architects also generally declined to
avail themselves of pillars to support their domes, but the Romanesque
architects used them almost as universally as in their basilicas.Another very striking peculiarity is the entire abandonment of all
external decoration.Roman circular temples had peristyles, like those
at Tivoli (Woodcut No.193) and that of Vesta in Rome.Even the Pantheon
is as remarkable for its portico as its dome, so is that known as the
Torre dei Schiavi,[288] but it is only in the very earliest of the
Christian edifices that we find a trace of the portico, and even in them
hardly any attempt at external decoration.The temples of the Christians
were no longer shrines to contain statues and to which worship might be
addressed by people outside, but had become halls to contain the
worshippers themselves while engaged in acts of devotion.The tomb of the Empress Helena (Woodcut No.227) is one of the earliest
examples of its class.It has no pillars internally, it is true, but it
likewise has none on the exterior—the transition was not then complete.The same is the case with the two tombs on the Spina of the Circus of
Nero (Woodcut No.They too were astylar, and their external
appearance was utterly neglected.When from these we turn to the Tomb or Baptistery of Constantine, built
some time afterwards (Woodcut No.422), we find the roof supported by a
screen of eight columns, two storeys in height, and through all its
alterations can detect the effort to make the interior ornamental.It
has, however, a portico, but this again is practically an interior, both
ends being closed with apsidal terminations, so that it really forms a
second apartment, rather than a portico.In both these respects it is in
advance of the building next to it in age that we know of—the Octagon at
Spalato—which it otherwise very much resembles.The eight internal
pillars instead of being mere ornaments have become essential parts of
the construction, and the external peristyle has disappeared, leaving
only the fragment of a porch.(From
Isabelle, ‘Édifices Circulaires.’) Scale 100 ft.The tomb which the same Emperor erected to contain the remains of his
daughter Constantia, is another example of the same transitional style.The interior in this instance is vaulted, but so timidly that
twenty-four pillars are employed to sustain a weight for which half that
number would have been amply sufficient.In the square niche opposite
the entrance stood the sarcophagus of the princess, now in the Vatican.The roof of the aisle is adorned with paintings of the vintage and
scenes of rural life, which, like all those on the tombs of Pagan Rome,
have no reference to the sepulchral uses to which the building was
dedicated.The whole internal diameter of the tomb is 73 ft., that of
the dome 35.In front of the building is a small crypto-porticus similar in
arrangement to that of her father’s tomb, and beyond this is an oblong
space with circular ends, and surrounded on all sides by arcades; its
dimensions were 535 ft.by 130, and, though so ruined as hardly to allow
of its arrangements being restored, it is interesting as being perhaps
the only instance of the “_forum_,” which it is probable was left before
all tombs in those times, and traces of which may perhaps be found
elsewhere, though as yet they have not been looked for.(From Gutensohn and
Knapp.)The only other important circular building within the walls of Rome of
this early age is that known as S. Stefano Rotondo.Though there is
nothing to fix its date with any precision, it is almost certain that it
belongs to the fifth century of the Christian era.in
diameter, and its roof was supported by two ranges of columns,
circularly disposed in its interior; and on the first or inner range
rested a horizontal architrave like that of St.In the outer
one the pillars support arches like those of St.[290] All the
pillars are taken from older buildings.The outer aisle was divided into
eight compartments; but in what manner, and for what purpose, it is not
now easy to ascertain, owing to the ruined state of the building, and to
its having been so much and so frequently altered since it was first
erected.Nor can it be determined exactly how it was roofed; though it
is probable that its arrangements were identical with those of the great
five-aisled basilicas, which it closely resembles, except in its
circular shape.This is more clear in another church of the same age, that of Sti.Angeli, at Perugia, which is very similar in its disposition.Of this
building a section is here shown, as given by M. Isabelle—perhaps not
quite to be depended upon in every respect, but still affording a very
fair representation of what the arrangements of the circular wooden
roofed churches were.Its dimensions are much less than those of San
Stefano, being only 115 ft.in diameter; but it is more regular, the
greater part of its materials being apparently original, and made for
the place they occupy.In the church of San Stefano, the tomb-shaped
circular form was probably used as symbolical of his martyrdom.That at
Perugia was most likely originally a baptistery, or it may also have
been dedicated to some martyr; but in the heart of Etruria this form may
have been adopted for other reasons, the force of which we are hardly
able at the present day to appreciate, though in all cases locality is
one of the strongest influencing powers in so far as architectural forms
are concerned.(From Isabelle,
‘Édifices Circulaires.’) No scale.]Plan of Baptistery at Nocera dei Pagani.Double the
usual scale, or 50 ft.At Nocera dei Pagani, on the road between Naples and Salerno, there is
an extremely beautiful circular church, built undoubtedly for the
purpose of a baptistery, and very similar in plan and general
arrangement to the tomb of Constantia, now known as the Baptistery of
Sta.Agnese, though somewhat larger being 80 ft.Its
principal merit is the form of its dome, which is not only correct in a
scientific point of view, but singularly graceful internally.Externally
this building for the first time introduces us to a peculiarity which
had as much influence on the western styles as any of those pointed out
above.540), the early Romanesque architects
never attempted to vault their rectangular buildings, but they did
frequently construct domes over their circular edifices.But here again
they did not make the outside of the dome the outline of their
buildings, as the Romans had always done before the time of Constantine,
and as the Byzantines and Saracens invariably did afterwards; but they
employed their vault only as a ceiling internally, and covered it, as in
this instance, with a false wooden roof externally.It may be difficult
to determine how far this was a judicious innovation; but this at least
is certain, that it had as much influence on the development of the
Gothic style as the vaulting mania itself.In the 10th and 11th
centuries many attempts were made to construct true roofs of stone, but
unsuccessfully; and from various causes, which will be pointed out
hereafter, the idea was abandoned, and the architects were forced to
content themselves with a stone ceiling, covered by a wooden roof,
though this became one of the radical defects of the style, and one of
the principal causes of the decay and destruction of so many beautiful
buildings.Section of Baptistery at Nocera dei Pagani.(From
Isabelle, ‘Édifices Circulaires.’) No scale.]Ravenna possesses several circular buildings, almost as interesting as
those of the capital; the first being the baptistery of St.John
belonging to the original basilica, and consequently one of the oldest
Christian buildings of the place.Externally it is a plain octagonal
building, 40 ft.Internally it still retains its mosaic and
other internal features added in the 5th century, which are singularly
elegant and pleasing.Its design is somewhat like that of the temple at
Spalato, but with arcades substituted everywhere for horizontal
architraves; the century that elapsed between these two epochs having
sufficed to complete the transition between the two styles.Far more interesting than this is the great church of St.Vitale, the
most complicated, and at the same time, perhaps, the most beautiful, of
the circular churches of that age.In design it is nearly identical with
the church of St.Sergius at Constantinople (see Woodcut No.311), from
which it was undoubtedly copied, and probably by Greek artists from that
town.It was built in the reign of Justinian by St.Ecclesius,
archbishop of the see, and was consecrated in 547, eight years after the
taking of Ravenna by Justinian’s generals.The principal difference of
the plan lies in its being enclosed within an octagon instead of a
square, as in St.Sergius, probably to mask the irregularity of the main
entrance from a street which did not run in the direction of any of the
cardinal points.The recesses are loftier in proportion than those of
St.Sergius, and in the lower storey arcades take the place of beams.The aisles being covered with timber roofs, it was necessary to raise
the walls of the octagon higher than those of St.Sergius, and small
arches take the place of the usual pendentives: the springing of the
dome, which is 50 ft.in diameter, is on the level of the sill of the
windows the arches of which therefore form penetrations into the dome.The church is built in bricks with thick mortar joints, the dome being
constructed in an ingenious manner with hollow pots fitted the end of
one into the mouth of the other; the lightness of this vault has enabled
the builders to dispense with the immense arches and buttresses found in
St.Similar construction with pots had been
employed in the East for domes and roofs,[291] and they form as
permanent a method as stone itself, in addition to the stability,
facility of construction, and lightness which such an expedient affords.Internally a good deal has been done in modern times to destroy the
simplicity of the original effect of the building; but still there is a
pleasing result produced by alternating the piers with circular columns,
and a lightness and elegance about the whole design that render it
unrivalled in the western world among churches of its class.This seems
to have been admitted by its contemporaries as much as it is in modern
times.Charlemagne at all events copied it for his own tomb at
Aix-la-Chapelle, and the architects of many other circular buildings of
that age appear to have derived their inspiration from this one.The church of San Lorenzo at Milan, had it not been so much altered in
modern times, would take precedence of San Vitale in almost every
respect.The date of its erection is not known, though it certainly must
be as early as, if not earlier than, the time of Justinian.Down to the
8th century it was the cathedral of the city.It was burnt to the ground
in 1071, and restored in 1119; the dome then erected fell in 1571, on
which it underwent its last transformation from the hands of Martino
Bassi and Pellegrini, who so disfigured its ancient details as to lead
many modern inquirers to doubt whether it was really so old as it was
said to be.Its plan, however, seems to have remained unchanged, and shows a further
progress towards what afterwards became the Byzantine style than is to
be found either in St.It is in fact the
earliest attempt to amalgamate the circular church with one of a square
shape; and except that the four lateral colonnades are flat segments of
circles, and that there is a little clumsiness in the angles (due
possibly to the additions made in 1119 and 1571, when the plan of the
dome was changed to an octagon, the original dome being probably
circular, and carried on four spherical pendentives), it is one of the
most successful designs handed down from that early age.The dome as it now stands is octagonal, which the first dome certainly
could not have been.Its diameter is 70 ft., nearly equal to that of the
Minerva Medica, and the whole diameter of the building is internally 142
ft.(From Quast,
‘Altchristlichen,’ &c.)In front of the church, in the street, is a handsome colonnade of
pillars, borrowed from some ancient temple—it is said from one dedicated
to Hercules; this leads to a square atrium, now wholly deprived of its
lateral arcades; and this again to a façade, which has been strangely
altered in modern times.Opposite this, to the eastward of the church,
is an octagonal building, apparently intended as a tomb-house; and on
the north side a similar one, though smaller.On the south is the
baptistery, about 45 ft.in diameter, approached by a vestibule in the
same manner as that of Constantine at Rome, and as in the tomb of his
daughter Constantia: all these, however, have been so painfully altered,
that little remains besides the bare plan of the building; still there
is enough to show that this is one of the oldest and most interesting of
the Christian churches of Italy.The building now known as the baptistery at Florence is an octagon, 108
ft.Like the last-mentioned church, it was
originally the cathedral of the city, and was erected to serve as such
apparently in the time of Theodelinda, queen of the Lombards.If this
was so, it certainly had not originally its present form, and most
probably those columns which now stand ranged round the walls at that
time stood in the centre, as in the Roman examples.If the original roof
was of wood, it was probably in two storeys, like that of the baptistery
of Constantine, or it may have been a dome of more solid materials, like
that of the Sta.At the same time when the new cathedral was built, the older edifice
appears to have been remodelled both internally and externally by
Arnolpho da Lapo, and both its form and decoration so completely
changed, that it must now be considered rather as a building of the 13th
century than of the 6th, in which it seems originally to have been
erected.[292]

[Illustration: 433.Half Section, half Elevation, of the Baptistery at
Novara.The baptistery of Novara, which may date from the time of Charlemagne,
is interesting in that it contains the germ of those external galleries
under the roof which form not only one of the most common but also one
of the most beautiful features of the later Lombard and Rhenish
churches.433) it will easily be seen
what was the motive and use of this arrangement, the first trace of
which dates perhaps as far back as the baptistery of Nocera (Woodcut No.428); for wherever a wooden roof was placed over a circular vault, it is
evident that the external walls must be carried up higher than the
springing of the arch.But it was by no means necessary that this
additional wall should be so solid as that below it, and it was
necessary to introduce light and air into the space between the stone
and the wooden roofs.Add to this the incongruity of effect in placing a
light tiled wooden roof on a massive solid wall, and it will be evident
that not only did the exigencies of the building, but the true
principles of taste, demand that this part should be made as light as
possible.Such openings as those found in the baptistery at Novara
suggested an expedient which provided for these objects.This was
afterwards carried to a much greater extent.At first, however, it seems
only to have been used under the roofs of the domes with which the
Italians almost universally crowned the intervention of naves and
transepts, and round the semidomes of the apses; but so enamoured did
they afterwards become of this feature, that it is frequently carried
along the sides of the churches under the roof of the nave and of the
aisles, and also—where it is of more questionable taste—under the
sloping naves of the roof of the principal façade.There is nothing in the Lombardian and Rhenish styles so common or so
beautiful as these galleries, the arcades of which have all the shadow
given by a cornice without its inconvenient projection, while the little
shafts with their elegant capitals and light archivolts have a sparkle
and brilliancy which no cornice ever possessed.Indeed so beautiful are
they, that we are not surprised to find them universally adopted; and
their discontinuance on the introduction of the pointed style was one of
the greatest losses sustained by architectural art in those days.It is
true they would have been quite incompatible with the thin walls and
light piers of pointed architecture, but it may be safely asserted that
no feature which these new styles introduced was equally beautiful with
those galleries which they superseded.Tomb of Galla Placidia, Ravenna.There can be little doubt that many other similar buildings belonging to
this age still exist in various parts of Italy; for it is more than
probable that, at a time when the city was not of sufficient importance,
or the congregation so numerous as to require the more extended
accommodation of the basilica, almost all the earlier churches were
circular.They either, however, have perished from lapse of time, or
have been so altered as to be nearly unrecognisable.We here, in
consequence, come again to a break in the chain of our sequence; and
when we again meet with any circular buildings in Italy, their features
are so distinctly Gothic or Byzantine, that they must be classed with
one or other of these modifications.The true Romano-Byzantine style had
nearly come to an end when Alboin the Lombard had made himself master of
the greater part of Italy about the year 575.Before leaving this branch of the subject there are two small buildings
at Ravenna which it is impossible to pass over, though their direct
bearing on the history of this subject is not so apparent as it is in
the case of other buildings just described.The first and earliest is
the tomb of Galla Placidia (Woodcut No.302), now known as the church of
SS.Nazario and Celso, and must have been erected before the year 450.It is singular among all the tombs of that age from the abandonment in
it of the circular for a cruciform plan.Such forms, it is true, are
common in the chambers of tumuli and also among the catacombs, while the
church which Constantine built in Constantinople and dedicated to the
Apostles, meaning it however as a sepulchral church, was something also
on this plan.Notwithstanding, however, these examples, this must be
considered as an exceptional form, though its diminutiveness (it being
only 35 ft.by 30 internally) might perhaps account for any caprice.Its
great interest to us consists in its retaining not only its primitive
architectural form (which is that of a dome carried on pendentives, and
one of the few instances in which both dome and pendentives form part of
one sphere), but its polychromatic decorations nearly in their original
state of completeness (Woodcut 302).The three arms of the cross forming
the receptacles for the three sarcophagi is certainly a pleasing
arrangement, but is only practicable on a small scale.Capital of Pillars forming peristyle round
Theodoric’s Tomb.Elevation of Tomb of Theodoric, Ravenna.(From
Isabelle, ‘Édifices Circulaires.’)]

Far more interesting than this—architecturally at least—is the tomb of
Theodoric, the Gothic king, now known as Santa Maria Rotunda.The lower
storey is a decagon externally, enclosing a cruciform crypt.in diameter, each face being ornamented by a deep niche.These
support a flat terrace, on which originally stood a range of small
pillars supporting arches which surrounded the upper storey.These have
all been removed, though their form can be restored from fragments
found, and as shown in Woodcut No.On the face of the tomb itself
are the sinkings for the architraves and vaults which they supported.The most singular part of the building is the roof, which is formed of
one great slab hollowed out into the form of a flat dome—internally 30
ft.in diameter—and which certainly forms one of
the most unique and appropriate coverings for a tomb perhaps anywhere to
be found.Near the edge are a series of projecting bosses, which
evidently were originally used as handles, by means of which the immense
mass was raised to its present position.In the centre of the dome is a
small square pedestal, on which, it is said, once stood the urn which
contained the ashes of its founder.The model of this building seems probably to have been the Mole of
Hadrian, which Theodoric saw, and must have admired, during his
celebrated visit to Rome.The polygonal arrangements of the exterior,
and the substitution of arcades for horizontal architraves, were only
such changes as the lapse of time had rendered indispensable.But the
building of the ancient world which it most resembles is the Tour Magne
at Nîmes.In both cases we have the polygonal basement containing a
great chamber, and above this externally the narrow ledge, approached by
flying flights of steps.We cannot now tell what crowned the French
example, though the fact of an urn crowning the tomb at Ravenna points
to an identical origin, but we must obtain a greater number of examples
before we can draw any positive conclusions as to the origin of such
forms.Meanwhile, however, whether we consider the appropriateness of
the forms, the solidity of its construction, or the simplicity of its
ornaments and details, this tomb at Ravenna is not surpassed by any
building of its class and age.Though the investigation of the early history of these circular forms of
churches is not so important as that of the rectangular basilicas, it is
extremely interesting from the influence they had on the subsequent
development of the style.In Italy it is probable that one-half of the
early churches were circular in plan; and one such is still generally
retained attached to each cathedral as a baptistery.Except for this
purpose, however, the form has generally been superseded: the
rectangular being much easier to construct, more capable of extension,
and altogether more appropriate to the ritual of the Christian
community.In France the circular form was early absorbed into the
basilica, forming the Chevet or apse.In Germany its fate was much the
same as in Italy, but its supersession was earlier and more complete.In
England some half-dozen examples are known to exist, and in Spain they
have yet to be discovered.Had the Gothic architects applied themselves to the extension and
elaboration of the circular form with the same zeal and skill as was
displayed in that task by their Byzantine brethren, they might probably
have produced something far more beautiful than even the best of our
mediæval cathedrals; but when the Barbarians began to build, they found
the square form with its straight lines simpler and easier to construct.It thus happened that, long before they became as civilised and expert
as the Easterns were when they commenced the task, the Westerns had
worked the rectangular form into one of considerable beauty, and had
adapted it to their ritual, and their ritual to it.It thus became the
sacred and appropriate form, and the circular or domical forms were
consequently never allowed a fair trial in Western Europe.Very few remains of secular buildings in the early Christian style are
now to be found in Italy.The palace of Theodoric at Ravenna, though
sadly mutilated, is perhaps the best and most perfect.In all its
details it shows a close resemblance to that of Diocletian at Spalato,
but more especially so to the Porta Aurea and the most richly and least
classically decorated parts of that edifice, but much intermixed with
mouldings and details which would seem to belong to a later style.Another building, though perhaps of earlier date, is that which is now
called the Palazzo delle Torre at Turin, and which still retains the
architectural ordinance of the exterior of a Roman amphitheatre, but so
modified by common sense that the pilasters are frankly accepted as
purely decorative features, having only a slight projection.A similar
style of work is found at Bordeaux in what is known as the “Palais
Gallien,” but which in reality is a fragment of an amphitheatre built by
the Emperor Gallienus (260-268 A.D.).The example at Turin is built with
brick of large dimensions 15 in.by 11 in., which, coupled with its
character and style, has led M. Cattaneo to ascribe it to the 3rd or 4th
century of our era; the paucity of contemporary examples, however,
renders it extremely difficult to trace the exact history of the style
at this age.Palazzo delle Torre, Turin.(From Osten’s ‘Bauwerke
in der Lombardei.’)]

In so progressive an art as architecture it is always very difficult,
sometimes impossible, to fix the exact date when one style ends and
another begins.In an art so pre-eminently ecclesiastical as
architecture was in those days, it will probably be safer to look in the
annals of the Church rather than in those of the State for a date when
the debased-Roman expired, giving birth, phœnix-like, to the Romanesque.Viewed from this point there can be little doubt but that the reign of
Gregory the Great (A.D.590 to 603) must be regarded as that in which
the Latin language and the Roman style of architecture both ceased to be
generally or even commonly employed.After this date we wander on through five centuries of tentative efforts
to form a new style, and in the age of another Gregory—the VII.—we find
at last the Romanesque style emancipated from former traditions, and
marching steadily forward with a well-defined aim.What had been
commenced under the gentle influence of a Theodelinda at Florence in the
year 600, was completed in the year 1077 under the firmer guidance of a
Matilda at Canossa.LOMBARD AND ROUND-ARCHED GOTHIC.Chapel at Friuli—Churches at Piacenza and Novara—St.Ambrogio, Milan—Cathedral, Piacenza—Churches at Verona—Churches at
  Toscanella—Circular Churches—Towers.When, in the early centuries of the Christian era, the great mass of
Gothic barbarism moved up the Valley of the Danube towards the west, one
great division followed that river to its source, and thence penetrated
into and settled in the Valley of the Rhine.Though sufficiently
numerous to be able almost wholly to obliterate all traces of former
civilisation, they had virtually no style of their own, and it seems
probable that the edifices left by the Romans sufficed for the early
wants of the people.The other great division of the horde turned to the Sömmering Alps and,
penetrating into Italy by way of Udine and Conegliano, settled in the
Valley of the Po.They may have been as numerous as the others; but
Italy in those days was far more densely peopled than Germany, and the
inhabitants were consequently able to resist obliteration far more
successfully than on the north of the Alps, and even where the new
element prevailed most strongly its influence was far less felt than in
the more sparsely-peopled Rhenish provinces.This was generally more
apparent along the coast than in the interior.Venice did not exist, and
Ravenna, though overwhelmed, became the great centre of Romano-Byzantine
art.The
Barbarian influence was strongly felt at Siena, more feebly at Orvieto;
but there it was stopped by the influence of Rome, which throughout the
Middle Ages remained nearly uncontaminated.Notwithstanding the almost insuperable barrier of the Alps which
stretched between them and the different influences to which they were
subjected, the connection between the northern and southern hordes
remained intimate during the whole of the Middle Ages.Milan was as much
German as Italian; and, indeed, except from a slightly superior degree
of elegance in the southern examples, it is sometimes extremely
difficult to distinguish between the designs of Lombard and of Rhenish
churches.As the Middle Ages wore on, however, the breach between the
two styles widened; and there is no difficulty, in the later pointed
schools, in seeing how Italy was gradually working itself free from
German influence, till at last they became distinct and antagonistic
nationalities, practising two styles of art, which had very little in
common the one with the other.Whoever the Barbarians were who in the 5th and 6th centuries swarmed
into Italy—Austro-Goths, Visi-Goths, or Lombards—they certainly did not
belong to any of the great building races of the world.Few people ever
had better opportunities than they of employing their easily-acquired
plunder in architectural magnificence, if they had any taste that way;
but, though we hear everywhere of the foundation of churches and the
endowment of ecclesiastical establishments during the Carlovingian
period, not one important edifice of that age has come down to our time.The monumental history of the early Romanesque style is as essentially a
blank in Italy as it is in Saxon England.One or two circular buildings
remain tolerably entire; some small chapels let us into the secrets of
the style, but not one important edifice of any sort attests the
splendour of the Lombard kingdom of Northern Italy.Aryans they must
have been, and it was not till the beginning of the 11th century, when
their blood was thoroughly mixed with that of the indigenous inhabitants
and a complete fusion of races had taken place, that we find buildings
of a monumental character erected, which have come down to the present
day.Among the smaller monuments of the age none has been preserved more
complete and less altered than the little chapel at Friuli; which,
though extremely small (only 18 ft.by 30 inside the walls), is
interesting, as retaining all its decorations almost exactly as they
were left by Gertrude, duchess of Friuli, who erected it in the 8th
century.It shows considerable elegance in its details, and the
sculpture is far better than it afterwards became, though perhaps its
most remarkable peculiarity is the intersecting vault that covers
it—_pulchre testudinatum_, as the old chronicle terms it.This is one
proof among many, how early that feature was introduced which afterwards
became the formative principle of the whole Gothic style, and was as
essentially its characteristic as the pillars and entablatures of the
five orders were the characteristics of the classical styles of Greece
and Rome.As before remarked, it is this necessity for a stone roof that
was the problem to be solved by the architects, and to accomplish which
the style took almost all those forms which are so much admired in it.From this example of the Carlovingian era we are obliged to pass to the
11th and 12th centuries, the first great building age of the Lombards.It is true that there is scarcely a single important church in Pavia, in
Verona, or indeed in any of the cities of Lombardy, the original
foundation of which cannot be traced back to a much earlier period.Before the canons of architectural criticism were properly understood,
antiquaries were inclined to believe that in the buildings now existing
they saw the identical edifices erected during the period of the Lombard
sway.Either, however, in consequence of the rude construction of the
earlier buildings, or because they were too small or too poor for the
increased population and wealth of the cities at a later period, every
one of the original churches has disappeared and been replaced by a
larger and better-constructed edifice, adorned with all the improvements
which the experience of centuries had introduced into the construction
of religious edifices.Judging from the rudeness of the earliest churches which we know to have
been erected in the 11th century, it is evident that the progress made,
up to that period, was by no means equal to what was accomplished during
the next two centuries.[294]]

This will appear from the plan and section of St.Antonio at Piacenza
(Woodcuts Nos.440 and 440a), built in the first years of the 11th
century, and dedicated in 1014 by Bishop Siegfried.Section of Church of San Antonio at Piacenza.Plan and section of Baptistry at Asti.Its arrangement is somewhat peculiar; the transepts are near the west
end, and the octagonal tower rising from the intersection is supported
on eight pillars, the square being completed by four polygonal piers.The principal point, however, to observe is, how completely the style
has emancipated itself from all Roman tradition.A new style has grown
up as essentially different from the early Christian as the style of
Cologne or of York Cathedral.The architect is once more at liberty to
work out his own designs without reference to anything beyond the
exigencies of the edifices themselves.The plan, indeed, is still a
reminiscence of the Basilica; but so are all the plans of Mediæval
cathedrals, and we may trace back the forms of the pillars, the piers,
and the arches they support, to the preceding style.All these were
derived from Roman art, but the originals are forgotten, and the new
style is wholly independent of the old one.The whole of the church too
is roofed with intersecting vaults, which have become an integral part
of the design, giving it an essentially different character.On the
outside buttresses are introduced—timidly, it is true, but so
frequently, as to make it evident that already there existed no
insuperable objection to increase either their number or depth, as soon
as additional abutment was required for wider arches.The windows, as in all Italian churches, are small, for the Italians
never patronised the art of painting on glass, always preferring
frescoes or paintings on opaque grounds.In their bright climate, very
small openings alone were requisite to admit a sufficiency of light
without disturbing that shadowy effect which is so favourable to
architectural grandeur.Being a parochial church, this building had no baptistery attached to
it; but there is one at Asti (Woodcut No.441) so similar in style and
age, that its plan and section, if examined with those of San Antonio,
will give a very complete idea of Lombard architecture in the beginning
of the 11th century, when it had completely shaken off the Roman
influence, but had not yet begun to combine the newly-invented forms
with that grace and beauty which mark its more finished examples.One
peculiarity of this building is the gloom that reigns within, there
being absolutely no windows in the dome, and those in the aisles are so
small, that even in Italy the interior must always have been in
comparative darkness.The cathedral of Novara, which in its present state is one of the most
important buildings of the 11th century in the North of Italy, shows the
style still further advanced.The coupling and grouping of piers are
here fully understood, and the divisions of the chapels which form the
outer aisle are, in fact, concealed buttresses.The Italians were never
able to divest themselves of their partiality for flat walls, and never
liked the bold external projections so universally admired on the other
side of the Alps.They therefore gladly had recourse to this expedient
to conceal them; and when this was not available they used metallic ties
to resist the thrust of the arches—an expedient which is found even in
this example.As will be seen from the annexed plan, the atrium
connecting the basilica with the baptistery is retained, which seems to
have been an arrangement almost universal in those early times.The half
section, half elevation of the front (Woodcut No.443) shows very
distinctly how far the invention of the new style had then gone; for
except some Corinthian pillars, borrowed from an older edifice, no trace
of debased-Roman architecture is to be found in it.The design of the
façade explains what it was that suggested to the Pisan architects the
form to which they adapted their Romanesque details.In both styles the
arcade was the original model of the whole system of ornamentation.In
this case it is used first as a discharging arch, then as a mere
repetition of a useful member, and lastly without pillars, as a mere
ornamental string-course, which afterwards became the most favourite
ornament, not only in Italy, but throughout all Germany.Elevation and Section of the Façade of the Cathedral
at Novara.Interesting as such an example is to the architectural antiquary who is
tracing back and trying to understand the forms of a new style, it would
be difficult to conceive anything much uglier and less artistic than
such a façade as this of Novara or that of San Antonio, last quoted.Their sole merit is their history and their expression of rude energy,
so characteristic of the people who erected them.The church of San Michele at Pavia, which took its present form either
at the end of the 11th or beginning of the 12th century, is one of the
most interesting of this age, and presents in itself all the
characteristics of a perfect round-arched Gothic church.Indeed there is
hardly any feature worth mentioning which was invented after this date
except the pointed arch—a very doubtful improvement—and window tracery,
which the Italians never cordially adopted or understood.444) shows the general arrangement of San Michele in its
present state.The researches of M. de Dartein,[295] however, have shown
that, when first built, the nave was covered over with two square
quadripartite vaults, as might in fact have been divined from the
difference in size[296] of the centre and two other piers.The existing
oblong vaulted compartments date from the 15th century, when secondary
shafts were carried up above the ground storey shafts of piers 1 and 3.The section, however, shows that well-marked vaulting shafts spring from
floor to roof, that the pier arches in the wall are probably distinct
and well understood, and that the angles of these piers are softened and
ornamented by shafts and other subordinate members.Altogether, it is
evident that that subdivision of labour (if the expression may be used)
which was so characteristic of the true Gothic style had here been
perfectly understood, every part having its own function and telling its
own story.To complete the style only required a little experience to
decide on the best and most agreeable proportions in size and solidity.In a century from the date of this church the required progress had been
made; a century later it had been carried too far, and the artistic
value of the style was lost in mere masonic excellence.San Michele and
the other churches of its age fail principally from over-heaviness of
parts and a certain clumsiness of construction, which, though not
without its value as an expression of power, wants the refinement
necessary for a true work of art.Externally, one of the most pleasing
features of this church is the apse with its circular gallery.In
Italian churches the gallery is usually a simple range of similar
arcades; here, however, it is broken into three great divisions by
coupled shafts springing from the ground, and these again subdivided by
single shafts running in like manner through the whole height of the
apse.The gallery thus not only becomes a part of the whole design,
instead of looking like a possible afterthought, but an agreeable
variety is also given, which adds not a little to the pleasing effect of
the building.View of the Apse of San Michele, Pavia.(From Du
Somerard, ‘Les Arts au Moyen-Age.’)]

There are at least two other churches in Pavia, which, though altered in
many parts, retain their apsidal arrangements tolerably perfect.One of
these, that of San Teodoro (1150), may be somewhat later than the San
Michele, and has its gallery divided into triplets of arcades by bold
flat buttresses springing from the ground.In the other, San Pietro in
Cielo d’Oro, dating from 1132, the arcade is omitted round the apse,
though introduced in the central dome.It has besides two subordinate
apses of graceful design, but inferior to the other examples.Though Milan must have been rich in churches of this age, the only one
now remaining tolerably entire is San Ambrogio, which is so interesting
as almost to make amends for its singularity.Historical evidence shows
that a church existed here from a very early age.It was rebuilt in the
9th century by Bishop Angelbert, aided by the munificence of Louis the
Pious, and an atrium was added by Bishop Anspertus; but except the apse
and “the canons’” tower, nothing remains of even that church, all the
rest having been rebuilt in the 11th or 12th century.During the late
restoration the bases of some of the columns of the 9th-century church
were discovered, and one of them is now visible in the pulpit enclosure.The disposition of the building will be understood from the annexed
plan, which shows both the atrium and the church.The former is
virtually the nave; in other words, had the church been erected on the
colder and stormier side of the Alps, a clerestory would have been added
to the atrium, and it would have been roofed over; and then the plan
would have been nearly identical with that of a Northern cathedral.The third (sexpartite) bay was revaulted in the 14th century with two
oblong quadripartite vaults, but these are now replaced by sexpartite
vaulting.The dome is probably an addition of the end of the 12th
century, and it is raised over what would otherwise have been the fourth
bay of the church.As it is, the atrium (Woodcut No.446) is a highly
pleasing adjunct to the façade, removing the church back from the noisy
world outside, and by its quiet seclusion tending to produce that
devotional feeling so suitable to the entrance of a place of worship.The façade of the building itself, though, like the atrium, only in
brick, is one of the best designs of its age; the upper loggia, or open
gallery, of five bold but unequal arches, producing more shadow than the
façade at Pisa, without the multitude of small parts there crowded
together, and with far more architectural propriety and grace.As seen
from the atrium, with its two towers, one on either flank, it forms a
composition scarcely surpassed by any other in this style.As now restored, the simplicity and line effect of the vaulted interior
is remarkable, and it is also a museum of ecclesiological antiquities of
the best class.The silver altar of Angilbertus (A.D.835) is unrivalled
either for richness or beauty of design by anything of the kind known to
exist elsewhere, and the _baldacchino_ that surmounts it is also of
singular beauty: so are some of its old tombs, of the earliest Christian
workmanship.Its mosaics, its pulpit, and the bronze doors, not to
mention the brazen serpent—said to be the very one erected by Moses in
the wilderness—and innumerable other relics, make this church one of the
most interesting of Italy, if not indeed of all Europe.Atrium of San Ambrogio, Milan.[297])]

Generally speaking, the most beautiful part of a Lombard church is its
eastern end.The apse with its gallery, the transepts, and above all the
dome that almost invariably surmounts their intersection with the choir,
constitute a group which always has a pleasing effect, and is very often
highly artistic and beautiful.The sides of the nave, too, are often
well designed and appropriate; but, with scarcely a single exception,
the west end, or entrance front, is comparatively mean.The building
seems to be cut off at a certain length without any appropriate finish,
or anything to balance the bold projections towards the east.The French
cathedrals, on the contrary, while they entirely escape this defect by
means of their bold western towers, are generally deficient in the
eastern parts, and almost always lack the central dome or tower.The
English Gothic architects alone understood the proper combination of the
three parts.The Italians, when they introduced a tower, almost always
used it as a detached object, and not as a part of the design of the
church.In consequence of this the façades of their churches are
frequently the least happy parts of the composition, notwithstanding the
pains and amount of ornament lavished upon them.Façade of the Cathedral at Piacenza.(From Chapuy,
‘Moyen-Âge Monumental.’)]

The elevation of the cathedral at Piacenza is a fair illustration of the
general mode of treating the western front of the building, not only in
the 11th and 12th centuries, but afterwards, when a church had a façade
at all—for the Italians seem to have been seldom able to satisfy
themselves with this part of their designs, and a great many of their
most important churches have, in consequence, not even now been
completed in this respect.Instead of recessing their doors, as was the practice on this side of
the Alps, the Italians added projecting porches, often of considerable
depth, and supported by two or more slight columns, generally resting on
the backs of symbolical animals.No part of these porches, as an
architectural arrangement, can be deemed worthy of any commendation;
for, in the first place, a column planted on an animal’s back is an
anomaly and an absurdity, and the extreme tenuity of the pillars, as
compared with the mass they support, is so glaring that even its
universality fails in reconciling the eye to the disproportion.In the
present instance the porch is two storeys in height, the upper being a
niche for sculpture.Its almost exact resemblance to the entrance porch
below is therefore a defect.Above there is generally a gallery,
sometimes only in the centre; sometimes, as in this instance, at the
sides, though often carried quite across; and in the centre above this
there is almost invariably a circular window, the tracery of which is
frequently not only elaborately but beautifully ornamented with foliage
and various sculptural devices.Above this there is generally one of those open galleries mentioned
before, following the <DW72> of the roof, though frequently, as in this
instance, this is replaced by a mere belt of semicircular arches,
suggesting an arcade, but in reality only an ornament.Almost every important city in Lombardy shows local peculiarities in its
style, arising from some distinction of race or tradition.The greater
number of these must necessarily be passed over in a work like the
present, but some are so marked as to demand particular mention.Among
these that of Verona seems the most marked and interesting.This Roman
city became the favourite capital of Theodoric the Goth—Dietrich of
Berne, as the old Germans called him—and was by him adorned with many
noble buildings which have either perished or been overlooked.There is
a passage in the writings of his friend Cassiodorus which has hitherto
been a stumbling-block to commentators, but seems to find an explanation
in the buildings here, and to point to the origin of a mode of
decoration worth remarking upon.In talking of the architecture of his
day he speaks of “the reed-like tenuity of the columns making it appear
as if lofty masses of building were supported on upright spears, which
in regard to substance look like hollow tubes.”[298] It might be
supposed that this referred exclusively to the metal architecture of the
use of which we find traces in the paintings at Pompeii and
elsewhere.[299] But the context hardly bears this out, and he is
probably alluding to a stone or marble architecture, which in the
decline of true art had aspired to a certain extent to imitate the
lightness which the metallic form had rendered a favourite.To return to Verona:—The apse of the cathedral seems to have belonged to
an older edifice than that to which it is now attached, as was often the
case, that being the most solid as well as the most sacred part of the
building.449) it is ornamented with
pilasters, classical in design, but more attenuated than any found
elsewhere; so that I cannot but believe that this is either one of the
identical buildings to which Cassiodorus refers, or at least an early
copy from one of them.(From Hope’s ‘History
of Architecture.’)]

At a far later age, in the 12th century, the beautiful church of San
Zenone shows traces of the same style of decoration (Woodcut No.450),
pilasters being used here almost as slight as those at the cathedral,
but so elegant and so gracefully applied as to form one of the most
beautiful decorations of the style.Once introduced, it was of course
repeated in other buildings, though seldom carried to so great an extent
or employed so gracefully as in this instance.Indeed, whether taken
internally or externally, San Zenone may be regarded as one of the most
pleasing and perfect examples of the style to be found in the North of
Italy.The cathedral at Modena is another good example, though not possessing
any features of much novelty or deserving special mention.That of Parma
is also important, though hardly so pleasing.Indeed, scarcely any city
in the Valley of the Po is without some more or less-perfect churches of
this date, none showing any important peculiarities that have not been
exemplified above, unless perhaps it is the apse of the church of San
Donato on the Murano near Venice, which is decorated with a richness of
marble decoration to which the purer Gothic style never attained, and
which entitles this church to rank rather with the Byzantine than with
the Lombard buildings of which we are treating, or a style so curiously
exceptional as to make it one of the most interesting churches,
historically, to be found in the North of Italy.Façade of San Zenone, Verona.Recent discoveries in Syria[300] have proved almost beyond a doubt that
the carved slabs with which it is adorned externally were borrowed from
some desecrated building on the coast of Syria—destroyed probably by the
Moslems—and brought to Venice, probably at the time when the church
acquired the remains of San Donato, in the beginning of the 12th
century.Whether brought then or at an earlier period, they belong to
the age of Justinian, certainly came from the East, and, mixed up with
Italian details of the period, make up an exterior as picturesque as it
is interesting to the student of the history of art in those days.It is extremely difficult to draw a line between the pointed and
round-arched Gothic styles in Italy.The former was so evidently a
foreign importation, so unwillingly received and so little understood,
that it made its way but slowly.Even, for instance, in the church at
Vercelli, which is usually quoted as the earliest example of the pointed
style in Italy (built 1219-1222), there is not a pointed arch nor a
trace of one on the exterior.All the windows and openings are
round-headed, and, except the pier-arches and vaults, nothing pointed
appears anywhere.Even at a later date than this the round arch,
especially as a decorative form, is frequently placed above the pointed
one, and always used in preference to it.Instead, therefore, of
attempting to draw a line where none exists in reality, it will be
better now to pass on from this part of the subject, and to take up the
older style at a point from which we can best trace the formation of the
new.The latter does not essentially differ from the former, except in
the introduction of the French form of the pointed arch and its
accompaniments.It remains only to say a few words on the peculiarities
which the round form of churches took in the hands of the early Lombard
architects, as well as on the campanile, which forms so striking a
feature in the cities of Northern Italy.On the boundary-line which separates the Guelfic from the Ghibelline
influence, there exist at Toscanella, near Viterbo, two churches of
great beauty of detail; but which, as might almost be predicated from
their situation, defy any attempt at classification.They are not
Gothic, for they have no vaults, nor does their style suggest any
vaulting contrivances.They are scarcely debased Roman, for the tracery
of their circular windows, their many-shafted doors, and generally their
details are such as to indicate a Northern rather than a Roman affinity;
and the Byzantine sculpture which is found in the pulpit was probably
taken from an earlier church—though an Italian Byzantine influence can
be traced in much of its decoration.Under these circumstances, it is
better to treat them as exceptional, than to attempt to give them a name
which might mislead without conveying any correct information.Maria, was erected in the
beginning of the 13th century (1206?), but is so unlike most buildings
of that age, that it is usually ascribed to the 6th or 7th.On a close
examination, however, all its details are found to be full of advanced
Romanesque forms.The pillars are rude Corinthian, with a Lombardic
abacus.They are widely spaced, having no vault to support; and the
mouldings of the arches are what we should call “Transitional Early
English.”

[Illustration: 451.Externally the façade is too plain to be quite pleasing, but this arises
from its depending originally on painting for its decoration—some traces
of which still remain, but the greater part has perished.Its three
doorways are richly and beautifully ornamented with shafts and
sculptured foliage, quite equal in detail to anything of the class to be
found in Italy, and its great circular window would not be thought out
of place at Chartres or Lincoln.Pietro is probably a century later than that of Sta.Maria, and its façade is richer and more elegant—a difference arising
more from those details being in this instance carved which in the
earlier church were painted.The design, however, deserves attention for
its historical, perhaps, even more than its artistic claims; for it was
this class of façade that Palladio and the architects of the
cinque-cento period seized upon, and, applying pilasters and pediments
of classical type, converted it into the fashionable churches which are
to be found in every part of Europe.[301]

[Illustration: 453.Elevation of the Exterior of Sta.The difficulty which the Italians never entirely conquered, was how to
amalgamate the sloping lines of the roofs of the aisles with the
horizontal lines of the rest of the façade.The gallery over the central
doorway enabled them very nearly to accomplish it in these Toscanella
churches, and if the same string-courses had been carried all across,
the whole might have been harmonised; but it was just missed, and, what
is strange, more so in the second than in the first example.In the earliest times of Christian architecture, as we have already
seen, the circular form of church was nearly as frequent as that derived
from the Roman basilica.In process of time the latter was found to be
much better adapted to the extended requirements of Christianity.Hence
in the 11th and 12th centuries, when so many of the early churches were
rebuilt and enlarged, most of the old circular buildings disappeared.Enough, however, remain to enable us to trace, though imperfectly, what
their arrangements were.Among those which have been illustrated, perhaps the most interesting is
that known as the church of San Stefano at Bologna, or rather the
circular centre of that congeries of seven churches usually known by
that name.It is one of those numerous churches of which it is impossible to
predicate whether it was originally a baptismal or a sepulchral edifice.In old times it bore both names, and may have had both destinations, but
latterly, at all events, the question has been settled by the compromise
usually adopted in such cases, of dedicating it to the first martyr, to
whom a sepulchral form of building is especially appropriate.Plan of the Duomo, Brescia.Elevation of Duomo at Brescia.Notwithstanding a considerable amount of ancient remains mixed up in the
details, no part of the present church seems older than the Carlovingian
era; while, on the other hand, its extreme irregularity and clumsiness
of construction point to a period before the 11th century.Its general
form is that of an extremely irregular octagon, about 60 ft.in
diameter, in the centre of which stands a circlet of columns, some
coupled, some single, supporting a semicircular dome.The circumscribing
aisle is covered with the usual intersecting ribbed vault of the 10th
century, but the whole is so rude as scarcely to deserve mention except
for its antiquity.The Duomo Vecchio of Brescia is ascribed to the 8th or 9th century, but
this date according to Cattaneo[302] can only be ascribed to an earlier
basilica church, the crypt of which still exists on the east side of the
Duomo.As will be seen from the plan, it is a large church, 125 ft.across over all, and is covered by a dome 65 ft.in diameter internally
supported by eight piers of plain design.The mode in which light is
introduced into the central compartment illustrates the various
tentative expedients by which the architects in that age attempted to
accomplish their object.First, there is a range of small windows in the
dome below the springing of the dome.In the dome itself there are four
circular sides, and, as if the architect felt that he was doing
something unusual and inartistic, he managed externally to confuse these
with the rudiments of the roof gallery.(From Isabelle, ‘Édifices Circulaires.’)
Scale 50 ft.It is not clear whether originally it had or was intended to have an
apse between its two round towers—where the foundations of some
buildings can still be traced; but these may be the remains of the early
church referred to.Turning from these, we find the round-arched Gothic style completely
developed in the church of San Tomaso in Limine, near Bergamo.From the
annexed plan it will be seen that the circular part is the nave or
entrance, as in Germany and England, in contradistinction to the French
mode of arrangement, where the circular part is always the sanctum, the
rectangular the nave or less holy place.In the centre stand eight pillars, supporting a
vaulted gallery, which forms a triforium or upper storey, and, with the
dome and its little cupola, raise the whole height to about 50 ft.A
small choir with a semicircular niche projects eastward.The dimensions of the building are so small that it hardly deserves
notice, except as a perfect example of the style of the 11th or 12th
century in Lombardy, and for a certain propriety and elegance of design,
in which it is not surpassed, internally at least, by any building of
its age.It is to be regretted that the idea was never carried out (at
any rate no example remains) on such a scale as to enable us to judge of
the effect of such a domical arrangement as is here attempted.The great
defect of all one-storeyed domes is their lowness, both internally and
more especially externally.This method of building a dome in two
storeys would seem calculated to obviate the objection; but though
common in small sepulchral chambers, it has never been tried on a scale
sufficiently large to enable us to judge of its real effect.After this
period the circular shape was so completely superseded by the
rectangular, that no further improvement took place in it.There is perhaps no question of early Christian archæology involved in
so much obscurity as that of the introduction and early use of towers.The great monumental pillars of the Romans—as, for instance, those of
Trajan and Antoninus—were practically towers; and latterly their tombs
began to assume an aspiring character like that at St.231), or those at Palmyra and elsewhere in the East, which show a marked
tendency in that direction.But none of these can be looked upon as an
undoubted prototype of the towers attached to the churches of the
Christians.At Ravenna, as early as the age of Justinian, we find a circular tower
attached to St.Apollinare in Classe (Woodcut No.412), and in the other
churches of that place they seem even then to have been considered
necessary adjuncts.[303] At the same time it is by no means clear that
they were erected as bell-towers; indeed the evidence is tolerably clear
that bells were not used in Christian churches till the time of Pope
Adrian I., some two centuries later.There is, I
think, no trace of their being sepulchral monuments, or that they were
designed or used as tombs; and unless they were, like the _sthambas_ of
the Buddhists, pillars of victory, or towers erected to mark sacred or
remarkable spots, it is difficult to say what they were, or where we are
to look for an analogy.Be this as it may, the oldest circular towers with which we are
acquainted are those of Ravenna; while the last of the series is the
famous leaning one at Pisa, commenced in the year 1174.The gradations
between these two extremes must have been the same that marked the
changes in the architecture of the churches to which they are attached;
but the links are more completely wanting in the case of the towers than
in that of the churches.[304]

[Illustration: 459.(From Gutensohn and
Knapp.)]Apollinare in Classe, above referred to, the most
perfect of those of Ravenna, is a simple brick tower (see Woodcut No.412), nine storeys in height, the lower windows being narrow single
openings; above there are two, and the three upper storeys are adorned
with four windows of three lights each.In Rome, as far as we know, the first tower attached to a church was
that said to have been built by Pope Adrian I. in front of the atrium of
St.Peter’s; but there are no examples now existing in Rome which can be
said to be earlier than the 11th century, and that date applies only to
the lower portion of them.In the 12th and 13th centuries they became
common, and we find them attached to the churches of S. Lorenzo without
the walls, S. Croce in Gerusalemme, SS.Giovanni e Paolo, S. Giorgio in
Velabro (13th century), and others.All these are square in plan and
extremely similar in design, no improvement and scarcely any change
having taken place between the first and the last, as if the form were
an old and established one when we find it first adopted.Maria in Cosmedin (Woodcut No.459) is perhaps one of the best
and most complete.Its dimensions are small, its breadth being little
more than 15 ft., and its height only 110; but notwithstanding this
there is great dignity in the design, and, in a city where buildings are
not generally tall, its height is sufficient to give it prominence
without overpowering other objects,—a characteristic which renders these
Roman towers not only beautiful structures in themselves, but
appropriate ornaments to the buildings to which they are attached.The chief interest of these towers is derived from the numerous progeny
to which they gave birth: for though there is scarcely an instance of a
square Romanesque tower beyond the walls of Rome during the period in
which this style flourished, the form was seized upon with avidity by
the Gothic architects in all the countries of Europe; and whether as a
detached campanile (as in Italy), or as an integral part of the building
(as we soon find it employed on this side of the Alps), it forms the
most prominent, and perhaps also the most beautiful, feature in the
aspiring architecture of the Middle Ages.There is certainly no architectural feature which the Gothic architects
can so justly call their own as the towers and spires which in the
Middle Ages were so favourite, so indispensable a part of their churches
and other edifices, becoming in fact as necessary parts of the external
design as the vaults were of the internal decoration of the building.It is true, as before remarked, that we neither know where they were
first invented, nor even where they were first applied to Christian
churches—those of Rome and Ravenna being evidently not the earliest
examples; nor have they any features which betray their origin—at least
none have yet been pointed out, though it is not impossible that a
closer examination would bring some such to light.They certainly are as
little classical, in form or details, as anything that can well be
conceived; and belong to an undefined Romanesque style.Those of which we have already spoken are all church-towers—_campaniles_
or bell-towers attached to churches.But this exclusive distinction by
no means applies to the Gothic towers.Mark at Venice,
for instance, and the Toraccio at Cremona, are evidently civic
monuments, like the belfries of the Low Countries—symbols of communal
power wholly distinct from the church, their proximity to which seems
only to arise from the fact of all the principal buildings being grouped
together.This is certainly the case with a large class of very ugly
buildings in Italy, such as those attached to the town-halls of Florence
and Siena, or the famous Asinelli and Garisenda towers at Bologna.They
are merely tall square brick towers, with a machicolated balcony at the
top, but possessing no more architectural design than the chimney of a
cotton factory.Originally, when lower, they may have been towers of
defence, but afterwards became mere symbols of power.A third class, and by far the most numerous, of these buildings are
undoubtedly ecclesiastical erections; they are either actually attached
to the churches, or so placed with regard to them as to leave no doubt
on the matter.There is not, however, I believe, in all Italy a single
example of a tower or towers forming, as on this side of the Alps, an
integral part of the design.Sometimes they stand detached, but more generally are connected with
some angle of the building, the favourite position being the western
angle of the southern transept.Occasionally we find one tower placed at
the angle of the façade, but this is seldom the case when the tower and
the church are of the same age.It is so in the cathedral at Lucca, and
San Ambrogio at Milan; in the latter of which a second tower has been
added more recently to balance the older one.It does also happen as in
the instance of Novara, before quoted (Woodcut No.443), that two towers
are actually parts of the original design; this, however, is certainly
the exception, not the rule.In design the Italian campaniles differ very considerably from those on
this side of the Alps.They never have projecting buttresses, nor assume
that pyramidal form which is so essential and so beautiful a feature in
the Northern examples.In plan the campanile is always square, and
carried up without break or offset to two-thirds at least of its
intended height.This, which is virtually the whole design (for the
spire seems an idea borrowed from the North), is generally solid to a
considerable height, or with only such openings as serve to admit light
to the stairs or inclined planes.Above the solid part one round-headed
window is introduced in each face, and in the next storey two; in the
one above this three, then four, and lastly five, the lights being
merely separated by slight shafts, so that the upper storey is virtually
an open loggia (see Woodcut No.There is no doubt great beauty and
propriety of design in this arrangement; in point of taste it is
unobjectionable, but it wants the vigour and variety of the Northern
tower.So far as we can judge from drawings and such ancient examples as
remain, the original termination was a simple cone in the centre, with a
smaller one at each of the angles.At Verona an octagonal lantern is added, and at Modena and Cremona the
octagon is crowned by a lofty spire, but these hardly come within the
limits of the epoch of which we are now treating.So greatly did the
Italians prefer the round arch, that even in their imitation of the
Northern styles they used the pointed shape only when compelled—a
circumstance which makes it extremely difficult, particularly in the
towers, to draw the line between the two styles; for though pointed
arches were no doubt introduced in the 13th and 14th centuries, the
circular-headed shape continued to be employed from the age of the
Romanesque to that of the Renaissance.One of the oldest and certainly the most celebrated of the Gothic towers
of Italy, is that of St.Mark’s at Venice, commenced in the year 902; it
took the infant republic three centuries to raise it 180 ft., to the
point at which the square basement terminates.On this there must
originally have been an open loggia of some sort, no doubt with a
conical roof.The present superstructure was added in the 16th century;
but though the loggia is a very pleasing feature, it is overpowered by
the solid mass that it surmounts, and by the extremely ugly square
extinguisher that crowns the whole.Its locality and its associations
have earned for it a great deal of undue laudation, but in point of
design no campanile in Italy deserves it less.The base is a mere
unornamented mass of brickwork, slightly fluted, and pierced
unsymmetrically with small windows to light the inclined plane within.Its size, its height, and its apparent solidity are its only merits.These are no doubt important elements in that low class of architectural
excellence of which the Egyptian pyramids are the type; but even in
these elements this edifice must confess itself a pigmy, and inferior to
even a second-class pyramid on the banks of the Nile, while it has none
of the beauty of design and detail displayed by the Giralda of Seville,
or even by other Italian towers in its own neighbourhood.The campanile at Piacenza (Woodcut No.448) is, perhaps, more like the
original of St.Mark’s than any other, and certainly displays as little
beauty as any building of this sort can possess.That of San Zenone at Verona is far more pleasing.It is, indeed, as
beautiful both in proportion and details as any of its age, while it
exemplifies at once the beauties and the defects of the style.Among the
first is an elegant simplicity that always is pleasing, but this is
accompanied by a leanness and poverty of effect, when compared with
Northern examples, which must rank in the latter category.Jackson, in his work on Dalmatia and Istria, gives illustrations of
several towers in those countries which, in beauty of design, excel many
of the Italian examples.The Romanesque style would seem to have had a
much longer duration on the east side of the Adriatic than in Italy.Thus the tower of Spalato, a lofty campanile of six storeys in height,
commenced in the beginning of the 13th century and not terminated till
1416 (except the upper octagon and spire), is virtually in the same pure
Romanesque style throughout.Jackson notes also the continued
influence of Roman work of the 3rd century, by which it is surrounded,
and that fragments of ancient material, columns and capitals, have been
used up in its construction.The campaniles of Zara and in the island of
Arbe are both fine examples of Romanesque design.CHAPTER V.

It would be easier to define the limits and character of the styles of
Italian Mediæval Architecture in the centre and south of Italy by a
negative than a positive title.To call them the “non-Gothic” styles
would describe them correctly, but would hardly suffice to convey a
distinct idea of their peculiarities.Romanesque, or even Italian
Romanesque, would not be sufficient, because that term fails to take
cognizance of the foreign element found in them.That element is the
Byzantine, derived partly from the continued relations which such cities
as Venice or Pisa maintained during the Middle Ages with the Levant, and
partly from the intercourse which the inhabitants of Magna Gracia kept
up across the Adriatic with the people on its eastern shores.To such a
mixture of styles the term Byzantine-Romanesque would be quite
appropriate; and although there are in Apulia churches, such as Molfetta
and St.Angelo, which look more like Levantine designs than anything to
be found in other parts of Europe (except perhaps such buildings as St.Front, Périgueux, and one or two exceptional buildings in the South of
France), and in a very detailed description of Italian styles it might
be expedient to attempt a further subdivision with other specific terms,
for the present it will probably suffice to describe the various
non-Gothic styles of the centre and southern half of Italy in local
sections without attempting any very minute classification of their
variations.As the Italians had no great national style of their own,
and both in the North and South were principally working under foreign
influences, it is in vain to look for any thread that will conduct the
student straight through the labyrinth of their styles.Italian unity is
the aspiration of the present century; during the Middle Ages it did not
exist either in politics or art.The Old and New Cathedrals at Naples.Although Naples is in the very centre of its province, where we
naturally first look for examples of the style, there are few cities in
Italy which contain so little to interest the architect or the
antiquary.Still she does possess one group of churches, which, by their
juxtaposition, at least serve to illustrate the progress of the style
during the Middle Ages.Restituta—shaded
dark in the plan (Woodcut No.460)—may be as old as the 4th or 5th
century, and retains its original plan and arrangement, though much
disfigured in details.The baptistery, a little behind the apse on its
left, is certainly of the date indicated, and retains its mosaics, which
seem to be of the same age.of Anjou commenced the new cathedral at
right angles with the old, his French prejudices being apparently
shocked at the incorrect orientation of the older church.It is a
spacious building, 300 ft.long, arranged, as Italian churches usually
were at that age, with a wooden roof over the nave and intersecting
vaults over the side-aisles.Opposite the entrance of the old cathedral
is a domical chapel of Renaissance design, so that the group contains an
illustration of each of the three ages of Italian art.Section of San Miniato, near Florence.The church of San Miniato (Woodcuts Nos.461-463), on a hill overlooking
Florence, is one of the earliest (1013), as well as one of the most
perfect, of the Byzantine-Romanesque style.in length by 70 in width, divided longitudinally into aisles, and
transversely into three nearly square compartments by clustered piers
supporting two great arches which run up to the roof.The whole of the
eastern compartment is occupied by a crypt or under-church open to the
nave, above which are the choir and apse, approached by flights of steps
in the aisles.The entire arrangement, together with the division of the
nave into three compartments, is most satisfactory, and the proportions
of the whole are very appropriate.The pillars themselves are so nearly
classical in design that they almost seem to have been taken from some
ancient building, and the architraves and stringcourses are all well
designed and fitted to the places they occupy.The principal ornament of
the interior is an inlaid pattern of simple design, sufficient to
relieve the monotony of the interior, but without producing any
confusion.The exterior depends principally, like the interior, for its
effect on  panelling, but has a range of blind arches running
round the sides and across the front.The façade, however, is very badly
designed: either it was one of the earliest examples, and the architects
had not learned how to combine the sloping roofs of the aisles with the
upper part of the façades, or it has been altered in more modern times;
but for this slight defect it would be difficult to find a church in
Italy containing more of classic elegance, with perfect appropriateness
for the purposes of Christian worship.There must have been several, probably many, buildings in the same style
erected in Tuscany during the first half of the 11th century.Otherwise
it is almost impossible to understand how so complete a design as that
of Pisa Cathedral could have been executed.It was commenced apparently
in 1006, but it was not till 1063, after the plundering of Palermo,
according to Reber,[305] that the means were provided for the
extraordinary richness of the design, the magnificence of which had at
that time no parallel among the ecclesiastical edifices of Italy; the
work was suspended in 1095, and could only be resumed by means of
pecuniary aid given to the undertaking by the Byzantine emperor.After
the consecration of the cathedral in 1103, the interior decorations were
carried on until the 15th century.Internally its design is evidently
based on that of the basilicas of Rome and Ravenna, except that instead
of the range at the latter place of figures in mosaic, it has a splendid
triforium gallery and in plan strongly marked projecting transepts.Its
great merit, however, as a design arises from the fact that the builders
had learned to proportion the parts to one another so as to get greater
magnificence with very much smaller dimensions.The size, for instance,
of the nave of San Paolo fuori le Mure at Rome is 290 ft.by 215; these
dimensions are nearly double those at Pisa, where they are 173 ft.Yet, in consequence of the greater relative height of the nave and
the better spacing of the pillars and proportion of the parts, the
interior of Pisa is more pleasing and more impressive than the Roman
church.Its effect, too, is immensely increased by the truly Mediæval
projection of the transepts.In no church in Italy is there such poetry
of perspective as in looking anglewise across the intersection, and
seldom anywhere a more satisfactory interior than that of this church.(From Chapuy’s
‘Moyen-Age Monumental.’)]

The exterior, too, is almost equally pleasing.The side-aisles are
adorned with a range of blind arches running all round, adorned with
parti- marble, inlaid either in courses or in patterns.Above
this is a gallery, representing the triforium, carried all round, and in
the façades formed into an open gallery; a second open gallery
represents the sloping roof of the aisles, a third the clerestory, a
fourth the <DW72>s of the great roof.The difficulty here, as in almost
all Italian designs, is caused by the sloping roofs; but, with this
exception, the whole makes up a rich and varied composition without any
glaring false construction, and expresses with sufficient clearness the
arrangements of the interior.The dome is of later design, and, being
oval in plan, cannot be said to be pleasing in outline.The Italians were evidently delighted with their new style.It was
repeated with very little variation at Lucca, in the church of San
Michele (1188), only that the arcades stood free on the sides as well as
on the front.The façade of San Martino, in the same city, is in the
same style; so is that of the cathedral at Pistoja, and so is Sta.The arrangement was probably suggested by the porticoes of
Pagan temples; and were it not for the awkwardness caused by the sloping
line of the roofs, it might be characterised as one of the most
successful inventions of the age.In some instances, as in the façade of the Cathedral at Zara in Dalmatia
(Woodcut No.Jackson[306] was not begun
before the 13th century, the consecration taking place in 1285, the
difficulties of the design of the façade are to a great extent conquered
by reducing the arcades to mere decorative panelling, and more than this
by separating the design of the centre from that of the aisles by a bold
square pilaster.This is exactly the feature we miss at Pisa and Lucca,
where the want of it imparts a considerable degree of weakness to the
whole design.(From Sir Gardner
Wilkinson’s ‘Dalmatia and Montenegro.’)]

The plan of the Zara Cathedral (Woodcut No.466) is that usually adopted
in churches of this class; but it possesses a lady chapel and
baptistery, placed laterally in a somewhat unusual manner.Its
dimensions are small, being only 170 ft.The east end of this church, its doorways and windows, show, as might be
expected from its locality, a greater tendency towards Romanesque art
than can be found on the western shores of the Peninsula, but in
internal arrangements it belongs wholly to the Italian style.The cathedral at Trau, also in Dalmatia, illustrated in Mr.Jackson’s
work, is a fine example, which is not only built in one consistent style
throughout, but possesses the still rarer advantage of being completed
outside as well as inside, “instead,” as Mr.Jackson observes, “of
presenting, like so many Italian churches, a rough face of unfinished
brickwork or masonry awaiting in vain the splendid veneer of marble or
sculpture that never comes.” The main part of the church was built in
the first half of the 13th century.The floor is of the basilica type,
with nave (five bays, vaulted) and aisles, centre and side apses, and a
magnificent narthex, the full width of nave and aisles, with a sumptuous
portal of pure Romanesque design (1240), which is perhaps finer than any
example in Italy, and is only rivalled in its decorative sculpture by
those of the French portals.Jackson is of opinion that Dalmatian
art took a great departure under Hungarian rule, and followed more in
the direction of the purer Romanesque style than in that of the
Byzantine.The artists were foreigners, invited not only from Germany
but also from France.Villars d’Honecourt recounts his having been sent
for, and “French influence,” Mr.Jackson states, “may be detected in
some other churches in Hungary.” The portal of the church at Jak, in
Hungary, illustrated in Mr.Jackson’s work, is French in character, with
a profusion of orders carved with the zigzag fret and dentil very
similar to the later Norman work, and includes capitals “à crochet” such
as belong to French 12th-century work.The series of trefoil-headed
niches, with figures in them which rise above the doorway, are French in
character, and remind one of the façade of St.Père-sous-Vezelay.At
Cattaro, in Dalmatia, and at Veglia, in one of the islands of the
Quarnero, are other examples of fine Romanesque work of the 12th
century.Further south on the mainland of Italy, at Troja, we find a singularly
elegant cathedral church (1093-1115?)Its flanks and apse are perhaps even more elegant than anything in
the neighbourhood of Pisa.So is the lower part of its façade, which is
adorned with a richness and elegance of foliage characteristic of the
province where it is found; and the cornice that crowns the lower storey
is perhaps unmatched by any similar example to be found in Italy, either
for beauty of sculptural decoration or for appropriateness of profile.The upper part of the façade differs, however, considerably from that of
the examples just quoted.A great rose-window, of elegant but
ill-understood tracery, takes the place of the arcades, and, with the
sculptured arch over it, completes all that remains of the original
design.The plain pieces of walling that support the central window are
parts of a modern repair.As a general rule, all the churches in the South of Italy are small.This one at Troja is arranged in plan like that at Pisa, with bold
projecting transepts, but its length is only 167 ft., and the width of
its nave 50, while in the Northern cathedral these dimensions are nearly
double—310 ft.by 106—and the area four times as great.This is true of
all, however elegant they may be—they are parish churches in dimensions
as compared with their Northern rivals.Many also, as the cathedral at Bari (Woodcut No.469), have their apses
internal, which detracts very much from the meaning of the design, and
does away with the apsidal terminations, which are perhaps the most
beautiful features in the external design of Italian churches; while
they lack the great traceried windows which go so far to replace the
absence of the apse in English design.The annexed elevation of the east
end at Bari (Woodcut No.470) gives a fair idea of the general
arrangement of that part in the churches in Apulia.It is novel, and the
two tall towers with a central dome combine with elegant details to make
up a whole which it is impossible not to admire though it will not bear
comparison with the more artistic arrangements of Northern architects.Where the apse[308] is allowed to be seen externally, it is sometimes,
as at San Pellino (Woodcut No.471), an object of great beauty and
originality, but such examples are rare in the province, and the designs
suffer in proportion.(From a Sketch by
A. J. R. Gawen, Esq.)]In the richer churches, as at Pisa, a blind arcade is carried round the
flanks, sometimes with an open gallery under the eaves, as in German
churches, but this was far from being universally the case; on the
contrary, it would be difficult, as a typical example of the style, to
select one more characteristic than the flank of the church of Caserta
Vecchia (1100-1153) (Woodcut No.The windows are small but
numerous, and mark the number of bays in the interior.The transept is
slightly projected, and ornamented with an arcade at the top, and above
this rises a dome such as is found only in Calabria or Sicily.The tower
was added afterwards, and, though unsymmetrical, assists in relieving a
design which would otherwise run the risk of being monotonous.West Front of the Church of San Nicolo in Bari.(From a Sketch by A. J. R. Gawen, Esq.)]It was, however, on their entrance façades that the architects of
Southern Italy lavished their utmost care.The central doorways are
usually covered with rich hoods, supported by pillars resting on
monsters somewhat like those found in the North of Italy.Above this is
either a gallery or one or two windows, and the whole generally
terminates in a circular rose-window filled with tracery.As exemplified
in the front of Bittonto Cathedral (Woodcut No.473), such a composition
is not deficient in richness, though hardly pleasing as an architectural
composition.The same arrangement, on about the same scale, occurs at Bari, Altamura,
and Ruvo; and on a somewhat smaller scale in the churches of Galatina,
Brindisi, and Barletta.The great and peculiar beauty of the cathedral
at Bittonto is its south front, one angle of which is shown in the
woodcut; but which becomes richer towards the east, where it is adorned
with a portal of great magnificence and beauty.The richness of its open
gallery (under what was the roof of the side-aisles) is unsurpassed in
Apulia, and probably by anything of the same kind in Italy.View of the Interior of San Nicolo, Bari.The façade of San Nicolo at Bari (1197) is something like the last
mentioned, except that handsome Corinthian columns have been borrowed
from some older building, and add to the richness of the design, though
they hardly can be said to belong to the composition.Internally this
church seems to have displayed some such arrangement as that of San
Miniato (Woodcuts No.Instead, however, of improving upon it,
as might be expected from the time that had elapsed since the previous
one was erected, the Southern architect hardly knew the meaning of what
he was attempting.He grouped together the three pillars next to the
entrance, and threw arches across the nave from them, but these arches
neither support the roof nor aid the construction in any other way.They
do add to the perspective effect of the interior, but it is only by a
theatrical contrivance very rare in the Middle Ages, and by no means to
be admired when found.Most of these Apulian churches possess crypts almost as important as
that of San Miniato, some more so; and the numerous pillars in some of
these give rise to effects of perspective only to be found elsewhere in
such buildings as the Mosque at Cordova, or the cisterns at
Constantinople.As in the annexed example, from the cathedral at
Otranto, it is wonderful what space and what variety may be attained
with small dimensions by the employment of numerous points of support.This was the secret of most of the best effects produced by the Northern
architects; but the Italians never understood it, or practised it,
except in crypts.Perhaps it may have been that they thought it
necessary to sacrifice architectural effect to the exigencies of public
worship.Whether this were the cause or not, the result, as already
pointed out, was fatal to the architectural effect of many of their
designs, especially in the Northern province.In Southern Italy this is seldom the case, but the difference arose from
the fact that the naves of the churches had never vaulted roofs, and
were consequently separated from the aisles by single pillars instead of
composite piers.This took away all temptation to display mechanical
dexterity, and left the architect free to produce the best artistic
effect he was able to design with the materials at his command.Window in the South Side of the Cathedral Church at
Matera.No one who takes the pains to familiarise himself with the architecture
of these Southern Italian churches, can well fail to be impressed with
their beauty.That beauty will be found, however, to arise not so much
from the dimensions or arrangement of their plans, or the form of their
outline, as from the grace and elegance of their details.Every feature
displays the feeling of an elegant and refined people, who demanded
decoration as a necessity, though they were incapable of rising to any
great architectural conception.They excelled as ornamentists, though at
best only indifferent architects.It is impossible to render this evident in such a work as the present;
but besides the examples already given, a window (Woodcut No.478) from
the cathedral church at Matera (1270) will explain how unlike the style
of decoration is to anything with which we are familiar in the North,
and at the same time how much picturesque effect may be produced by a
repetition of similar details.The church itself has this peculiarity,
that its west front is plain and unimportant, and that all the
decoration is lavished on the south side, which faces the piazza.There
are two entrances on this face, that towards the east being, as usual,
the richer.Above these is a range of richly-ornamented windows, one of
which—a little out of the centre—is far more splendid than the rest
(Woodcut No.From this it is said that letters and rescripts from
the Greek patriarch at Constantinople used to be read, and it is perhaps
as elaborate a specimen of the mode of decoration used in these churches
as can be found in the province.Doorway of Church of Pappacoda, Naples.The same exuberance of decoration continued to be employed down to the
latest period of the art, and after Northern forms had been introduced
by the Angiovine dynasty at Naples.The doorway from the church at
Pappacoda (Woodcut No.479) is a type of many to be found in that city
and elsewhere in the architectural province.True, it is overdone to
such an extent that much of the labour bestowed upon it must be
considered as thrown away; but if a love of art induced people to labour
so lovingly in it, it is hard to refuse them the admiration which their
enthusiasm deserves.Another class of ornamental detail in which this province is especially
rich is that of bronze doors, of which some six or seven examples still
remain.Of these perhaps the finest are those of the cathedral at Trani.They were made in 1160, and for beauty of design, and for the exuberance
and elegance of their ornaments, are unsurpassed by anything of the kind
in Italy, or probably in the world.Another pair of doors of almost
equal beauty, made in 1119, belongs to the cathedral at Troja (Woodcut
No.468), and a third, which is still in a very perfect state,
constructed at Constantinople, in the year 1076, for the church of Mont
San Angelo; and is consequently contemporary with the doors of Sta.Sophia, Novogorod, and San Zenone, Verona, and so similar in design as
to form an interesting series for comparison.Other churches in the same style as those mentioned above are found at
Canosa, Giovenazzo, Molo, Ostuni, Manduria, and other places in the
province.Those of Brindisi, from which we should expect most, have been
too much modernised to be of value as examples; but there is in the town
a small circular church of great beauty, built apparently by the Knights
Templars, and afterwards possessed by the Knights of St.It is now
in ruins, but many of the frescoes which once adorned its walls still
remain, as well as the marble pillars that supported its roof.Being at
some distance from the harbour, the Knights of St.John built another
small church near the port, which still remains nearly unaltered.Although throughout the Middle Ages Rome went on building large
churches, it was in the debased-Roman style already referred to, fitting
together Roman pillars with classical details of more or less purity,
but hardly, except in their cloisters, deserving the name of a style.Perhaps the most original, as it certainly is one of the most beautiful,
things the Romans did, is the cloister of St.There the
little arcades, supported by twisted columns, and adorned with mosaics,
are as graceful and pleasing as anything of that class found elsewhere;
and as they are encased in a framework of sufficient strength to take
off all appearance of mechanical weakness, their unconstructive forms
are not unpleasing.The entablature, which is the ruling feature in the
design, retains the classical arrangement in almost every detail, and in
such purity as could only be found in Rome in the 13th century, when
this cloister appears to have been erected; but the style never extended
beyond the limits of that city, and thus has little bearing on the
thread of our narrative.The cloister of the Benedictine monastery adjoining the basilica of St.Paul’s outside the walls, is another example of the same kind in which
the columns present almost every variety of form; spiral, twisted,
fluted, and sometimes two or three of these combined, many of them, as
well as the entablature, being covered with mosaics.As already remarked, the architects of the southern half of the Italian
peninsula were generally content to adopt the Romanesque plan of
covering their naves with a wooden roof—for when an intersecting vault
is found it is clearly a French or German interpolation—but they often
employed one dome, generally over the altar, and used it as an ornament
both external and internal.The two illustrations already given of the
domes at Bari (Woodcut No.470) and Caserta Vecchia (Woodcut No.472)
show the form these usually took in the province.They belong to a type
not unusual in the East, but unknown to the Gothic architects of Europe.When called upon to roof their churches with stone, they almost
invariably adopted the domical in preference to the vaulted form, as at
Molfetta (1162), where they make a pleasing form of roof, not unlike
that of Loches Cathedral (Woodcut No.The great defect of domes
when thus employed is their height, which generally throws the whole of
the building out of proportion; and unless light is introduced through
openings in the drum, or in the dome itself, they are dark and gloomy.This is certainly the case at Molfetta, but otherwise the church seems
well designed and of pleasing proportions.To be successful, domes
should be low and flat internally; and any height required externally
must be given by a false dome, as at St.Mark’s, or as done by the
Renaissance architects generally.This was not so much felt when the building was square, and covered by
only one dome, like the baptistery or tomb of Mont St.Angelo, where
effect of space on the floor was not aimed at so much as a combination
of external dignity with limited dimensions in plan, and was attained by
the arrangement adopted.As will be observed, the pointed arch, as in
the tower at Gaeta (Woodcut No.489), is used in the basement, but above
this round arches with balusters for pillars, such as we should call
Saxon, though their age here may be the 12th century.Among the little bits of Orientalism that crop up here and there all
over the province, one of the most pleasing is the little tomb of
Bohemund at Canosa (1111).It is charming to find in Italy an Eastern
Kibleh with its dome, erected to contain the remains of a Christian
king.Though elegant, however, the dome is not fitted to the square, as
it would have been in more experienced hands, and the whole design is
somewhat badly put together.Its bronze doors are among its chiefest
ornaments, and are elegant, though inferior to numerous examples of the
same class in the churches of the province.Many other examples of Byzantine domical forms might be quoted as
existing in Southern Italy.It is not, however, so much in the forms as
in the details that the Eastern influence is felt, and that no less in
the churches which retain the basilican form of Ravenna than in those
which assume the domical form of Constantinople.The buildings of the Southern Province cannot certainly compete with
those of the Northern either in size or in daring mechanical
construction, but in detail they are frequently more beautiful, while
their forms are more national and less constrained.Their great
interest, however, in the eyes of the student, consists in their forming
a link between the Eastern and Western worlds, and thus joining together
two styles which we have hitherto been too much in the habit of
considering as possessing no point of contact.One of the best known, as well as one of the largest examples of this
class of buildings in Italy, is the baptistery at Pisa (seen partially
on the left side of Woodcut No.Internally it is, as nearly as may
be, 100 ft.in diameter, and the walls are about 8 ft.The dome itself, however, is only 60 ft.in diameter, and is
supported on four piers and eight pillars.These serve to separate the
central space from the aisle which runs round it, and which is two
storeys in height, but singularly ill-proportioned and clumsy in detail.The worst part of the design, however, is the dome, if dome it can be
called.Internally it is conical in form, and thrust through an external
hemispherical dome in a manner more clumsy and unpleasing than any other
example of its class.Externally, these defects are to some extent
atoned for by considerable richness and beauty of detail.It had
originally only one range of blind arcades, with three-quarter columns,
surmounted by an open arcade; an arrangement exactly similar to that of
the two lower storeys of the cathedral and the leaning tower (Woodcut
No.A considerable amount of pointed Gothic decoration was
afterwards added, which, though somewhat incongruous, is elegant in
itself, and hides to some extent the original defects of the design.But
the outline of the building and its whole arrangements are so radically
bad, that no amount of ornament can ever redeem them.Taken altogether, the Pisan baptistery is so very peculiar, that it
would be interesting if its design could be traced back to some
undoubted original.That this is possible will hardly be doubted by any
one at all familiar with the subject; meanwhile, the building most like
it that has been illustrated is the little church of San Donato, at
Zara.at the beginning of the 9th century, with materials taken
from ancient buildings, some of them of the best period of Roman
architecture.The two monolithic columns in front of the triple
sanctuary, and which are 30 ft.in height, bear testimony to the size
and importance of the temple they originally adorned, and the great
thickness of the walls and the size of the piers suggest a wealth of
material at the disposal of the builders.The rectangular building on
the south side Mr.Jackson considers to be coeval with the church; and
the chamber over it, which was on the same level and originally opened
on to the gallery round the aisles, formed a second church intended for
the use of the catechumens.The church is so built round that it is
impossible to say what its external appearance may have been.Both from
its resemblance to the Pisan baptistery and its own merits, it is an
interesting addition to our knowledge of those circular churches which
were such favourites with all the Christian architects in the
Carlovingian period.The resemblance in this instance is the more
remarkable, because the façade of the cathedral at Zara (Woodcut No.467) is in the Pisan style, only slightly modified by local
peculiarities.From what we already know, it seems undoubted that there
was a close connection—architecturally, at least—between Pisa and Zara.If this were fully investigated, it would probably throw considerable
light on the origin of the Pisan style, which has hitherto seemed so
exceptional in Italy, and also explain how the Byzantine element came to
be so strongly developed in what at first sight appears to be a
Romanesque style of art.Ground and Upper Storey of San Donato, Zara.The typical example of a tower in the Italian style is the celebrated
leaning tower at Pisa, partly seen in Woodcut No.It is, indeed, so
far as we at present know, the only one which carries out that
arrangement of numerous tiers of superimposed arcades which is so
characteristic of the style.The lower storey is well designed as a
solid basement for the superincumbent mass; its walls are 13 ft.in
thickness, and it is adorned with 15 three-quarter columns: its height
being 35 ft.The six storeys above this average 20 ft.in height, and
are each adorned with an open arcade.The whole is crowned by a smaller
circular tower, 27 ft.in height, in which the bells are hung.The
entire height is thus 182 ft.; the mean diameter of the main portion,
52.There is no doubt that it was originally intended to stand
perpendicular, though the contrary has been asserted; but before the
commencement of the fifth storey the foundations had given way, and the
attempts to readjust the work are plainly traceable in the upper
storeys, though without success.out of the
perpendicular,[309] which, though not sufficient to endanger its
stability, is enough to render it very unsightly.Even without this
defect, however, its design can hardly be commended; an arrangement of
six equal arcades, with horizontal entablatures, is not an expedient
mode of adorning a building, where elevation is the element of success.The introduction of strongly-marked vertical lines, or some variation in
the design of the arcades, would have greatly improved the design: and
so the Italians seem to have thought, for it was never repeated, and the
Pisan tower remains a solitary example of its class.Nothing at all resembling it occurs in the southern parts of the
province, though it must be admitted that they contain very few really
important towers of any sort.Perhaps the earthquakes to which a great portion of the country is
liable may have deterred the architects from indulging in structures of
great altitude; but it must be added that the idea of belfry or tower
did not enter into their municipal arrangements, and their towns are not
consequently illustrated by such towers as those of Venice, Cremona, or
Verona in the north.Of those which do exist that of Gaeta is perhaps as
picturesque as any.It was erected 1276-1290, and is both characteristic
of the style and elegant in outline.As will be observed, the lower
storey has pointed arches, while those above are all round; an
arrangement which, though to our eyes it may appear archæologically
wrong, is certainly constructively right, and the effect is very
pleasing, from the height and dignity given to the entrance.The two towers of the cathedral at Bari (Woodcut No.470) are not so
happy in design as this.They are too tall for their other dimensions,
and want accentuation throughout; while the change from the lower to the
upper storey is abrupt and ill-contrived.The tower at Caserta Vecchia
(Woodcut No.472) is low and squat in its proportions, and unfortunately
too typical of the towers in this land of earthquakes.As a rule, it may be asserted that the southern province of Italy is
singularly deficient in examples of civil or domestic architecture.Great monastic establishments existed there during the Middle Ages which
must have possessed buildings befitting their magnificence; but these
have either perished and been rebuilt, or have been so restored that
their original forms can hardly be recognised.There are, indeed,
cloisters at Amalfi and Sorrento; much more remarkable, however, for the
beauty of their situation than for their architecture, which is
extremely rude and clumsy.There are no chapter-houses: no halls or
conventual buildings of any sort.In this respect, the province forms a
remarkable contrast with Spain in the same age; though it must be
confessed that the North of Italy is also very deficient in conventual
buildings of the Middle Ages, the most magnificent and beautiful
belonging more to the Renaissance than to the Mediæval period.At Ravello there is the Casa Ruffolo, a picturesque palace of the 13th
century, still nearly entire: a strange mixture of Gothic and Saracenic
taste, but so exceptional, that it would not be fair to quote it as a
type of any style.It seems to owe its peculiarities more to the taste
of some individual patron or architect rather than to any national taste
or form of design.There are, however, several Hohenstauffen castles of tolerable
preservation, more or less typical of the domestic arts of the day in
which they were erected.One of the best preserved of these is that of
Castel del Monte, erected by Frederick II., 1240-44.It is an octagon in
plan, with octagonal turrets at each angle.across
its extreme breadth, and surrounds a courtyard 57 ft.Both
storeys are vaulted, and all the details throughout are good and
pleasing.The whole is an admixture of Italian taste, superimposed on a
German design; but it will be observed how little removed the
architectural details of the entrance are, even at that early age, from
the style of the Renaissance.This is, indeed, the great characteristic
of the architectural objects in Southern Italy.Though they adopted
Christian forms, they never abandoned the classical feeling in details;
and it is this which mainly renders them worthy of study.Whether
considered in regard to dimensions, outline, or constructive
peculiarities, their churches will not bear a moment’s comparison with
those of the North; but in elegance of detail they often surpass purely
Gothic buildings to such a degree as to become to some extent as worthy
of study as their more ambitious rivals.Part Section, part Elevation, of Castel del Monte.POINTED ITALIAN GOTHIC.Fresco paintings—Churches at Vercelli, Asti, Verona, and Lucca—Cathedral

Before the commencement of the 13th century, the Italians had acquired
such mastery over the details of their round-arched style, and had
worked it into such originality and completeness, that it is surprising
that they should so easily have abandoned it for that form of Pointed
Gothic which they afterwards adopted.It is true the Italians never rose
to the conception of such buildings as the great Rhenish cathedrals,
like those of Spires and Worms, or the old churches at Cologne; nor did
they perhaps even rival the quasi-classical grace and elegance of the
Provençal churches; but at Verona, Modena, and indeed throughout the
North of Italy, they had elaborated a complete round-arched style, all
the details of which were not only appropriate and elegant, but seemed
capable of indefinite development in the direction in which they were
proceeding.They had also before their eyes the Romanesque style of Pisa
and Lucca with all its elegance, and the example of Rome, where the
architects steadily refused to acknowledge the pointed arch during the
whole of the Mediæval period.Yet in the beginning of the 13th
century—say 1220, when the cathedrals of Amiens, Salisbury, and Toledo
were designed—Italy too was smitten with admiration for the pointed
arch, and set to work to adapt it to her tastes and uses.It would be difficult to account for this, were we not aware how deeply
the feelings that gave rise to the Ghibelline faction were rooted in the
Italian soil.In all the cities, except Rome, the cause of the
Ghibellines was throughout the Middle Ages identified with that of
freedom and local independence, in opposition to that of the Guelfs,
which symbolised the supremacy of the Pope and the clerical party.Knowing how strenuously this was resisted, we naturally expect to find
it expressed in the architecture of the country.Two, indeed, of the
great churches of Italy, Assisi (1228) and Milan (1385), were erected by
Germans in the German style of the day; but these are exceptional.The
form which the pointed-arched style took on its introduction, was that
of adaptation to the Italian style, in a manner which the Italians
thought more consonant with beauty and convenience than that adopted
north of the Alps.The elegance of
the details employed by a refined and cultivated people, and based on
classical traditions, goes far to redeem, in most instances, the defects
of their designs; but they never grasped the true principles of Gothic
art, and the fatal facility of the pointed arch led them more astray
after mechanical clevernesses than even the Germans.Still, it is an
original style, and, however imperfect, is well worthy of study.Before proceeding to describe the style more in detail, it may be well
to point out one of the principal causes which led to the more marked
features of difference between the Gothic architecture of Italy and that
of Germany and France.This was the distaste of the Italians for the
employment of painted glass, or at least their want of appreciation of
its beauties when combined with architecture.It will be explained in a future chapter how all-important painted glass
was to the elaboration of the Gothic style.But for its introduction,
the architecture of France would bear no resemblance to what it was, and
is.In Italy, indeed, the people loved polychromy, but always of the
opaque class.They delighted to cover the walls of their churches with
frescoes and mosaics, to enrich their floors with the most gorgeous
pavements, and to scatter golden stars over the blue ground of their
vaults; but rarely, if ever, did they fill, or design to fill, their
windows with painted glass.Perhaps the glare of an Italian sun may have
tended to render its brilliancy intolerable; but more probably the
absence of stained glass is owing to its incompatibility with
fresco-painting, the effect of which would be entirely destroyed by the
superior brightness of the transparent material.The Italians were not
prepared to relinquish the old and favourite mode of decoration in which
they so excelled.This adherence to the ancient method of ornamentation
enabled them, in the 15th and 16th centuries, to surpass all the world
in the art of painting, but it was fatal to the proper appreciation of
the pointed style, and to its successful introduction into the land.The first effect of this tendency was that the windows in Italian
churches were small, and generally devoid of tracery, with all its
beautiful accompaniments.The walls, too, being consequently solid, were
sufficient, by their own weight, to abut the thrust of the arches: so
that neither projecting or flying buttresses nor pinnacles were needed.The buildings were thus deprived externally of all the aspiring vertical
lines so characteristic of true Gothic.The architects, to relieve the
monotony arising from the want of these features, were forced to recur
to the horizontal cornices of the classical times, and to cover their
walls with a series of panelling which, however beautiful in itself, is
mere ornament—both unmeaning and inconsistent.Internally, too, having no clerestory to make room for, and no
constructive necessities to meet, they jumped to the conclusion that the
best design is that which covers the greatest space with the least
expenditure of materials, and the least encumbrance of the floor.With
builders this is a golden rule, but with architects it is about the
worst that can possibly be adopted.The Germans were not free from this
fault, but the Italians carried it still further.If on four or five
piers they could support the vault of a whole nave, they never dreamed
of introducing more.A French architect, though superior in constructive
skill, would probably have introduced eight or ten in the same space.An
Italian aimed at carrying the vaults of the side-aisles to the same
height as that of the nave, if he could.A Northern architect knew how
to keep the two in their due proportion, whereby he obtained greater
height and greater width in the same bulk, and an appearance of height
and width greater still, by the contrast between the parts, at the same
time that he gave his building a character of strength and stability
perhaps even more valuable than that of size.In the same manner the Northern architects, while they grouped their
shafts together, kept them so distinct as to allow every one to bear its
proportional part of the load, and perform its allotted task.The
Italians never comprehended this principle, but merely stuck pilasters
back to back, in imitation of the true architects, producing an
unmeaning and ugly pier.The same incongruities occur in every part and
every detail.It is a style copied without understanding, and executed
without feeling.The elegance of the sculptured foliage and other
details sometimes goes far to redeem these faults; for the Italians,
though bad architects, were always beautiful carvers, and, as a Southern
people, were free from the vulgarities sometimes apparent farther north,
and never fell into the wild barbarisms which too often disfigure even
the best buildings on this side of the Alps.Besides, when painting is
joined to sculpture in churches, the architecture may come to occupy a
subordinate position, and thus escape the censure it deserves.Unfortunately there are only two examples of any importance in this
style that retain all their painted decorations—St.Francis at Assisi,
and the Certosa near Pavia.From this circumstance they are perhaps the
most admired in Italy.In others the spaces left for colour are still
plain and blank.We see the work of the architect unaided by the
painting which was intended to set it off, and we cannot but condemn it
as displaying at once bad taste and ignorance of the true Gothic
feeling.One of the earliest, or perhaps the very first Italian edifice into
which the pointed arch was introduced, is the fine church of St.Andrea
at Vercelli, commenced in the year 1219 by the Cardinal Guala Bicchieri,
and finished in three years.This prelate, having been long legate in
England, brought back with him an English architect called, it is said,
Brigwithe, and entrusted him with the erection of this church in his
native place.(From Osten’s
‘Baukunst in Lombardei.’) Scale 100 ft.In plan, it is certainly very like an English church, terminating
squarely towards the east, and with side chapels to the transepts,
arranged very much as we find them at Buildwas, Kirkstall, and other
churches of this class and size, only that here they are polygonal,
which was hardly ever the case in England.But with the plan all
influences of the English architect seem to have ceased, and the
structure is in purely Italian style.Externally the pointed arch
nowhere appears, all the doors and windows being circular-headed; while
internally it is confined to the pier-arches of the nave and the
vaulting of the roof.The façade is flanked at its angles by two tall,
slender, square towers; and the intersection of the nave and transept is
covered by one of those elegant octagonal domes which the Italians knew
so well how to use, and which is in fact the only original feature in
their designs.The external form of this church is interesting, as
displaying the germs of much that two centuries afterwards was so
greatly expanded by a German architect in the design of Milan cathedral.A few years later, in 1229, a church was commenced at Asti, the tower of
which was finished in 1266.This allowed time for a more complete
development of the pointed style, which here prevails not only
internally, but externally.Tall pointed windows appear in the flanks,
and even the doorways assume that form, in their canopies, if not in
their openings.493) is a later addition, and a
characteristic specimen of the style during the 14th century.This
church is also one of the earliest examples in which those elegant
terra-cotta cornices of small intersecting arches seem to have been
brought to perfection.(From Chapuy, ‘Moyen-Âge
Monumental.’)]

The most remarkable church of this age is that of St.Francis at Assisi,
commenced in 1228, and finished, in all essentials at least, in 1253.It
is said to have been built by a German named Jacob, or Jacopo.Certainly
no French or English architect would have designed a double church of
this class, though, on the other hand, no Italian could have drawn
details so purely Northern as those of the upper church.In the lower
church there are hardly any mouldings to mark the style, but its
character is certainly rather German than Italian.This church depends
for its magnificence and character much more on painting than on
architecture.In the first place it is small, the upper church being
only 225 ft.width; and though the lower one has
side-aisles which extend the width to 100 ft., yet the upper church is
only 60 ft.in height, and the lower about 30, so that it is far too
small for much architectural magnificence.None of its details are equal
to those of contemporary churches on this side of the Alps.The whole
church is covered with fresco paintings in great variety and of the most
beautiful character, which justly render it one of the most celebrated
and admired of all Italy.On this side of the Alps without its frescoes,
it would hardly attract any attention.It is invaluable as an example of
the extent to which the polychromatic decoration may be profitably
carried, and of the true mode of doing it; and also as an illustration
of the extent to which the Italians allowed a foreign style and mode of
ornamentation to be introduced into their country.One of the purest and most perfect types of an Italian Gothic church is
that of Sta.Anastasia at Verona, commenced apparently in 1260.It is
not large, being only 285 ft.in length externally; but its arrangements
are very complete, and very perfect if looked at from an Italian point
of view.The square of the vault of the nave is the modulus, instead of
that of the aisles, as in true Gothic churches: owing to which the
pier-arches are further apart than a true artist would have placed them;
there are also no buttresses externally, but only pilasters.The
consequence of this is, that the arches have to be tied in with iron
rods at the springing, which internally adds very much to the appearance
of weakness, caused in the first instance by the wide spacing and
general tenuity.These bad effects are aggravated by the absence of a
string-course at the springing of the vault; and by the substitution of
a circular hole for the triforium, and a hexafoiled opening of very
insignificant dimensions for the glorious clerestory windows of Northern
churches.Altogether, though we cannot help being pleased with the
spaciousness and general elegance of design, it is impossible not to
feel how very inferior it is to that of churches on this side the Alps.One Bay, externally and internally, of the Church of
San Martino, Lucca.]The church of San Martino at Lucca, built about a century after Sta.Anastasia (middle of 14th century), presents a strikingly happy
compromise between the two styles.The pier-arches are still too wide—23
ft.in the clear; but the defect is remedied to some extent by the
employment of circular instead of pointed arches, and the triforium is
all that can be desired; the clerestory, however, is as insignificant as
it must be where the sun is so brilliant and painted glass inadmissible.It would be easy to point out other defects; but, taking it altogether,
there are few more elegant churches than this, and hardly one in Italy
that so perfectly meets all the exigencies for which it was designed.(From the ‘Églises
principales d’Europe.’) Scale 100 ft.The cathedrals of Siena and Orvieto (the former commenced in 1243, the
latter in 1290) are perhaps, taken altogether, the most successful
specimens of Italian pointed Gothic.They are those at least in which
the system is carried to the greatest extent without either foreign aid
or the application of distinctly foreign details.These two buildings,
moreover, both retain their façades as completed by their first
architects, while the three great churches of this style—the cathedrals
of Florence, Bologna, and Milan—were in this respect left unfinished,
with many others of the smaller churches of Italy.The church at Siena
illustrates forcibly the tendency of the Italian architects to adhere to
the domical forms of the old Etruscans, which the Romans amplified to
such an extent, and the Byzantines made peculiarly their own.I cannot
but repeat my regret that the Italians alone, of all the Western
Mediæval builders, showed any predilection for this form of roof.On
this side of the Alps it could have been made the most beautiful of
architectural forms.In Italy there is no instance of more than moderate
success—nothing, indeed, to encourage imitation.Even the example now
before us is no exception to these remarks, though one of the boldest
efforts of Italian architects.In plan it ought to have been an octagon,
but that apparently would have made it too large for their skill to
execute, so they met the difficulty by adopting a hexagon, which, though
producing a certain variety of perspective, fits awkwardly with the
lines of columns, and twists the vaults to an unpleasant extent.Still,
a dome of moderate height, and 58 ft.in diameter, covering the centre
of the church, and with sufficient space around to give it dignity, is a
noble and pleasing feature, the merit of which it is impossible to deny.Combined with the rich colouring and gorgeous furniture of the church,
it makes up a whole of great beauty.The circular pier-arches, however,
and the black and white stripes by which the exterior is marked, detract
considerably from the effect of the whole—at least in the eyes of
strangers, though the Italians still consider it a beauty.The façade of
this cathedral is represented in Woodcut No.It consists of three
great portals, the arches of which are equal in size, though the centre
doorway is larger than those at the sides.Above is the invariable
circular window of the Italian architects, and the whole is crowned by
steep triangular gables.Beneath the cathedral, or rather under the
choir, is the ancient baptistery, now the church of St.John the
Baptist; its front is in a much purer style of Gothic than the
cathedral.[310]

[Illustration: 498.Façade of the Cathedral at Siena.]The carved architectural ornaments of the façade are rich and elaborate
in the extreme, though figured sculpture is used to a much less extent
than in Northern portals of the same age.It is also observable that the
strong horizontal lines do not harmonise with the aspiring character of
pointed architecture.The cathedral of Orvieto is smaller and simpler, and less rich in its
decorations, than that at Siena, with the exception of its façade, which
is adorned with sculpture and painting.Indeed the three-gabled front
may be considered the typical one for churches of this class.The
façades intended to have been applied to the churches at Florence,
Bologna, Milan, and elsewhere, were no doubt very similar to that
represented in Woodcut No.As a frontispiece, if elaborately
sculptured and painted, it is not without considerable appropriateness
and even beauty; but, as an architectural object, it is infinitely
inferior to the double-towered façades of the Northern cathedrals, or
even to those with only one great tower in the centre.It has besides
the defect of not expressing what is behind it; the central gable being
always higher than the roof, and the two others merely ornamental
appendages.Indeed, like the Italian Gothic buildings generally, it
depended on painting, sculpture, and carving for its effect, far more
than on architectural design properly so called.Among the greatest and most complete examples of Italian Gothic is the
church of Sta.Maria dei Fiori, the cathedral of Florence, one of the
largest and finest churches produced in the Middle Ages—as far as mere
grandeur of conception goes, perhaps the very best, though considerably
marred in execution from defects of style, which are too apparent in
every part.(From Isabelle,
‘Édifices Circulaires.’) Scale 100 ft.The building of the church was commenced in the year 1294 or 1298 (it is
not quite clear which), from the designs and under the superintendence
of Arnolfo di Lapo, for unfortunately in this style we know the names of
all the architects, and all the churches show traces of the caprice and
of the misdirected efforts of individuals, instead of the combined
national movement which produced such splendid results in France and
England.It is not known how far Arnolfo had carried the building when
he died, in 1310, but probably up to the springing of the vaults.After
this the works proceeded more leisurely, but the nave and smaller domes
of the choir were no doubt completed as we now find them in the first
twenty years of the 14th century.The great octagon remained unfinished,
and, if covered in at all, it was only by a wooden roof of domical
outline externally, which seems to be that represented in the fresco in
the convent of San Marco, till Brunelleschi commenced the present dome
in 1420, and completed it in all essential parts before his death, which
happened in 1444.The building may therefore be considered as
essentially contemporary with the cathedral of Cologne, which it very
nearly equals in size (its area being 84,802 ft., while that of Cologne
is estimated at 91,000), and, as far as mere conception of plan goes,
there can be little doubt but that the Florentine cathedral far
surpasses its German rival.Nothing indeed can be finer than its general
ground-plan.A vast nave leads to an enormous dome, extending into the
triapsal arrangement so common in the early churches of Cologne, and
which was repeated in the last and greatest effort of the Middle Ages,
or rather the first of the new school—the great church of St.In the Florentine church all these parts are better subordinated
and proportioned than in any other example, and the mode in which the
effect increases and the whole expands as we approach from the entrance
to the sanctum is unrivalled.Like all inexperienced architects, Arnolfo seems to have
thought that largeness of parts would add to the greatness of the whole,
and thus used only four great arches in the whole length of his nave,
giving the central aisle a width of 55 ft.of that of Cologne, and the height about the same; and
yet, in appearance, the height is about half, and the breadth less than
half, owing to the better proportion of the parts and to the superior
appropriateness in the details on the part of the German cathedral.At
Florence the details are positively ugly.The windows of the side-aisles
are small and misplaced, those of the clerestory mere circular holes.The proportion of the aisles one to another is bad, the vaults
ill-formed, and altogether a colder and less effective design was not
produced in the Middle Ages.The triapsal choir is not so objectionable
as the nave, but there are large plain spaces that now look cold and
flat; the windows are too few and small, and there is a gloom about the
whole which is very unsatisfactory.It is nearly certain that the
original intention was to paint the walls, and not to colour the
windows, so that these defects are hardly chargeable to the original
design, and would not be apparent now were it not that in a moment of
mistaken enthusiasm the Florentines were seized with a desire to imitate
the true style of Gothic art, and rival Northern cathedrals in the glory
of their painted glass.This, in a church whose windows were designed
only of such dimensions as were sufficient to admit the requisite
quantity of white light, was fatal.Notwithstanding the beauty of the
glass itself, which seems to have been executed at Lubeck, 1434, from
Italian designs, it is so completely out of place that it only produces
irritation instead of admiration, and has certainly utterly destroyed
the effect and meaning of the interior it was intended to adorn.Section of Dome and part of Nave of the Cathedral at
Florence.Part of the Flank of Cathedral at Florence.]Dome at Chiaravalle, near Milan.Externally the façade was never finished,[311] and we can only fancy
what was intended from the analogy of Siena and Orvieto.The flanks of
the nave are without buttresses or pinnacles, and, with only a few
insignificant windows, would be painfully flat except for a veneer of
 marbles disposed in panels over the whole surface.For an
interior or a pavement such a mode of decoration is admissible; but it
is so unconstructive, so evidently a mere decoration, that it gives a
weakness to the whole, and most unsatisfactory appearance to so large a
building.This is much less apparent at the east end, where the outline
is so broken, and the main lines of the construction so plainly marked,
that the mere filling in is comparatively unimportant.This is the most
meritorious part of the church, and, so far as it was carried up
according to the original design, is extremely beautiful.Even the
plainness and flatness of the nave serve as a foil to set off the
varying outline of the choir.Above the line of the cornice of the
side-aisles there is nothing that can be said to belong to the original
design except the first division of the drum of the dome, which follows
the lines of the clerestory.It has long been a question what Arnolfo
originally intended, and especially how he meant to cover the great
octagonal space in the centre.All knowledge of his intentions seems to
have been lost within a century after his death: at least, in the
accounts of the proceedings of the commission which resulted in the
adoption of Brunelleschi’s design for the dome, no reference is made to
any original design as then existing, and no one appears to have known
how Arnolfo intended to finish his work.Judging from the structure as
far as he carried it, and with the knowledge we now possess of the
Italian architecture of that age, we can easily conjecture what his
design for its completion may have been.Internally, it probably
consisted of a dome something like the present, but flatter, springing
from the cornice, 40 ft.lower than the present one, and pierced with
large openings on each of its eight faces.Section of Eastern portion of Church at Chiaravalle.(From Gruner’s ‘Terra Cotta Architecture in Italy.’) Scale 50 ft.Externally, two courses were open to him.The first and most obvious was
to hide the dome entirely under a wooden roof, as is done in St.George’s, Thessalonica (Woodcut No.305), or in the baptistery in front
of the cathedral, and is done in half the baptisteries in Italy—as at
Parma, for instance (Woodcut No.Had he done this, the span of the
dome might have been very much larger, without involving any
constructive difficulties, and the three towers over the choir and
transepts might have sufficed to relieve its external appearance
sufficiently for architectural effect.On the whole, however, I am
rather inclined to believe that something more ambitious than this was
originally proposed, and that the design was more like that of
Chiaravalle near Milan, built in 1221, and one of the most complete and
perfect of this class of dome now existing in Italy.Its external
appearance may be judged of from Woodcut 502, and its constructive
details from the section, Woodcut No.If the basement is sufficiently solid—and that at Florence is more than
sufficient for any superstructure of the sort—it is evident the
architect can dispose of such masses of masonry, that he can counteract
any thrust or tendency to spread that can exist in any dome of this
sort; and instead of being only 136 ft.across, 150 or 160 might easily
have been attempted.Instead of 375 ft., which is the height of the
present dome from the floor to the top of the cross externally, it might
even with the present diameter have been carried up to at least 500 ft.,
or as high as the church was long,—70 to 100 ft.Had this been done, the three smaller semi-domes must have been intended
to be crowned with miniature octagonal spires of the same class with the
great dome, and between these the vast substructures show that it was
intended to carry up four great spires, probably to a height of 400 ft.Had all this been done (and something very like it seems certainly to
have been intended), neither Cologne Cathedral, nor any church in
Europe, ancient or modern, would have been comparable to this great and
glorious apse.As it is, the plain, heavy, simple outlined dome of
Brunelleschi acts like an extinguisher, crushing all the lower part of
the composition, and both internally and externally destroying all
harmony between the parts.It has deprived us of the only chance that
ever existed of witnessing the effect of a great Gothic dome; not indeed
such a dome as might with the same dimensions have been executed on this
side of the Alps, but still in the spirit, and with much of the poetry,
which gives such value to the conceptions of the builders in those days.But for this change of plan, the ambition of the Florentines might have
been in some measure satisfied, whose instructions to the architect
were, that their cathedral “should surpass everything that human
industry or human power had conceived of great and beautiful.”

About a century later (1390), the Bolognese determined on the erection
of a monster cathedral, which, in so far as size went, would have been
more than double that at Florence.According to the plans that have come
down to us, it was to have been about 800 ft.long and 525 wide across
the transepts; at the intersection was to have been a dome 130 ft.in
diameter, or only 6 ft.less than that at Florence; and the width of
both nave and transepts was to have been 183 ft.: so that the whole
would have covered about 212,000 ft., or nearly the same area as St.Peter’s at Rome, and three times that of any French cathedral!Of this
vast design, only about one-third (Woodcut No.ft., was
ever carried out; but that fragment is quite sufficient to enable us to
judge of the merits or defects of this style in its state of greatest
perfection.The only other building in the same style on a sufficient
scale to admit of comparison with this is the nave of the cathedral at
Florence just described, but that is nearly as may be only half of its
dimensions, or 36,000 ft.The chapels, too, at
Bologna add practically a fifth aisle, giving great variety and richness
to the perspective.The varied heights and proportions of the central
and side aisles are singularly pleasing, and there being six arches at
Bologna instead of only four as at Florence, and twelve side chapels
where none exist in the other example, go far to redeem the lean
mechanical look which is the great defect of this style.The great
advantage San Petronio has over the Florentine church is in the size and
number of its windows, and these not being filled with stained glass the
whole church has a bright and pleasing effect that contrasts most
favourably with the gloom of its great rival.Notwithstanding this, the
nave of San Petronio cannot be considered as a successful work of art.In the first place it is too mechanically perfect.The area of the
points of support as compared with the voids is, as far as can be made
out from such plans as exist, about one-twelfth, which would be a merit
in a railway station, but something more is wanted in a monumental
building.In the next there is a singular deficiency of either
constructive or constructed ornament.On this side of the Alps an
architect with vaulting shafts, string-courses, galleries, and fifty
other expedients, would have relieved the bareness of the walls.At
Bologna it probably was intended they should be painted, and this never
having been executed may account for most of its apparent defects.In Gothic architecture one of two systems seems indispensable: either
painted glass with strongly-marked carved mouldings over the whole of
the interior, or white glass with flat surfaces suitable for opaque
paintings.Few cathedrals are complete in both respects at the present
day, but in their imperfect state the Northern system has an immense
advantage over the Southern.The architecture of our cathedrals is
complete and beautiful even in ruins.An Italian church without its
 decoration is only a framed canvas without harmony or meaning.Were San Petronio as complete in its  decoration as the Certosa
at Pavia or Monreale at Palermo, it might stand a fair competition with
the best interiors on this side of the Alps.As it is, it is only a
splendid example of ornamental but unornamented construction, and, as
was attempted to be explained in the Introduction, both elements are
wanted for success in architectural design.Section of San Petronio, Bologna.The exterior of the church is in too unfinished a state to enable us to
judge of what its effect might have been if completed, but many of its
details, especially of the façade, are of very great beauty, in many
respects superior to what is to be found on this side of the Alps.Its
central dome, however, never could have been a feature worthy of so vast
a church.In diameter it is equal, or nearly so, to that of Florence,
but the points of support are so small, and so far apart, that it must
have been mainly if not wholly of wood.No such towering structure as
Arnolfo’s vast substructures show that he intended, could have stood on
the slim supports of the Bolognese church.[312]

[Illustration: 506.(From ‘Chiesi
Principali d’Europa.’) Scale 100 ft.The cathedral of Milan—at once the most remarkable and one of the
largest and richest of all the churches erected in the Middle Ages—was
commenced in the year 1385, by order of Gian Galeazzo, first Duke of
Milan, and consecrated in 1418, at which date all the essential parts
seem to have been completed, though the central spire was not finished
till about the year 1440, by Brunelleschi.The design is said to have been furnished by a German architect,
Heinrich Arlez von Gemunden, or as the Italians call him, “da
Gamondia,”—a statement which is corroborated by the fact that the
details and many of the forms are essentially Northern; but it is
equally certain that he was not allowed to control the whole, for all
the great features of the church are as thoroughly Italian as the
details are German: it is therefore by no means improbable that Marco da
Campione, as the Italians assert, or some other native artist, was
joined with him or placed over him.In size it is, except Seville, the largest of all Mediæval cathedrals,
covering 107,782 ft.In material it is the richest, being built wholly
of white marble, which is scarcely the case with any other church, large
or small; and in decoration it is the most gorgeous—the whole of the
exterior is covered with tracery, and the amount of carving and statuary
lavished on its pinnacles and spires is unrivalled in any other building
of Europe.It is also built wholly (with the exception of the façade)
according to one design.Yet, with all these advantages, the appearance
of this wonderful building is not satisfactory to any one who is
familiar with the great edifices on this side of the Alps.Cologne is
certainly more beautiful; Rheims, Chartres, Amiens, and Bourges leave a
far more satisfactory impression on the mind; and even the much smaller
church of St.Ouen will convey far more pleasure to the true artist than
this gorgeous temple.The cause of all this it is easy to understand, since all or nearly all
its defects arise from the introduction of Italian features into a
Gothic building; or rather, perhaps, it should be said, from a German
architect being allowed to ornament an Italian cathedral.Petronio at Bologna as our standard of
comparison, it will be seen that the sections (Woodcuts Nos.505, 507)
are almost identical both in dimensions and in form, except that at
Milan the external range is a real aisle instead of a series of side
chapels; but, at the same time, it will be perceived that the German
system prevailed in doubling the number of the piers between the nave
and side-aisles.So far, therefore, the German architect saved the
church.The two small clerestories, however, still remain; and although
the design avoids the mullionless little circles of Bologna, there is
only space for small openings, which more resemble the windows of an
attic than of a clerestory.The greater quantity of light being thus
introduced by the tall windows of the outer aisle, the appearance is
that of a building lighted from below, which is fatal to architectural
effect.The model still preserved on the spot shows that the German architect
designed great portals at each end of the transepts.This, however, was
overruled in favour of two small polygonal apses.Instead of the great
octagonal dome which an Italian would have placed upon the intersection
of the whole width of the nave and transepts, German influence has
confined it to the central aisle, which is perhaps more to be regretted
than any other mistake in the building.The choir is neither a French
chevet nor a German or Italian apse, but a compromise between the two, a
French circlet of columns enclosed in a German polygonal termination.This part of the building, with its simple forms and three glorious
windows, is perhaps an improvement on either of the models of which it
is compounded.[313] (From
Wiebeking.)This is the nearest approach to the French chevet arrangement to be
found in all Italy.It is extremely rare in that country to find an
aisle running round the choir, and opening into it, or with the circlet
of apsidal chapels which is so universal in France.The Italian church
is not, in fact, derived from a combination of a circular Eastern church
with a Western rectangular nave, but is a direct copy from the old Roman
basilica.The details of the interior of Milan cathedral are almost wholly German
(Woodcut No.The great capitals of the pillars, with their niches
and statues, are the only compromise between the ordinary German form
and the great deep ugly capitals—fragments, in fact, of classical
entablatures—which disfigure the cathedrals of Florence and Bologna, and
so many other Italian churches.Had the ornamentation of these been
carried up to the springing of the vault, they would have been
unexceptionable; as it is, with all their richness, their effect is
unmeaning.Externally, the appearance is in outline not unlike that of Sta.Maria
dei Fiori; the apse is rich, varied, and picturesque, and the central
dome (excepting the details) similar, though on a smaller scale, to what
I believe to have been the original design of the Florentine church.The
nave is nearly as flat as at Florence, the clerestory not being visible;
but the forest of pinnacles and flying buttresses and the richness of
the ornamentation go far to hide that defect.The façade was left
unfinished, as was so often the case with the great churches of Italy.Pellegrini was afterwards employed to finish it, and a model of his
design is still preserved.It is fortunate that his plan was not carried
out.The façade was finished, as we now see it, from the designs of
Amati, by order of Napoleon.It is commonplace, as might be expected
from its age, but inoffensive.The doorways are part of Pellegrini’s
design, and the Mediæval forms being placed over those of the
cinque-cento, produce a strangely incongruous effect.For the west front
several original designs are still preserved.One of these, with two
small square towers at the angles, as at Vercelli and elsewhere, was no
doubt the Italian design.509) is preserved
by Bassi:[314] had this been executed, the façade would have been about
one-third (viz.Had the height of
the towers been in the same proportion, they would have been the tallest
in the world.In that case the effect here, as at Cologne, would have
been to shorten and overpower the rest of the building to a painful
extent.A design midway between the two, with spires rising to the same
height as the central one, or about 360 ft., would perhaps have the
happiest effect.At any rate, the want of some such features is greatly
felt in the building as it stands.The Certosa, near Pavia, was commenced about the same date (1396) as the
cathedral at Milan.It is seldom that we find two buildings in the
Middle Ages so close to one another in date and locality, and yet so
dissimilar.There is no instance of such an occurrence on this side of
the Alps, till modern times; and it shows that in those days the
Italians were nearly as devoid of any distinct principles of
architecture as we have since become.View of the Certosa, near Pavia.The great difference between Pavia and Milan is that the former shows no
trace of foreign influence.Petronio, and
by no means so complete or consistent in design.Nothing, in fact, can
be more painful than the disproportion of the parts, the bad drawing of
the details, the malformation of the vaults, and the meanness of the
windows; though all these defects are completely hidden by the most
gorgeous colouring, and by furniture of such richness as to be almost
unrivalled.So attractive are these two features to the majority of
spectators, and so easily understood, that nine visitors out of ten are
delighted with the Certosa, and entirely forget its miserable
architecture in the richness and brilliancy of its decorations.Externally the architecture is better than in the interior.From its
proximity to Pavia, it retains its beautiful old galleries under the
roof.Its circular apses, with their galleries, give to this church, for
the age to which it belongs, a peculiar character, harmonising well with
the circular-headed form, which nearly all the windows and openings
present.Even in the interior there are far more circular than pointed
arches.The most beautiful and wonderful part of the building is the façade.This was begun in 1473, and is one of the best specimens in Italy of the
Renaissance style.It would hardly, therefore, be appropriate to mention
it here, were it not that the dome over the intersection of the nave and
transepts is of the same age and style, but reproduces so exactly
(except in details) what we fancy the Mediæval Italian Gothic dome to
have been, that it may be considered as a feature of the earlier ages.502, it will be seen how like it is to that of
Chiaravalle in outline.It is less tall, however, and, if translated
into the details of the great church at Florence, would fit perfectly on
the basement there prepared for such a feature.Like many other churches in Northern Italy, the principal parts of the
Certosa are built in brick, and the ornamental details executed in
terra-cotta.Some of the latter, especially in the cloisters, are as
beautiful as any executed in stone in any part of Italy during the
Middle Ages; and their perfect preservation shows how suitable is the
material for such purposes.It may not be appropriate for large details
or monumental purposes, but for the minor parts and smaller details,
when used as the Italians in the Middle Ages used it, terra-cotta is as
legitimate as any material anywhere used for building purposes; and in
situations like the alluvial plains of the Po, where stone is with
difficulty obtainable, its employment was not only judicious but most
fortunate in its results.It would be a tedious and unprofitable task to attempt to particularise
all the churches which were erected in this style in Italy, as hardly
one of them possesses a single title to admiration beyond the very
vulgar one of size.To this Santa Croce, at Florence, adds its
association with the great men who lie buried beneath it, and Sta.Maria
Novella can plead the circumstance—exceptional in that city—of
possessing a façade;[315] but neither of these has anything to redeem
its innate ugliness in the eyes of an architect.There are two great churches of this period at Venice, the San Giovanni
e Paolo (1246-1420) and the Frari (1250); they are large and richly
ornamented fabrics, but are both entirely destitute of architectural
merit.(From Hope’s ‘Architecture.’)
Scale 50 ft.A much more beautiful building is the cathedral at Como, the details of
which are so elegant and so unobtrusively used as in great measure to
make up for the bad arrangement and awkward form of the whole.In design
it is, however, inferior to that of the Duomo at Ferrara (Woodcut No.The latter does not display the richness of the façades of Siena
or Orvieto, nor the elegance of that last named; but among the few
Italian façades which exist, it stands pre-eminent for sober propriety
of design and the good proportions of all its parts.The repose caused
by the solidity of the lower portions, and the gradual increase of
ornament and lightness as we ascend, all combine to render it harmonious
and pleasing.It is true it wants the aspiring character and bold relief
of Northern façades; but these do not belong to the style, and it must
suffice if we meet in this style with a moderate amount of variety,
undisturbed by any very prominent instances of bad taste.The true type of an Italian façade is well illustrated in the view of
St.Francesco at Brescia (Woodcut No.512), which may be considered the
germ of all that followed.Whether the church had three aisles or five,
the true Italian façade in the age of pointed architecture was always a
modification or extension of this idea, though introduced with more or
less Gothic feeling according to the circumstances of its erection.At Florence there is a house or warehouse, converted into a church,—Or
(horreum) San Michele, which has attracted a good deal of attention, but
more on account of its curious ornaments than for beauty of design—which
latter it does not, and indeed can hardly be expected to, possess.Maria della Spina at Pisa owes its celebrity to
the richness of its niches and canopies, and to the sculpture which they
contain.In this the Italians were always at home, and probably always
surpassed the Northern nations.It was far otherwise with architecture,
properly so called.This, in the age of the pointed style, was in Italy
so cold and unmeaning, that we do not wonder at the readiness with which
the Italians returned to the classical models.They are to be forgiven
in this, but we cannot so easily forgive _our_ forefathers, who
abandoned a style far more beautiful than that of Italy to copy one
which they had themselves infinitely surpassed; and this only because
the Italians, unable either to comSprehend or imitate the true
principles of pointed art, were forced to abandon its practice.Unfortunately for us, they had in this respect in that age sufficient
influence to set the fashion to all Europe.(From Street’s
‘Brick and Marble in the Middle Ages.’)]

Of late work in Dalmatia the most remarkable is the Cathedral of
Sebenico (described in Mr.Jackson’s work), built entirely in stone and
marble, and without any brick or timber in its construction.It is a
cruciform building, covered over by a waggon-vault of stone, visible
both inside and outside.It was commenced from the design of Messer
Ambrosia, a Venetian architect, in 1435, to whom may be attributed the
nave and aisles up to the string-course above nave arches.The work was
continued after 1441 by another architect, Messer Giorgio, also from
Venice, who died in 1475, leaving the building still incomplete.The
style of the work is late Venetian Gothic, influenced in its later
portions by the Renaissance revival.The cloisters of the Badia at
Curzola, and of the Dominican and Franciscan convents at Ragusa, are
also beautiful specimens of late Italian Gothic.----------------------------

  Max Müller, who is the _facile princeps_ of the linguistic school in
  this country—in an inaugural lecture which he delivered when, it was
  understood, he was appointed to a chair in the Strasburg
  University—gave up all that has hitherto been contended for by his
  followers.He admitted that language, though an invaluable aid, did
  not suffice for the purposes of the investigation, and that the
  results obtained by its means were not always to be depended upon.Footnote 17:

  The term “Persistent Varieties” has recently been introduced, instead
  of “race,” in ethnological nomenclature, and, if scientific accuracy
  is aimed at, is no doubt an improvement.It is an advantage to have a
  term which does not even in appearance prejudge any of the questions
  between the monogenists and polygenists, and leaves undecided all the
  questions how the variations of mankind arose.But it sounds pedantic;
  and “race” may be understood as meaning the same thing.Footnote 18:

  The whole of this subject has been carefully gone into by the Author
  in a work entitled ‘Rude Stone Monuments’ published in 1872, to which
  the reader is referred.Footnote 19:

  All round the shores of the Mediterranean are found the traces of an
  art which has hitherto been a stumbling-block to antiquarians.Egyptian cartouches and ornaments in Assyria, which are not Egyptian;
  sarcophagi at Tyre, of Egyptian form, but with Phœnician inscriptions,
  and made for Tyrian kings; Greek ornaments in Syria, which are not
  Greek; Roman frescoes or ornaments, and architectural details at
  Carthage, and all over Northern Africa, which however are not Roman.In short, a copying art something like our own, imitating everything,
  understanding nothing.Franks for the
  suggestion that all this art may be Phœnician, in other words,
  Semitic, and I believe he is right.Footnote 20:

  The derivation of the two words Heathen and Pagan seems to indicate
  the relative importance of these two terms very much in the degree it
  is here wished to express.Heathen is generally understood to be
  derived from ἔθνος, a nation or people; and Pagan from _Pagus,
  Pagani_, a village, or villagers.Both are used here not as terms of
  reproach, but as indicative of their being non-Christian, which is
  what it is wished to express, and was the original intention of the
  term.Footnote 22:

  This will be best understood by looking at the section (Woodcut 7), in
  which it will be seen that the so-called coping or casing-stones were
  not simply triangular blocks, filling up the angles formed by the
  receding steps, and which might have been easily displaced, but stones
  from 7 to 10 feet in depth, which could not have been supported unless
  the work had been commenced at the bottom.On the other hand, it is
  difficult to understand how the casing-stones for the upper portion
  could have been raised up the sloping portion completed.It is
  probable, therefore, that the casing was commenced at the angles and
  was carried up in vertical planes, thus leaving a causeway of steps in
  the middle of each face, which diminished in width as the work
  proceeded; this causeway, a few feet wide only, on each face being
  then encased from the top downwards after the apex blocks had been
  laid.—ED.Footnote 31:

  I have ventured to restore the roof of the cella with a sikra (ziggur
  or ziggurah, according to Rawlinson’s ‘Five Ancient Monarchies,’ vol.395, et passim), from finding similar roofs at Susa, Bagdad,
  Keffeli, &c. They are certainly indigenous, and borrowed from some
  older type, whether exactly what is represented here is not clear, it
  must be confessed.It is offered as a suggestion, the reason for which
  will be given when we come to speak of Buddhist or Saracenic
  architecture.Footnote 73:

  Rich gives its dimensions: On the north, 600 feet; south, 657; east,
  546; and west, 408.But it is so ruinous that only an average guess
  can be made at its original dimensions.George Smith, in the
  ‘Athenæum’ of February 1876, wrote a letter giving an account of a
  tablet of the Temple of Belus at Babylon he had deciphered, which
  constitutes the only description found giving the dimensions thereof.The bottom stage was 300 feet square and 110 feet high, the second,
  with raking sides, 260 feet square and 60 feet high, the third 200
  feet square and 20 feet high, the fourth, fifth, and sixth each 20
  feet high and 170, 140, and 110 feet respectively.The top stage,
  which was the sanctuary, was 80 × 70 feet and 50 feet high, the whole
  height being thus 300 feet, the same as the width of the base.W.
  R. Lethaby, in his work on ‘Architecture, Mysticism, and Myth,’ gives
  as a frontispiece a restoration according to these dimensions, the
  appearance of which is more impressive and probably approaches more
  closely to the actual proportions of a ziggurat than any previously
  published, excepting that at Khorsabad, with which in general
  proportion it coincides.—ED.]Footnote 74:

  This chapter and that next following may be regarded as, in all
  essential respects an abridgment or condensation of the information
  contained in a work published by the author in 1851, entitled, ‘The
  Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis Restored,’ the only real difference
  being that the more perfect decipherment of the inscriptions since
  that work was published has caused some of the palaces and buildings
  to be ascribed to different kings and dynasties from those to whom
  they were then assigned, and proved their dates to be more modern than
  was suspected, for the oldest at least.The order of their succession,
  however, remains the same, and so consequently do all the
  architectural inferences drawn from it.Those readers who may desire
  further information on the subject are referred to the work alluded
  to.Footnote 78:

  dimensions of all the other edifices quoted throughout this work.Footnote 80:

  Botta’s great work on the subject, and its continuation, ‘Ninive et

  Space will not admit of my entering into all the reasons for this
  restoration here.If any one wishes for further information on the
  subject, I must refer him to my ‘Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis
  Restored,’ published in 1851.Nothing has occurred during the
  twenty-three years that have elapsed since that work was published
  that has at all shaken my views of the correctness of the data on
  which these restorations were based.On the contrary, every subsequent
  research has served only more and more to convince me of their general
  correctness, and I cannot now suggest any improvement even in details.[It should be noted that the author’s theory as to the covering over
  of the Assyrian halls with a flat roof carried on columns has never
  been accepted by foreign archæologists, and no trace has ever been
  found of the foundations which would be required to carry such
  columns.M. Place, who conducted the excavations at Khorsabad, and
  Messrs.Perrot & Chipiez, who, among others, have devoted much time
  and research to the subject, are of opinion that the halls were
  vaulted.It would be difficult now to determine the possibility of
  building vaults of thirty feet span in crude or unburnt brick, because
  we have no means of testing the resistance to crushing which such
  bricks might afford.The brick voussoirs found by M. Place in the
  arches of the town gates had been prepared in special moulds, and so
  completely dried that liquid clay had been used to cement them
  together.In some of the large halls, far away from the walls, and in
  some cases in the centre of the rooms, huge blocks of hard clay were
  found with their lower surface curved and covered with a layer of
  stucco; these masses were sometimes many metres long, one to two
  metres wide, nearly a metre thick.John journeyed to the bedroom.According to M. Place they formed
  part of a barrel vault covering the halls, and their size would
  account for the immense thickness of the walls constructed to carry
  them and resist their thrust, as well as for the peculiar shape of the
  halls; that is, their length as compared with their breadth.The
  sculptured slabs would seem to have been carved to be seen by a high
  side-light, which suggests openings of some kind, just above the
  springing of the vault, and above the flat roof of the smaller halls
  round.—ED.]Footnote 83:

  These gateways are extremely interesting to the Biblical student,
  inasmuch as they are the only examples which enable us to understand
  the gateways of the Temple at Jerusalem as described by Ezekiel.Their
  dimensions are nearly the same, but the arrangement of the side
  chambers and of gates generally are almost identical.These gates had
  been built 100 years at least before Ezekiel wrote.Footnote 84:

  Layard’s excavations here furnish us with what has not been found or
  has been overlooked elsewhere, _e.g._, a ramp or winding staircase
  leading to the upper storey (‘Nineveh and Babylon,’ 461).As explained
  above, I believe the tops of the walls, which are equal to the floor
  space below, formed such a storey.This ramp at Koyunjik would just
  suffice to lead to them, and goes far to prove the theory.If it was
  similarly situated at Khorsabad it would be in the part fallen away.Footnote 85:

  [This assumption is speculative, no trace of such dwarf columns having
  been found; to raise a solid wall thirteen feet thick to carry a
  gallery seems unlikely.—ED.]Footnote 86:

  This façade, as I read it, is identical with the one I erected at the
  Crystal Palace as a representation of an Assyrian façade, long before
  this slab was exhumed.Footnote 87:

  See Rawlinson, ‘Ancient Monarchies,’ vol.Footnote 88:

  It is called tomb by Strabo, lib.xvi., and Diodorus, xvii.112, 3;
  temple, Herodotus, i.Footnote 89:

  Texier shows columns on the fourth side.Weld Blundell in 1892 found a column with fluted base and Doric
  capital, but it did not apparently belong to the palace.Footnote 91:

  [It follows from what has already been pointed out in a note
  respecting the roofs of the Assyrian palaces; if, as is contended by
  French archæologists, the great halls were vaulted, Mr.Fergusson’s
  theory respecting the origin of the Persian columns partly falls to
  the ground; in that case it would seem more probable that the Persians
  owed their columnar architecture to prototypes of wooden posts,
  covered with metal plates, such as are described as existing in the
  Median palaces of Ecbatana, where Cyrus, the first Persian monarch,
  passed so many years of his life.—ED.]Footnote 92:

  The woodcuts in this chapter, except the restorations, are taken from
  Flandin and Coste’s ‘Voyage en Perse,’ except where the contrary is
  mentioned.Footnote 93:

  It is curious that neither Ker Porter, nor Texier, nor Flandin and
  Coste, though measuring this building on the spot, could make out its
  plan.Yet nothing can well be more certain, once it is pointed out.Footnote 94:

  ‘Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis Restored,’ p.[The prayer platform or talar represented on the tomb of Darius is
  extremely unlike any constructional feature such as an upper storey,
  and may have been placed there only to give dignity and importance to
  the figure of the king: the hall of the Palace of Darius could easily
  have been lighted by clerestory windows over the roofs of the smaller
  chambers on each side.—ED.]Footnote 95:

  It is very strange that this similarity, like the plan of the square
  halls, should hitherto have escaped observation.Had any one looked at
  the matter as a whole we should have been spared some restorations
  which are too absurd even to merit exposure.[The restorations referred to are those in which the columns of the
  Great Hall and of the porticoes are shown as isolated features
  standing on the platforms.The authors of these designs would appear
  to have been misled by Messrs.Flandin and Coste’s plan, in which the
  drains are shown as if they ran under the line of the wall proposed by
  Mr.Fergusson, the enclosing wall of the Great Hall.Weld
  Blundell’s researches (1891), however, have shown that the main drain
  really lies under the hall, and between the enclosure wall and the
  first row of columns, and that the vertical rain-water shafts which
  were built into the wall communicated direct with this main drain.These shafts, cut in stone, in some cases rise above the level of the
  platform, which show that they were not intended to carry off the
  surface water from the platform.Weld Blundell discovered also the
  traces of the foundation of walls at the angles where shown by Mr.It would seem that in course of time the platforms have
  become coated with so hard and uniform a covering as to suggest its
  being the natural surface; when once broken through, however, the
  evidences of foundations of various walls are abundant.—ED.]Footnote 96:

  M. Dieulafoy’s work on the Acropolis of Susa has just (1893) appeared,
  but, so far as the palace is concerned, his discoveries do not add
  much to our knowledge.He appears to have arrived at the conclusion
  that the great hall (which in plan resembles that of the palace of
  Xerxes—Woodcut 94) was not enclosed on the south side, but was left
  open to the court in the same way as the great reception halls of the
  later Parthian and Sassanian kings at Al Hadhr, Firouzabad, and
  Ctesiphon.Footnote 97:

  It is now generally considered that these two buildings were tombs;
  the projecting bosses, as shown on woodcut, are in reality sinkings,
  and were probably decorative only.—ED.Footnote 98:

  M. Dieulafoy claims to have traced the plan of a temple at Susa which
  consisted of a sanctuary the roof of which was supported by four
  columns, with a portico-in-antis in front, and a large open court,
  measuring about 50 ft.by 40 ft., in the middle of which was placed
  the fire-altar.The whole building was enclosed with a corridor or
  passage, with entrances so arranged that no one could see inside the
  temple from without.—ED.Flinders Petrie’s latest excavations at Medum have resulted in the
  discovery of small brick arches over a passage in the sepulchral pit
  of Rahotep of the 4th dynasty.Footnote 100:

  the outstanding questions with reference to this celebrated building.I have in consequence written and published a monograph of the Temple,

  “Toward the centre of the monument two large stones were found leaning
  at an angle the one against the other, and forming a sort of tent,
  like in Woodcut 124, under which was presently discovered a small
  statue of Minerva seated on a chariot with four horses, and an urn of
  metal filled with ashes, charcoal, and burnt bones.This urn, which is
  now in the possession of the Comte de Choiseul, is enriched in
  sculpture with a vine branch, from which is suspended bunches of
  grapes done with exquisite art.”—‘Description of the Plain of Troy,’
  translated by Dalzel, Edin.If this is so, this is no doubt the vessel mentioned, ‘Iliad,’ xvi.92; ‘Od.,’ xxiv.and why has not the fact of its existence been more insisted upon?Footnote 118:

  One of the most interesting facts brought to light in Dr.Schliemann’s
  excavations is that between the age of the “Ilium Vetus” of Homer,
  rich in metals and in arts, and the “Ilium Novum” of Strabo, a people
  ignorant of use of the metals, and using only bone and stone
  implements, inhabited the mound at Hissarlik which covered both these
  cities.This discovery is sufficient to upset the once fashionable
  Danish theory of the three ages—Stone, Bronze, and Iron—but,
  unfortunately, adds nothing to our knowledge of architecture.These
  people, whoever they were, built nothing, and must consequently be
  content to remain in the “longa nocte” of those who neglect the Master
  Art.Footnote 119:

  This tomb is considered by M. Renan (Mission de Phœnicie, Paris 1864)
  to be of Phœnician origin, who remarks generally on their work:
  “Phœnician tombs are generally excavated in the solid rock; their
  architecture is the carved rock without columns; they obtained all
  they could out of the solid rock, leaving it as they found it, with
  more or less attempt to make it graceful; the fact that it was worked
  before being transported suggests that as it left the quarry so it
  remained, no sound of hammer or saw being heard during its erection.”
  There is another tomb at Marathos also attributed to the Phœnicians,
  which is partly cut out of the rock and partially built in large
  blocks of masonry.Footnote 121:

  In reality the monument stands exactly over the centre of the rock-cut
  sepulchre.The section-line must, therefore, be understood to be
  carried back about 10 feet from the face of the monument.Footnote 122:

  near Malta, and generally wherever chambered tumuli are found.Footnote 128:

  A cast of these is to be found in the South Kensington Museum.Footnote 129:

  These antæ (parastades) or responds were destined in the first case to
  protect the angles of the wall, and in the second case to support the
  beams carried by them and the columns between, the sun-dried brick
  wall being not to be relied on; in the later Greek temples the walls
  were built in stone and marble, and the parastades became therefore no
  longer constructional necessities, being retained only as decorative
  features, of which so many others are found in the style.Footnote 130:

  The dimensions are 94 feet by 45, covering consequently only 4230
  feet.Footnote 132:

  This refers only to the columns and antæ; the lower portion of the
  walls, 3 feet 6 inches high, were in stone; above this clay bricks
  were employed in building the walls, and it was to the disintegration
  of these that we owe the preservation of the Hermes of Praxiteles,
  which was found embedded in a thick layer of clay.At first it was
  thought that this clay had been washed down from the neighbouring
  <DW72>s of the hill of Kronos.Footnote 133:

  M. J. Thacher Clarke, who directed the American expedition in 1881, is
  now occupied with a monograph on the subject, and a report by him was
  published in 1882.Footnote 134:

  A proto-Ionic capital of early date was found in 1882 on the summit of
  Mount Chigri, in the Troad, by Mr.J. Thacher Clarke, and is described
  in the American Journal of Archæology, Baltimore.Another
  example ascribed to Phœnician artists was found at Trapeza in Cyprus,
  and is now in the Louvre; both are of the same type as that which is
  represented in the ivory carvings from the north-western palace of
  Nimroud, now in the British Museum, so that the Asiatic origin of the
  order is thus confirmed.Footnote 135:

  Pausanias, viii.Footnote 137:

  [The earliest example in stone at Benihasan is of less diameter than
  the columns at Kalabscheh, so that it is difficult to draw this
  distinction; we have already shown also (p.115 note) that wooden
  shafts of the twelfth dynasty have been found at Kahun, and this and
  the existence of the base proves their wooden origin.If therefore the
  Greek Doric column was derived originally from Egypt, as Mr.Fergusson
  believed, then its earlier wooden parentage must be accepted.Further
  evidence on this subject however has been afforded by the discoveries
  at Olympia, and the references in consequence made to Greek authors;
  all these show without doubt that the columns of the temple of Hera
  were originally in wood, and were gradually replaced by stone.The
  theory that the pillars in Egypt or early Greece were built in
  brickwork or rubble masonry is not borne out by the discoveries at
  Tiryns, for the walls of the palace there, in rubble and clay mortar,
  were of such weak construction that posts of timber were required to
  carry the epistyle or beam, either isolated as columns or built up
  against the wall as antæ.Fergusson’s theory that a pillar, originally copied from the
  wooden post, is slenderer at first, and gradually departs from the
  wood form as the style advances, is borne out by the evidence of the
  Egypt lotus column; this, as found in the rock-cut tombs of Benihasan,
  is of very small diameter, and quite unequal to carry the weight of
  any stone superstructure; whereas afterwards in the temples at Thebes
  it assumes a proportion nearer that of the earliest Greek Doric
  example at Corinth.—ED.]Footnote 138:

  These facts have all been fully elucidated by Mr.Penrose in his
  beautiful work containing the results of his researches on the
  Parthenon and other temples of Greece, published by the Dilettanti
  Society.Footnote 139:

  For measurements we depend on Penrose, ‘Principles of Athenian
  Architecture,’ &c., fol.; and Cockerell, ‘The Temples of Egina and
  Bassæ,’ Lond.The details of the system were first publicly
  announced by Watkiss Lloyd, in a paper read to the Institute of
  British Architects in 1859; afterwards in an appendix to Mr.Cockerell’s work, and in several minor publications.Footnote 140:

  The pyramid-building kings of Lower Egypt seem to have had some
  distinct ideas of a system of definite proportions in architectural
  building, and to have put it into practice in the pyramid, and
  possibly elsewhere, but it has not yet been sought for in the other
  buildings of that age.At times I cannot help suspecting more affinity to have existed
  between the inhabitants of Lower Egypt and those of Greece than is at
  first sight apparent.Footnote 141:

  It was called Zoophorus (_life_ or _figure bearer_).Footnote 142:

  [The reasons which induced the late Mr.Fergusson to suggest an
  “opaion,” or clerestory, were fully set forth in the ‘True Principles
  of Beauty in Art,’ in 1849.A paper on the same subject was
  communicated by him to the Royal Institute of British Architects in
  1861, and published in their “Transactions” for that year.Since his
  death, however, Mr.Penrose’s discovery that the Temple of Jupiter
  Olympius at Athens was really octastyle has thrown a new light on the
  question of hypæthral temples; and, as Dr.Dorpfield remarks in his
  essay on the “Hypæthral Temple” (communicated to the R. I. B. A. on
  Dec.19): “The words of Vitruvius have now received quite another
  interpretation, through the excavation of the Olympieion at Athens, to
  that which they have had up to the present.The most important proof
  of the hypæthral lighting of the temples of antiquity has now turned
  into a proof against the same;” and he concludes his arguments by
  stating: “After it has been shown by the excavations that the
  Olympieion at Athens is the sole example of a great hypæthral temple
  mentioned by Vitruvius, we can answer this much-vexed question of the
  lighting of the temples of antiquity in this way—that a few great
  dipteral hypæthral temples existed, but that the Greek and Roman
  temples had as a rule no light from above, and were only lighted from
  the door.”—ED.]Footnote 143:

  Among the many attempts made to restore the interior of this temple,
  the last and most elaborate is that by the late E. Beulé, ‘Acropole
  d’Athènes,’ 1854, vol.; but it is also one of the worst.Indeed it is quite painful to see how the author twists his
  authorities to meet a preconceived theory.Without going into it,
  there is one objection which seems fatal to the whole.Like most antiquaries when in difficulties for lighting Greek temples,
  he takes off the roof and makes the Temple of Pandrosus an open
  courtyard, in which he plants the olive.This is so opposed to the
  whole spirit of Greek art as to be inadmissible on general grounds,
  but in this instance it introduces the further absurdity that the
  Greeks opened three windows in the west wall of the temple to light
  this courtyard which was already open to the sky!The mode of lighting
  a temple by vertical windows is so exceptional that it would not have
  been introduced here had any other means existed of lighting the
  interior, and consequently the combination shown by M. Beulé seems
  simply impossible.Footnote 149:

  “Universo Templo longitudo est ccccxxv.Columnæ
  centum viginti septem a singulis regibus factæ, lx.pedum altitudine:
  ex iis xxxvi.cælatæ, una a Scopa.”—H.Wood places two in the pronaos and two in the posticum, thus
  reducing the depth of the opisthodomus; beyond the pronaos he places a
  vestibule and omits the staircases as shown on plan 159.Fergusson returned to the subject again, and published in the
  Transactions of the Institute (session 1882-83) a revised plan, to
  which we refer our readers.—ED.]Footnote 151:

  The finial ornament is triangular in plan, and there are three scrolls
  on the roof with mortices in them, showing that something must have
  stood on them to support the projecting angles.Dolphins and various
  other objects have been suggested.My own conviction is that they were
  winged genii, most probably in bronze, and gilt like the neckings of
  the capitals.Dorpfield is of opinion that in the Greek theatres of the best
  period there was no proscenium, or raised stage, and that the actors
  played their parts in the orchestra on the same level as the chorus.Professor Middleton also points out that in the earliest Greek
  theatres built in the 5th and 4th centuries B.C.the orchestra was a
  complete circle, the space being gradually diminished by the bringing
  forward of the stage.—ED.]Footnote 153:

  It will not be necessary to enter here into all the details of this
  restoration.They will be found in a separate work published by me on
  the subject, to which the reader is referred.[The student should also
  refer to the restoration suggested by M. Pullan in the work published
  by him and Sir Charles Newton (‘Discoveries at Halicarnassus, 1862’).In the arrangement and design of the podium it accords better with
  other examples of Greek tombs than Mr.The three columns
  as shown at the angle of Mr.Fergusson’s peristyle would be quite
  repugnant to any student of Greek architecture.—ED.]Footnote 155:

  The figures given in the text are all Greek feet: the difference

  The circumstance of Asoka, the Buddhist king of India B.C.250, having

  A diagram is given in ‘The True Principles of Beauty in Art’ p.459,

  These two temples, like almost all the others of Rome, have recently
  been renamed by the Roman or rather German antiquaries.The Jupiter
  Tonans is now the Temple of Saturn, and the Jupiter Stator is decreed
  to have been the Temple of Castor and Pollux.The names by which they
  are currently known has been adhered to, as the architecture is of
  more importance here than the archæology.Footnote 167:

  When the first edition of this work was written I believed the rotunda
  to have been added to the portico by Severus; and if this were so it
  would get over many of the difficulties arising from its size and the
  character of its brickwork.My personal examination, however, has
  forced me very unwillingly to give up this hypothesis.It certainly
  is, however, very astonishing that such a vault should have been
  attempted at so early an age.[There seems to be some probability that Mr.Fergusson’s first belief
  was correct, and that the Rotunda was built by Hadrian, bricks with
  the stamp of his period having been found in the casing and in the
  bond courses in the solid concrete both of the drum and in the dome.The discovery is due to M. Chedanne, one of the “Grand Prix” students
  in the Villa Medici, who had selected the subject for his “Envoi de
  Rome,” and was allowed to superintend certain repairs and restorations
  which were required in the Pantheon.It would seem that the portico
  erected by Agrippa preceded a temple with cella of the ordinary form,
  the pavement of which has been found nearly seven feet below the floor
  of the present church.From this it follows that when the Rotunda was
  erected in the first half of the second century, the portico, which is
  undoubtedly of Agrippa’s time, must have been taken down and rebuilt
  on to it, and this explains Mr.Fergusson’s reasons for insisting that
  the portico was built on to the Rotunda.The theory as to the Pantheon
  forming part of Agrippa’s bath is thus disposed of.Independently of
  that, however, Prof.Middleton has pointed out that the discoveries
  made in 1882, by the removal of the block of houses at the back,
  showed that there was no connection whatever between the two
  buildings.Traces exist of the original marble lining, and of cornices
  which were continued round the dome, showing that originally the
  complete circuit was exposed to view.Middleton
  states, “if further proof were wanting to contradict the theory that
  the Pantheon was over the Calidarum or Laconicum of the bath, this is
  supplied by the fact that there is no trace of any hypocaust under the
  floor, but merely an ancient drain to carry away the rain-water that
  fell through the opening in the dome.The Pantheon, too, is on the
  north side of the Thermæ—a very improbable position for the Laconicum,
  or hot room, which was usually placed on the sunny side of the
  buildings.”—ED.]Footnote 170:

  The bronze plates which were removed by Pope Urban VIII.in 1626 to
  make cannon, and also for the great Baldachino in St.Peter’s, were
  taken from the portico; the coffers of the interior of the dome were
  decorated, according to Prof.Middleton, with mouldings in stucco
  painted and gilt.Footnote 171:

  This building is commonly called a temple, though it is not known to
  what deity it was dedicated.My own impression is that it was a tomb,
  or at least a funereal monument of some sort.Footnote 172:

  Owing to a misreading of Vitruvius’s statement respecting the temple
  it had always been classed as decastyle.Penrose’s researches
  published in the ‘Transactions of the Royal Institute of British
  Architects,’ vol.Footnote 173:

  See ‘The True Principles of Beauty in Art,’ where the reasons for this
  arrangement will be found stated at length.[See note on page
  272.—ED.]Footnote 174:

  Canina, in his restoration, shows a flat roof with coffers, so there
  is probably no exact authority for its form, though it seems to be
  generally agreed that the centre was not hypæthral.Footnote 175:

  This basilica is generally represented as having an apse at either
  end; but there is no authority whatever for this, and general analogy
  would lead us rather to infer that it was not the case.Middleton, however, is of opinion that an apse existed at both ends,
  and shows the same in his restoration of the plan of Trajan’s
  form.—‘The Remains of Ancient Rome,’ by J. H. Middleton, Fig.Footnote 176:

  One of the pillars of this basilica remained _in situ_ till the year
  1614, when it was removed by Carlo Maderno, by order of Paul V., and
  re-erected in the piazza of St.M. Maggiore, where it now stands as a
  monumental column, supporting a statue of the Virgin.The column, with
  its base and capital, is as nearly as may be 60 ft.in height; the
  whole monument, as it now stands, 140 ft.Footnote 177:

  As it was sunk slightly below the pavement of the peristyle, and
  drains leading from it were traced by Mr.Ashpitel, it was probably
  hypæthral.Footnote 178:

  The theatres of Curio and Scaurus were in timber, except the
  proscenium of the latter, which was partly decorated with marble and
  mosaics.The Theatre of Pompey, B.C.54, was in stone, and parts of it
  still exist (Prof.The Theatre of Marcellus was begun by
  Julius Cæsar, but not completed till 13 B.C., when it was opened by
  Augustus.It was subsequently restored after a fire by Vespasian, but
  the purity and simplicity of the architecture, and the refinement of
  the details, in comparison with those of the Colosseum, 70-80 A.D.,
  are in favour of the earlier date assigned to it.Middleton
  quotes another theatre, that of Cornelius Balbus (13 B.C.), built to
  the north-west of the Theatre of Marcellus.Middleton the Amphitheatre of Sutrium is of Roman
  origin, and but little earlier than the Colosseum at Rome.“There is
  really no evidence,” he says (p.76), “that amphitheatres were built
  by the Etruscans; and there can be little doubt that they were purely
  Roman inventions.”

Footnote 180:

  At the Crystal Palace it has always been found necessary to allow 6
  sq.Footnote 181:

  Considerable difference of opinion seems to exist as to the extent of
  the velaria which sheltered the arena; this was supported by masts
  fixed outside the upper part of the walls, resting on brackets, 14 ft.below the cornice, which was cut away to allow the mast to fit close
  against the wall.M. Gérôme suggests, in his well-known picture of the
  Roman gladiators, that the velaria extended over a portion of the
  arena only.Middleton states, “The awning did not, as has been
  sometimes supposed, cover the whole amphitheatre, a thing which would
  have been practically impossible, owing to the enormous strain of so
  long a bearing, far beyond what any ropes could bear.It simply sloped
  down over the spectators in the cavea, leaving the whole central arena
  uncovered.” In case of rain, however, this might have been
  inconvenient, and it would not have protected the spectators from the
  sun, supposing that the performances lasted the whole day.Besides,
  there is no reason why the masts should have been carried so high
  above the wall, as shown in the restoration in Prof.Middleton’s book,
  p.Alma Tadema is of opinion that the velarium extended over
  the whole arena, and was suspended on a principle similar to that of a
  suspension bridge, the ridge, or highest portion lying between the
  foci of the ellipse.This accounts in a much more satisfactory way for
  the height of the masts, and would afford facilities for the draining
  off of the rain on to the top of the gallery round.Footnote 182:

  These baths have been carefully measured by M. Blouet, who has also
  published a restoration of them.This is, on the whole, certainly the
  best account we have of any of these establishments.Middleton this magnificent hall appears to have
  been what Spartianus calls the _cella soliaris_, the ceiling of which
  he says was formed of interlaced bars of gilt bronze.When the
  excavations in this hall were being made, many tons of fragments of
  iron girders were found.Aitchison)
  compound girders, formed of two T bars riveted together, and then
  cased in bronze.A sort of lattice-work ceiling had been formed with
  these bronze-cased girders, the panels being probably filled in with
  concrete made of light pumice-stone, worked with fine stucco reliefs,
  painted and gilt.Middleton is of opinion that the central part
  over the swimming-bath was left open for the admission of light.In
  the upper part of the walls deep sinkings to receive the ends of the
  great girders which supported the ceiling are clearly visible.George’s Hall at Liverpool is the most exact copy in modern times
  of a part of these baths.The Hall itself is a reproduction both in
  scale and design of the central hall of Caracalla’s baths, but
  improved in detail and design, having five bays instead of only three.With the two courts at each end, it makes up a suite of apartments
  very similar to those found in the Roman examples.The whole building,
  however, is less than one-fourth of the size of the central mass of a
  Roman bath, and therefore gives but little idea of the magnificence of
  the whole.Footnote 187:

  The left-hand wing of this arch has since been restored by M.
  Viollet-le-Duc, and the right-hand wing cleared of the square building
  in front of it.Footnote 188:

  These two buildings are described further on (p.544) as Christian
  edifices.Footnote 189:

  Professor Middleton states: “This building appears to be a nymphæum,
  or a part of some baths of about the time of Gallienus (263-268
  A.D.).” It was known in the Middle Ages as the “Terme de Gallucio.”
  The site of the real Temple of Minerva Medica was discovered in 1887
  (according to the same authority) between the new Via Macchiavelli and
  the Via Buonarroti, about 7 ft.Footnote 191:

  M. de Saulcy has recently attempted to prove that these tombs are
  those of the kings of Judah from David downwards.Their architecture

  sarcophagus which is now in the Louvre under the title of that of
  David is probably of the same date as these tombs, or if anything more
  modern.Footnote 192:

  Though the dates of all these tombs at Cyrene are so uncertain, there
  seems little doubt that if any one thoroughly versed in the style were
  to visit the place, he could fix the age of all of them with
  approximate correctness.The one difficulty is, that a chronometric
  scale taken from the buildings at Rome, or even in Syria, will not
  suffice.Local peculiarities must be taken into account and allowed
  for, and this requires both time and judgment.Footnote 194:

  The Renaissance dome which fits best to the church on which it is
  placed is that of Sta.Maria at Florence; but, strange to say, it is
  neither the one originally designed for the place, nor probably at all
  like it.All the others were erected as designed by the architects who
  built the churches, and none fit so well.Footnote 229:

  [The apses on each side of central apse are said to be additions to
  the original structure.The triple apses in Greek churches are found,
  according to Dr.Freshfield (‘Archæologia,’ vol.44), only in churches

  Kleinasien und Nord Syria’ by Karl Humann and Otto Puchstein.Footnote 233:

  [This rule cannot be made a hard and fast one.Procopius states that
  in the central dome of the Church of the Apostles, Constantinople,
  “the circular building standing above the arches is pierced with
  windows, and the spherical dome which over-arches it seems to be
  suspended in the air.” In the church of St.Sergius at Constantinople
  the walls of the octagon, which are pierced with windows, are carried
  up to the vault, and in the church of Sta.Sophia at Thessalonica the
  windows are pierced in an upright dome cylindrical internally.In all
  these cases, however, there is a marked distinction between these
  examples and those of the lofty cylindrical drums which were employed
  in the Neo-Byzantine churches.Fergusson’s rule, therefore, with
  these exceptions, may be taken as absolute.—ED.]Footnote 234:

  Even if it should be asserted that this is no proof that the
  inhabitants of these countries were Buddhists in those days, it seems
  tolerably certain that they were tree-worshippers, which is very
  nearly the same thing.Procopius tells us that “even in his day these
  barbarians worshipped forests and groves, and in their barbarous
  simplicity placed the trees among their gods.” (‘De Bello Gotico,’

  The particulars and illustrations of this church are taken from a
  paper by Heinrich Keissenberger, in the ‘Jahrbuch der K. K. Commission
  für Enthaltung der Baudenkmale,’ 1860.A model of it, full size, was
  exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1867.Footnote 257:

  [It has been assumed that the Roman basilicas were taken possession of
  by the early Christians for their own religious services, but as Mr.G. G. Scott points out in his ‘Essay on the History of English Church
  Architecture,’ “there is no well-authenticated instance of the
  conversion of any Pagan basilica into a Christian church, whilst there
  are abundant examples of Pagan temples converted into Christian
  sanctuaries” (see Texier and Pullan’s ‘Byzantine Architecture,’ pp.Scott observes, “on the face of it
  improbable, if we reflect that the conversion of the government to
  Christianity had no tendency to render the existing basilicas less
  necessary for legal business, after the peace of the church, than they
  had been before that event.Christianity, unfortunately, could not
  abolish the litigious instincts of our nature, and after fifteen
  centuries of the gospel the legal profession still flourishes.” The
  buildings which were rendered useless by the official recognition of
  the new faith were not the basilicas but the temples, the fact being
  that the class of building known as a basilica (a term never used by
  either the writers or architects of Byzantine times), with its wide
  central nave and aisles with galleries over them lighted by clerestory
  or side windows, and covered with a timber roof, constituted the
  simplest and most economical building of large size which could be
  constructed to hold a vast assembly of worshippers; especially as the
  only features which can be looked upon as having any architectural
  pretensions, viz., the columns and their capitals, could be taken
  wholesale from temples and other Roman buildings.The semicircular
  apse, which alone in the Roman basilica served as a court of law,
  became the tribune for the bishop and presbyters.Scott is even inclined to assign an earlier and more independent
  origin for the basilican form.According to his theory the germ of the
  Christian basilica was a simple oblong aisleless room divided by a
  cross arch, beyond which lay an altar detached from the wall.This
  germ was developed by the addition of side aisles, and sometimes an
  aisle returned across the entrance, and over these upper aisles were
  next constructed and transepts added, together with the oratories or
  chapels in various parts of the building.Butler, in his work on
  ‘The Ancient Coptic Churches of Egypt,’ accepts this theory, as the
  churches of Egypt are rich in evidence that favours it.At the same
  time, the first great basilica erected by Constantine, viz., the
  Vatican (St.Peter’s), and the Lateran, (St.John Lateran), are of too
  great importance to warrant the suggestion that their origin should be
  sought for in the very small though possibly earlier examples in Egypt
  or the East.—ED.]Footnote 258:

  This probably refers to its foundation, for M. Cattaneo, in his work
  ‘L’architecture en Italie, 1890,’ judging by its ornamental detail,
  places the church in the second half of the seventh century.Footnote 259:

  ‘Antiquités,’ vol.Footnote 260:

  _Eodem_, vol.Alfred J. Butler’s work, already referred to, has thrown
  considerable light on the subject, though, as he was unable to visit
  any of the Coptic churches up the Nile, we are still left in doubt as
  to the age of the convent near Siout and other buildings.From
  comparison of the plans and descriptions given in Denon, Curzon and
  Pococke of these buildings, with those in Cairo and Old Cairo, Mr.Butler ascribes them to the fourth century, that which in fact is
  claimed for them as having been founded by Sta.On this
  subject he says, p.365: “Were there no more of evidence besides to
  determine the truth of this tradition, the plan of the Haikal (the
  central of the three chapels in a Coptic church) would decide it
  beyond question.The persistence with which certain churches are
  ascribed to Sta.Helena by a people utterly ignorant of history and
  architecture is in itself remarkable, and it is still more remarkable
  to find that these churches are always marked by a particular form of
  Haikal.Indeed, so regular is the coincidence, that a deep apsidal
  haikal with recesses all round it and columns close against the wall
  may be almost infallibly dated from the age of Sta.Helena.”

Footnote 262:

  The older church has been so altered and ruined by the subsequent
  rebuildings that it is extremely difficult to make out its history.It
  seems, however, to have been built originally above the site of an old
  Mithraic temple, which has recently been cleared out, and probably
  before the time of Gregory the Great.It was apparently rebuilt, or
  nearly so, by Adrian I., 772, and burnt by Robert Guiscard, 1084.The
  upper church seems to have been erected by Paschal, 1099-1118.The
  question is, to what age do the frescoes found on the walls of the
  older church belong?Some of the heads and single figures may, I
  fancy, be anterior even to the time of Adrian; but the bulk of the
  paintings seem certainly to have been added between his age and 1084,
  and nearer the latter than the former date.If it had not been
  entirely ruined in 1084 Paschal would not have so completely
  obliterated it a century afterwards.A considerable quantity of the
  materials of the old church were used in the new, which tends further
  to confuse the chronology.Footnote 263:

  The dates here given generally refer to the building now existing or

  giving a full quotation from Eusebius of Constantine’s basilica at
  Jerusalem, in which he points out that the orientation of primitive
  times is the reverse of that which has become general in later times,
  continues his enquiry into the evidence afforded by the numerous early
  basilicas in Rome itself.Of about fifty churches of early date, in
  forty of them the sanctuary is placed at the western end, and of the
  remaining ten (one of which is the great church of St.Paolo fuori le
  Mura), there are only seven which appear to have retained their
  original form, and which have an eastward sanctuary.The exact orientation of the sanctuary in each case has been added to
  the list.—ED.]Footnote 266:

  and four other domes.Procopius speaks of the church being surrounded
  within by columns placed both above and below, probably referring to
  galleries similar to those in St.Mark’s the columns exist in one storey only, and the main wall is
  carried up at the back of the aisles to give increased size inside.Footnote 280:

  In support of this statement he points out that twice during Christian
  times it had been found necessary to raise the floor of the church.The nave floor, which in 1857 was two steps below that of the aisles,
  was raised in 1881 to the same level; but two feet nine inches below
  the nave floor before it was raised there existed, according to Prof.Eitelberger, another mosaic pavement, which must have been the floor
  of the first basilica erected, and which was pulled down by Bishop
  Euphrasius in 543.This lower pavement extended also under the three
  chapels of the confessio, which suggests that these are part of the
  first basilica.Footnote 284:

  The same polygonal form is found in the apses of St.Apollinare in Classe, St.Apollinare in Nuovo, St.Vitale, all in Ravenna, and St.Footnote 285:

  The apses of two churches, of the 4th and 6th century respectively, in
  the island of Paros, are similarly fitted with marble seats: in the
  6th century church there are eight rows, so that the apse looks like a
  small amphitheatre.Footnote 286:

  That is on the supposition that the word kirk is derived from the
  Latin word “circus,” “circular,” as the French term it, “cirque.” My
  own conviction is that this is certainly the case.The word is only
  used by the Barbarians as applied to a form of buildings they derived
  from the Romans.Why the Germans should employ κυρίου οἶκος, when
  neither the Greeks nor the Latins used that name, is a mystery which
  those who insist on these very improbable names have as yet failed to
  explain.Footnote 287:

  small blind arches below, carried on corbels, and may be regarded as

               next
               next to p.Joseph A. Seiss and others pretend, the scientific
attainments required for the construction of such enduring monument
surpassed those of the learned men of Egypt, we must, of necessity,
believe that the architect who conceived the plan and carried out its
designs must have acquired his knowledge from an older people,
possessing greater learning than the priests of Memphis; unless we try
to persuade ourselves, as the reverend gentleman wishes us to, that the
great pyramid was built under the direct inspiration of the Almighty.Nearly all the monuments of Yucatan bear evidence that the Mayas had a
predilection for number SEVEN.Since we find that their artificial
mounds were composed of seven superposed platforms; that the city of
Uxmal contained seven of these mounds; that the north side of the palace
of King CAN was adorned with seven turrets; that the entwined serpents,
his totem, which adorn the east facade of the west wing of this
building, have seven rattles; that the head-dress of kings and queens
were adorned with seven blue feathers; in a word, that the number SEVEN
prevails in all places and in everything where Maya influence has
predominated.It is a FACT, and one that may not be altogether devoid of significance,
that this number SEVEN seems to have been the mystic number of many of
the nations of antiquity.It has even reached our times as such, being
used as symbol[TN-26] by several of the secret societies existing among
us.If we look back through the vista of ages to the dawn of civilized life
in the countries known as the _old world_, we find this number SEVEN
among the Asiatic nations as well as in Egypt and Mayab.Effectively, in
Babylon, the celebrated temple of _the seven lights_ was made of _seven_
stages or platforms.In the hierarchy of Mazdeism, the _seven marouts_,
or genii of the winds, the _seven amschaspands_; then among the Aryans
and their descendants, the _seven horses_ that drew the chariot of the
sun, the _seven apris_ or shape of the flame, the _seven rays_ of Agni,
the _seven manons_ or criators of the Vedas; among the Hebrews, the
_seven days_ of the creation, the _seven lamps_ of the ark and of
Zacharias's vision, the _seven branches_ of the golden candlestick, the
_seven days_ of the feast of the dedication of the temple of Solomon,
the _seven years_ of plenty, the _seven years_ of famine; in the
Christian dispensation, the _seven_ churches with the _seven_ angels at
their head, the _seven_ golden candlesticks, the _seven seals_ of the
book, the _seven_ trumpets of the angels, the _seven heads_ of the beast
that rose from the sea, the _seven vials_ full of the wrath of God, the
_seven_ last plagues of the Apocalypse; in the Greek mythology, the
_seven_ heads of the hydra, killed by Hercules, etc.The origin of the prevalence of that number SEVEN amongst all the
nations of earth, even the most remote from each other, has never been
satisfactorily explained, each separate people giving it a different
interpretation, according to their belief and to the tenets of their
religious creeds.As far as the Mayas are concerned, I think to have
found that it originated with the _seven_ members of CAN'S family, who
were the founders of the principal cities of _Mayab_, and to each of
whom was dedicated a mound in Uxmal and a turret in their palace.Their
names, according to the inscriptions carved on the monuments raised by
them at Uxmal and Chichen, were--CAN (serpent) and [C]OZ (bat), his
wife, from whom were born CAY (fish), the pontiff; AAK (turtle), who
became the governor of Uxmal; CHAACMOL (leopard), the warrior, who
became the husband of his sister MOO (macaw), the Queen of _Chichen_,
worshiped after her death at Izamal; and NICTE (flower), the priestess
who, under the name of _Zuhuy-Kuk_, became the goddess of the maidens.The Egyptians, in expressing their ideas in writing, used three
different kinds of characters--phonetic, ideographic and
symbolic--placed either in vertical columns or in horizontal lines, to
be read from right to left, from left to right, as indicated by the
position of the figures of men or animals.So, also, the Mayas in their
writings employed phonetic, symbolic and ideographic signs, combining
these often, forming monograms as we do to-day, placing them in such a
manner as best suited the arrangement of the ornamentation of the facade
of the edifices.At present we can only speak with certainty of the
monumental inscriptions, the books that fell in the hands of the
ecclesiastics at the time of the conquest having been destroyed.No
truly genuine written monuments of the Mayas are known to exist, except
those inclosed within the sealed apartments, where the priests and
learned men of MAYAB hid them from the _Nahualt_ or _Toltec_ invaders.As the Egyptians, they wrote in vertical columns and horizontal lines,
to be read generally from right to left.The space of this small essay
does not allow me to enter in more details; they belong naturally to a
work of different nature.Let it therefore suffice, for the present
purpose, to state that the comparative study of the language of the
Mayas led us to suspect that, as it contains words belonging to nearly
all the known languages of antiquity, and with exactly the same meaning,
in their mode of writing might be found letters or characters or signs
used in those tongues.Studying with attention the photographs made by
us of the inscriptions of Uxmal and Chichen, we were not long in
discovering that our surmises were indeed correct.The inscriptions,
written in squares or parallelograms, that might well have served as
models for the ancient hieratic Chaldeans, of the time of King Uruck,
seem to contain ancient Chaldee, Egyptian and Etruscan characters,
together with others that seem to be purely Mayab.Applying these known characters to the decipherment of the inscriptions,
giving them their accepted value, we soon found that the language in
which they are written is, in the main, the vernacular of the aborigines
of Yucatan and other parts of Central America to-day.Of course, the
original mother tongue having suffered some alterations, in consequence
of changes in customs induced by time, invasions, intercourse with other
nations, and the many other natural causes that are known to affect
man's speech.The Mayas and the Egyptians had many signs and characters identical;
possessing the same alphabetical and symbolical value in both nations.Among the symbolical, I may cite a few: _water_, _country or region_,
_king_, _Lord_, _offerings_, _splendor_, the _various emblems of the
sun_ and many others.Among the alphabetical, a very large number of the
so-called Demotic, by Egyptologists, are found even in the inscription
of the _Akab[c]ib_ at Chichen; and not a few of the most ancient
Egyptian hieroglyphs in the mural inscriptions at Uxmal.In these I have
been able to discover the Egyptian characters corresponding to our own.A a, B, C, CH or K, D, T, I, L, M, N, H, P, TZ, PP, U, OO, X, having the
same sound and value as in the Spanish language, with the exception of
the K, TZ, PP and X, which are pronounced in a way peculiar to the
Mayas.The inscriptions also contain these letters, A, I, X and PP
identical to the corresponding in the Etruscan alphabet.The finding of
the value of these characters has enabled me to decipher, among other
things, the names of the founders of the city of UXMAL; as that of the
city itself.This is written apparently in two different ways: whilst,
in fact, the sculptors have simply made use of two homophone signs,
notwithstanding dissimilar, of the letter M. As to the name of the
founders, not only are they written in alphabetical characters, but also
in ideographic, since they are accompanied in many instances by the
totems of the personages: e. g[TN-27] for AAK, which means turtle, is the
image of a turtle; for CAY (fish), the image of a fish; for Chaacmol
(leopard) the image of a leopard; and so on, precluding the possibility
of misinterpretation.Having found that the language of the inscriptions was Maya, of course
I had no difficulty in giving to each letter its proper phonetic value,
since, as I have already said, Maya is still the vernacular of the
people.I consider that the few facts brought together will suffice at present
to show, if nothing else, a strange similarity in the workings of the
mind in these two nations.But if these remarkable coincidences are not
merely freaks of hazard, we will be compelled to admit that one people
must have learned it from the other.Then will naturally arise the
questions, Which the teacher?The answer will not only
solve an ethnological problem, but decide the question of priority.I will now briefly refer to the myth of Osiris, the son of _Seb and
Nut_, the brother of _Aroeris_, the elder _Horus_, of _Typho_, of
_Isis_, and of _Nephthis_, named also NIKE.The authors have given
numerous explanations, result of fancy; of the mythological history of
that god, famous throughout Egypt.They made him a personification of
the inundations of the NILE; ISIS, his wife and sister, that of the
irrigated portion of the land of Egypt; their sister, _Nephthis_, that
of the barren edge of the desert occasionally fertilized by the waters
of the Nile; his brother and murderer _Tipho_, that of the sea which
swallows up the _Nile_.Leaving aside the mythical lores, with which the priests of all times
and all countries cajole the credulity of ignorant and superstitious
people, we find that among the traditions of the past, treasured in the
mysterious recesses of the temples, is a history of the life of Osiris
on Earth.Many wise men of our days have looked upon it as fabulous.I
am not ready to say whether it is or it is not; but this I can assert,
that, in many parts, it tallies marvelously with that of the culture
hero of the Mayas.It will be said, no doubt, that this remarkable similarity is a mere
coincidence.But how are we to dispose of so many coincidences?What
conclusion, if any, are we to draw from this concourse of so many
strange similes?In this case, I cannot do better than to quote, verbatim, from Sir
Gardner Wilkinson's work, chap.xiii:

     "_Osiris_, having become King of Egypt, applied himself towards
     civilizing his countrymen, by turning them from their former
     barbarous course of life, teaching them, moreover, to cultivate and
     improve the fruits of the earth.* * * * * With the same good
     disposition, he afterwards traveled over the rest of the world,
     inducing the people everywhere to submit to his discipline, by the
     mildest persuasion."The rest of the story relates to the manner of his killing by his
brother Typho, the disposal of his remains, the search instituted by his
wife to recover the body, how it was stolen again from her by _Typho_,
who cut him to pieces, scattering them over the earth, of the final
defeat of Typho by Osiris's son, Horus.Reading the description, above quoted, of the endeavors of Osiris to
civilize the world, who would not imagine to be perusing the traditions
of the deeds of the culture heroes _Kukulean_[TN-28] and Quetzalcoatl of
the Mayas and of the Aztecs?Osiris was particularly worshiped at Philo,
where the history of his life is curiously illustrated in the sculptures
of a small retired chamber, lying nearly over the western adytum of the
temple, just as that of Chaacmol in the mural paintings of his funeral
chamber, the bas-reliefs of what once was his mausoleum, in those of the
queen's chamber and of her box in the tennis court at Chichen."The mysteries of Osiris were divided into the greater and less
     mysteries.Before admission into the former, it was necessary that
     the initiated should have passed through all the gradations of the
     latter.But to merit this great honor, much was expected of the
     candidate, and many even of the priesthood were unable to obtain
     it.Besides the proofs of a virtuous life, other recommendations
     were required, and to be admitted to all the grades of the higher
     mysteries was the greatest honor to which any one could aspire.It
     was from these that the mysteries of Eleusis were borrowed."In Mayab there also existed mysteries, as proved by symbols discovered
in the month of June last by myself in the monument generally called the
_Dwarf's House_, at Uxmal.It seemed that the initiated had to pass
through different gradations to reach the highest or third; if we are to
judge by the number of rooms dedicated to their performance, and the
disposition of said rooms.The strangest part, perhaps, of this
discovery is the information it gives us that certain signs and symbols
were used by the affiliated, that are perfectly identical to those used
among the masons in their symbolical lodges.I have lately published in
_Harper's Weekly_, a full description of the building, with plans of the
same, and drawings of the signs and symbols existing in it.These secret
societies exist still among the _Zunis_ and other Pueblo Indians of New
Mexico, according to the relations of Mr.Frank H. Cushing, a gentleman
sent by the Smithsonian Institution to investigate their customs and
history.In order to comply with the mission intrusted to him, Mr.Cushing has caused his adoption in the tribe of the Zunis, whose
language he has learned, whose habits he has adopted.Among the other
remarkable things he has discovered is "the existence of twelve sacred
orders, with their priests and their secret rites as carefully guarded
as the secrets of freemasonry, an institution to which these orders have
a strange resemblance."If from Egypt we pass to Nubia, we find that the peculiar battle ax of
the Mayas was also used by the warriors of that country; whilst many of
the customs of the inhabitants of equatorial Africa, as described by Mr.DuChaillu[TN-29] in the relation of his voyage to the "Land of Ashango,"
so closely resemble those of the aborigines of Yucatan as to suggest
that intimate relations must have existed, in very remote ages, between
their ancestors; if the admixture of African blood, clearly discernible
still, among the natives of certain districts of the peninsula, did not
place that _fact_ without the peradventure of a doubt.We also see
figures in the mural paintings, at Chichen, with strongly marked African
features.We learned by the discovery of the statue of Chaacmol, and that of the
priestess found by me at the foot of the altar in front of the shrine
of _Ix-cuina_, the Maya Venus, situated at the south end of _Isla
Mugeres_, it was customary with persons of high rank to file their teeth
in sharp points like a saw.We read in the chronicles that this fashion
still prevailed after the Spanish conquest; and then by little and
little fell into disuse.Travelers tells us that it is yet in vogue
among many of the tribes in the interior of South America; particularly
those whose names seem to connect with the ancient Caribs or Carians.Du Chaillu asserts that the Ashangos, those of Otamo, the Apossos, the
Fans, and many other tribes of equatorial Africa, consider it a mark of
beauty to file their front teeth in a sharp point.He presents the Fans
as confirmed cannibals.We are told, and the bas-reliefs on Chaacmol's
mausoleum prove it, that the Mayas devoured the hearts of their fallen
enemies.It is said that, on certain grand occasions, after offering the
hearts of their victims to the idols, they abandoned the bodies to the
people, who feasted upon them.But it must be noticed that these
last-mentioned customs seemed to have been introduced in the country by
the Nahualts and Aztecs; since, as yet, we have found nothing in the
mural paintings to cause us to believe that the Mayas indulged in such
barbaric repasts, beyond the eating of their enemies' hearts.The Mayas were, and their descendants are still, confirmed believers in
witchcraft.In December, last year, being at the hacienda of
X-Kanchacan, where are situated the ruins of the ancient city of
Mayapan, a sick man was brought to me.He came most reluctantly, stating
that he knew what was the matter with him: that he was doomed to die
unless the spell was removed.He was emaciated, seemed to suffer from
malarial fever, then prevalent in the place, and from the presence of
tapeworm.I told him I could restore him to health if he would heed my
advice.The fellow stared at me for some time, trying to find out,
probably, if I was a stronger wizard than the _H-Men_ who had bewitched
him.He must have failed to discover on my face the proverbial
distinctive marks great sorcerers are said to possess; for, with an
incredulous grin, stretching his thin lips tighter over his teeth, he
simply replied: "No use--I am bewitched--there is no remedy for me."Du Chaillu, speaking of the superstitions of the inhabitants of
Equatorial Africa, says: "The greatest curse of the whole country is the
belief in sorcery or witchcraft.If the African is once possessed with
the belief that he is bewitched his whole nature seems to change.He
becomes suspicious of his dearest friends.He fancies himself sick, and
really often becomes sick through his fears.At least seventy-five per
cent of the deaths in all the tribes are murders for supposed sorcery."In that they differ from the natives of Yucatan, who respect wizards
because of their supposed supernatural powers.From the most remote antiquity, as we learn from the writings of the
chroniclers, in all sacred ceremonies the Mayas used to make copious
libations with _Balche_.To-day the aborigines still use it in the
celebrations of their ancient rites._Balche_ is a liquor made from the
bark of a tree called Balche, soaked in water, mixed with honey and left
to ferment.The nectar drank by
the God of Greek Mythology.Du Chaillu, speaking of the recovery to health of the King of _Mayo_lo,
a city in which he resided for some time, says: "Next day he was so much
elated with the improvement in his health that he got tipsy on a
fermented beverage which he had prepared two days before he had fallen
ill, and which he made by _mixing honey and water, and adding to it
pieces of bark of a certain tree_."(Journey to Ashango Land, page 183.)I will remark here that, by a strange _coincidence_, we not only find
that the inhabitants of Equatorial Africa have customs identical with
the MAYAS, but that the name of one of their cities MAYO_lo_, seems to
be a corruption of MAYAB.The Africans make offerings upon the graves of their departed friends,
where they deposit furniture, dress and food--and sometimes slay slaves,
men and women, over the graves of kings and chieftains, with the belief
that their spirits join that of him in whose honor they have been
sacrificed.I have already said that it was customary with the Mayas to place in the
tombs part of the riches of the deceased and the implements of his trade
or profession; and that the great quantity of blood found scattered
round the slab on which the statue of Chaacmol is reclining would tend
to suggest that slaves were sacrificed at his funeral.The Mayas of old were wont to abandon the house where a person had died.Many still observe that same custom when they can afford to do so; for
they believe that the spirit of the departed hovers round it.The Africans also abandon their houses, remove even the site of their
villages when death frequently occur;[TN-30] for, say they, the place is
no longer good; and they fear the spirits of those recently deceased.Among the musical instruments used by the Mayas there were two kinds of
drums--the _Tunkul_ and the _Zacatan_.They are still used by the
aborigines in their religious festivals and dances.The _Tunkul_ is a cylinder hollowed from the trunk of a tree, so as to
leave it about one inch in thickness all round.It is generally about
four feet in length.On one side two slits are cut, so as to leave
between them a strip of about four inches in width, to within six inches
from the ends; this strip is divided in the middle, across, so as to
form, as it were, tongues.It is by striking on those tongues with two
balls of india-rubber, attached to the end of sticks, that the
instrument is played.The volume of sound produced is so great that it
can be heard, is[TN-31] is said, at a distance of six miles in calm
weather.The _Zacatan_ is another sort of drum, also hollowed from the
trunk of a tree.On one end a piece of
skin is tightly stretched.It is by beating on the skin with the hand,
the instrument being supported between the legs of the drummer, in a
slanting position, that it is played.Du Chaillu, Stanley and other travelers in Africa tell us that, in case
of danger and to call the clans together, the big war drum is beaten,
and is heard many miles around.Du Chaillu asserts having seen one of
these _Ngoma_, formed of a hollow log, nine feet long, at Apono; and
describes a _Fan_ drum which corresponds to the _Zacatan_ of the Mayas
as follows: "The cylinder was about four feet long and ten inches in
diameter at one end, but only seven at the other.The wood was hollowed
out quite thin, and the skin stretched over tightly.To beat it the
drummer held it slantingly between his legs, and with two sticks
beats[TN-32] furiously upon the upper, which was the larger end of the
cylinder."We have the counterpart of the fetish houses, containing the skulls of
the ancestors and some idol or other, seen by Du Chaillu, in African
towns, in the small huts constructed at the entrance of all the villages
in Yucatan.These huts or shrines contain invariably a crucifix; at
times the image of some saint, often a skull.The last probably to cause
the wayfarer to remember he has to die; and that, as he cannot carry
with him his worldly treasures on the other side of the grave, he had
better deposit some in the alms box firmly fastened at the foot of the
cross.Cogolludo informs us these little shrines were anciently
dedicated to the god of lovers, of histrions, of dancers, and an
infinity of small idols that were placed at the entrance of the
villages, roads and staircases of the temples and other parts.Even the breed of African dogs seems to be the same as that of the
native dogs of Yucatan.Were I to describe these I could not make use of
more appropriate words than the following of Du Chaillu: "The pure bred
native dog is small, has long straight ears, long muzzle and long curly
tail; the hair is short and the color yellowish; the pure breed being
known by the clearness of his color.They are always lean, and are kept
very short of food by their owners.* * * Although they have quick ears;
I don't think highly of their scent.I could continue this list of similes, but methinks those already
mentioned as sufficient for the present purpose.I will therefore close
it by mentioning this strange belief that Du Chaillu asserts exists
among the African warriors: "_The charmed leopard's skin worn about the
warrior's middle is supposed to render that worthy spear-proof._"

Let us now take a brief retrospective glance at the FACTS mentioned in
the foregoing pages.They seem to teach us that, in ages so remote as to
be well nigh lost in the abyss of the past, the _Mayas_ were a great and
powerful nation, whose people had reached a high degree of civilization.That it is impossible for us to form a correct idea of their
attainments, since only the most enduring monuments, built by them, have
reached us, resisting the disintegrating action of time and atmosphere.That, as the English of to-day, they had colonies all over the earth;
for we find their name, their traditions, their customs and their
language scattered in many distant countries, among whose inhabitants
they apparently exercised considerable civilizing influence, since they
gave names to their gods, to their tribes, to their cities.We cannot doubt that the colonists carried with them the old traditions
of the mother country, and the history of the founders of their
nationality; since we find them in the countries where they seem to have
established large settlements soon after leaving the land of their
birth.In course of time these traditions have become disfigured,
wrapped, as it were, in myths, creations of fanciful and untutored
imaginations, as in Hindostan: or devises of crafty priests, striving to
hide the truth from the ignorant mass of the people, fostering their
superstitions, in order to preserve unbounded and undisputed sway over
them, as in Egypt.In Hindostan, for example, we find the Maya custom of carrying the
children astride on the hips of the nurses.That of recording the vow of
the devotees, or of imploring the blessings of deity by the imprint of
the hand, dipped in red liquid, stamped on the walls of the shrines and
palaces.The worship of the mastodon, still extant in India, Siam,
Burmah, as in the worship of _Ganeza_, the god of knowledge, with an
elephant head, degenerated in that of the elephant itself.Still extant we find likewise the innate propensity of the Mayas to
exclude all foreigners from their country; even to put to death those
who enter their territories (as do, even to-day, those of Santa Cruz and
the inhabitants of the Tierra de Guerra) as the emissaries of Rama were
informed by the friend of the owner of the country, the widow of the
_great architect_, MAYA, whose name HEMA means in the Maya language "she
who places ropes across the roads to impede the passage."Even the
history of the death of her husband MAYA, killed with a thunderbolt, by
the god _Pourandara_, whose jealousy was aroused by his love for her and
their marriage, recalls that of _Chaacmol_, the husband of _Moo_, killed
by their brother Aac, by being stabbed by him three times in the back
with a spear, through jealousy--for he also loved _Moo_.Some Maya tribes, after a time, probably left their home at the South of
Hindostan and emigrated to Afghanistan, where their descendants still
live and have villages on the North banks of the river _Kabul_.They
left behind old traditions, that they may have considered as mere
fantasies of their poets, and other customs of their forefathers.Yet we
know so little about the ancient Afghans, or the Maya tribes living
among them, that it is impossible at present to say how much, if any,
they have preserved of the traditions of their race.All we know for a
certainty is that many of the names of their villages and tribes are
pure American-Maya words: that their types are very similar to the
features of the bearded men carved on the pillars of the castle, and on
the walls of other edifices at Chichen-Itza: while their warlike habits
recall those of the Mayas, who fought so bravely and tenaciously the
Spanish invaders.Some of the Maya tribes, traveling towards the west and northwest,
reached probably the shores of Ethiopia; while others, entering the
Persian Gulf, landed near the embouchure of the Euphrates, and founded
their primitive capital at a short distance from it.They called it _Hur
(Hula) city of guests just arrived_--and according to Berosus gave
themselves the name of _Khaldi_; probably because they intrenched their
city: _Kal_ meaning intrenchment in the American-Maya language.We have
seen that the names of all the principal deities of the primitive
Chaldeans had a natural etymology in that tongue.Such strange
coincidences cannot be said to be altogether accidental.Particularly
when we consider that their learned men were designated as MAGI, (Mayas)
and their Chief _Rab-Mag_, meaning, in Maya, the _old man_; and were
great architects, mathematicians and astronomers.As again we know of
them but imperfectly, we cannot tell what traditions they had preserved
of the birthplace of their forefathers.But by the inscriptions on the
tablets or bricks, found at Mugheir and Warka, we know for a certainty
that, in the archaic writings, they formed their characters of straight
lines of uniform thickness; and inclosed their sentences in squares or
parallelograms, as did the founders of the ruined cities of Yucatan.And
from the signet cylinder of King Urukh, that their mode of dressing was
identical with that of many personages represented in the mural
paintings at Chichen-Itza.We have traced the MAYAS again on the shores of Asia Minor, where the
CARIANS at last established themselves, after having spread terror among
the populations bordering on the Mediterranean.Their origin is unknown:
but their customs were so similar to those of the inhabitants of Yucatan
at the time even of the Spanish conquest--and their names CAR, _Carib_
or _Carians_, so extensively spread over the western continent, that we
might well surmise, that, navigators as they were, they came from those
parts of the world; particularly when we are told by the Greek poets and
historians, that the goddess MAIA was the daughter of _Atlantis_.We
have seen that the names of the khati, those of their cities, that of
Tyre, and finally that of Egypt, have their etymology in the Maya.Considering the numerous coincidences already pointed out, and many more
I could bring forth, between the attainments and customs of the Mayas
and the Egyptians; in view also of the fact that the priests and learned
men of Egypt constantly pointed toward the WEST as the birthplace of
their ancestors, it would seem as if a colony, starting from Mayab, had
emigrated Eastward, and settled on the banks of the Nile; just as the
Chinese to-day, quitting their native land and traveling toward the
rising sun, establish themselves in America.In Egypt again, as in Hindostan, we find the history of the children of
CAN, preserved among the secret traditions treasured up by the priests
in the dark recesses of their temples: the same story, even with all its
details.It is TYPHO who kills his brother OSIRIS, the husband of their
sister ISIS.Some of the names only have been changed when the members
of the royal family of CAN, the founder of the cities of Mayab, reaching
apotheosis, were presented to the people as gods, to be worshiped.That the story of _Isis_ and _Osiris_ is a mythical account of CHAACMOL
and MOO, from all the circumstances connected with it, according to the
relations of the priests of Egypt that tally so closely with what we
learn in Chichen-Itza from the bas-reliefs, it seems impossible to
doubt.Effectively, _Osiris_ and _Isis_ are considered as king and queen of the
Amenti--the region of the West--the mansion of the dead, of the
ancestors.Whatever may be the etymology of the name of Osiris, it is a
_fact_, that in the sculptures he is often represented with a spotted
skin suspended near him, and Diodorus Siculus says: "That the skin is
usually represented without the head; but some instances where this is
introduced show it to be the _leopard's_ or _panther's_."Again, the
name of Osiris as king of the West, of the Amenti, is always written, in
hieroglyphic characters, representing a crouching _leopard_ with an eye
above it.It is also well known that the priests of Osiris wore a
_leopard_ skin as their ceremonial dress.Now, Chaacmol reigned with his sister Moo, at Chichen-Itza, in Mayab, in
the land of the West for Egypt.The name _Chaacmol_ means, in Maya, a
_Spotted_ tiger, a _leopard_; and he is represented as such in all his
totems in the sculptures on the monuments; his shield being made of the
skin of leopard, as seen in the mural paintings.Osiris, in Egypt, is a myth.Chaacmol, in Mayab, a reality.A warrior
whose mausoleum I have opened; whose weapons and ornaments of jade are
in Mrs.Le Plongeon's possession; whose heart I have found, and sent a
piece of it to be analysed by professor Thompson of Worcester, Mass.;
whose effigy, with his name inscribed on the tablets occupying the place
of the ears, forms now one of the most precious relics in the National
Museum of Mexico.As to the etymology of her name
the Maya affords it in I[C]IN--_the younger sister_.As Queen of the
Amenti, of the West, she also is represented in hieroglyphs by the same
characters as her husband--a _leopard, with an eye above_, and the sign
of the feminine gender an oval or egg.But as a goddess she is always
portrayed with wings; the vulture being dedicated to her; and, as it
were, her totem.MOO the wife and sister of _Chaacmol_ was the Queen of Chichen.She is
represented on the Mausoleum of Chaacmol as a _Macaw_ (Moo in the Maya
language); also on the monuments at Uxmal: and the chroniclers tell us
that she was worshiped in Izamal under the name of _Kinich-Kakmo_;
reading from right to left the _fiery macaw with eyes like the sun_.Their protecting spirit is a _Serpent_, the totem of their father CAN.Another Egyptian divinity, _Apap_ or _Apop_, is represented under the
form of a gigantic serpent covered with wounds.Plutarch in his
treatise, _De Iside et Osiride_, tells us that he was enemy to the sun.TYPHO was the brother of Osiris and Isis; for jealousy, and to usurp the
throne, he formed a conspiration and killed his brother.He is said to
represent in the Egyptian mythology, the sea, by some; by others, _the
sun_.AAK (turtle) was also the brother of Chaacmol and _Moo_.For jealousy,
and to usurp the throne, he killed his brother at treason with three
thrusts of his _spear_ in the back.Around the belt of his statue at
Uxmal used to be seen hanging the heads of his brothers CAY and
CHAACMOL, together with that of MOO; whilst his feet rested on their
flayed bodies.In the sculpture he is pictured surrounded by the _Sun_
as his protecting spirit.The escutcheon of Uxmal shows that he called
the place he governed the land of the Sun.In the bas-reliefs of the
Queen's chamber at Chichen his followers are seen to render homage to
the _Sun_; others, the friends of MOO, to the _Serpent_.So, in Mayab as
in Egypt, the _Sun_ and _Serpent_ were inimical.In Egypt again this
enmity was a myth, in Mayab a reality.AROERIS was the brother of Osiris, Isis and Typho.His business seems to
have been that of a peace-maker.CAY was also the brother of _Chaacmol_, _Moo_ and _Aac_.He was the high
pontiff, and sided with Chaacmol and Moo in their troubles, as we learn
from the mural paintings, from his head and flayed body serving as
trophy to Aac as I have just said.In June last, among the ruins of _Uxmal_, I discovered a magnificent
bust of this personage; and I believe I know the place where his remains
are concealed.NEPHTHIS was the sister of Isis, Osiris, Typho, and Aroeris, and the
wife of Typho; but being in love with Osiris she managed to be taken to
his embraces, and she became pregnant.That intrigue having been
discovered by Isis, she adopted the child that Nephthis, fearing the
anger of her husband, had hidden, brought him up as her own under the
name of Anubis.Nephthis was also called NIKE by some.NIC or NICTE was the sister of _Chaacmol_, _Moo_, _Aac_, and _Cay_, with
whose name I find always her name associated in the sculptures on the
monuments.Here the analogy between these personages would seem to
differ, still further study of the inscriptions may yet prove the
Egyptian version to contain some truth._Nic_ or _Nicte_[TN-33] means
flower; a cast of her face, with a flower sculptured on one cheek,
exists among my collections.We are told that three children were born to Isis and Osiris: Horus,
Macedo, and Harpocrates.Well, in the scene painted on the walls of
Chaacmol's funeral chamber, in which the body of this warrior is
represented stretched on the ground, cut open under the ribs for the
extraction of the heart and visceras, he is seen surrounded by his wife,
his sister NIC, his mother _Zo[c]_, and four children.I will close these similes by mentioning that _Thoth_ was reputed the
preceptor of Isis; and said to be the inventor of letters, of the art of
reckoning, geometry, astronomy, and is represented in the hieroglyphs
under the form of a baboon (cynocephalus).He is one of the most ancient
divinities among the Egyptians.He had also the office of scribe in the
lower regions, where he was engaged in noting down the actions of the
dead, and presenting or reading them to Osiris.One of the modes of
writing his name in hieroglyphs, transcribed in our common letters,
reads _Nukta_; a word most appropriate and suggestive of his attributes,
since, according to the Maya language, it would signify to understand,
to perceive, _Nuctah_: while his name Thoth, maya[TN-34] _thot_ means to
scatter flowers; hence knowledge.In the temple of death at Uxmal, at
the foot of the grand staircase that led to the sanctuary, at the top of
which I found a sacrificial altar, there were six cynocephali in a
sitting posture, as Thoth is represented by the Egyptians.They were
placed three in a row each side of the stairs.Between them was a
platform where a skeleton, in a kneeling posture, used to be.To-day the
cynocephali have been removed.They are in one of the yard[TN-35] of the
principal house at the Hacienda of Uxmal.The statue representing the
kneeling skeleton lays, much defaced, where it stood when that ancient
city was in its glory.In the mural paintings at Chichen-Itza, we again find the baboon
(Cynocephalus) warning Moo of impending danger.She is pictured in her
home, which is situated in the midst of a garden, and over which is seen
the royal insignia.A basket, painted blue, full of bright oranges, is
symbolical of her domestic happiness.Before
her is an individual pictured physically deformed, to show the ugliness
of his character and by the flatness of his skull, want of moral
qualities, (the[TN-36] proving that the learned men of Mayab understood
phrenology).He is in an persuasive attitude; for he has come to try to
seduce her in the name of another.She rejects his offer: and, with her
extended hand, protects the armadillo, on whose shell the high priest
read her destiny when yet a child.In a tree, just above the head of the
man, is an ape.His hand is open and outstretched, both in a warning and
threatening position.A serpent (_can_), her protecting spirit, is seen
at a short distance coiled, ready to spring in her defense.Near by is
another serpent, entwined round the trunk of a tree.He has wounded
about the head another animal, that, with its mouth open, its tongue
protruding, looks at its enemy over its shoulder.Blood is seen oozing
from its tongue and face.This picture forcibly recalls to the mind the
myth of the garden of Eden.For here we have the garden, the fruit, the
woman, the tempter.As to the charmed _leopard_ skin worn by the African warriors to render
them invulnerable to spears, it would seem as if the manner in which
Chaacmol met his death, by being stabbed with a spear, had been known
to their ancestors; and that they, in their superstitious fancies, had
imagined that by wearing his totem, it would save them from being
wounded with the same kind of weapon used in killing him.Let us not
laugh at such a singular conceit among uncivilized tribes, for it still
prevails in Europe.On many of the French and German soldiers, killed
during the last German war, were found talismans composed of strips of
paper, parchment or cloth, on which were written supposed cabalistic
words or the name of some saint, that the wearer firmly believed to be
possessed of the power of making him invulnerable.I am acquainted with many people--and not ignorant--who believe that by
wearing on their persons rosaries, made in Jerusalem and blessed by the
Pope, they enjoy immunity from thunderbolts, plagues, epidemics and
other misfortunes to which human flesh is heir.That the Mayas were a race autochthon on this western continent and did
not receive their civilization from Asia or Africa, seems a rational
conclusion, to be deduced from the foregoing FACTS.If we had nothing
but their _name_ to prove it, it should be sufficient, since its
etymology is only to be found in the American Maya language.They cannot be said to have been natives of Hindostan; since we are told
that, in very remote ages, _Maya_, a prince of the Davanas, established
himself there.We do not find the etymology of his name in any book
where mention is made of it.We are merely told that he was a wise
magician, a great architect, a learned astronomer, a powerful Asoura
(demon), thirsting for battles and bloodshed: or, according to the
Sanscrit, a Goddess, the mother of all beings that exist--gods and men.Very little is known of the Mayas of Afghanistan, except that they call
themselves _Mayas_, and that the names of their tribes and cities are
words belonging to the American Maya language.Who can give the etymology of the name _Magi_, the learned men amongst
the Chaldees.We only know that its meaning is the same as _Maya_ in
Hindostan: magician, astronomer, learned man.If we come to Greece,
where we find again the name _Maia_, it is mentioned as that of a
goddess, as in Hindostan, the mother of the gods: only we are told that
she was the daughter of Atlantis--born of Atlantis.But if we come to
the lands beyond the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, then we find a
country called MAYAB, on account of the porosity of its soil; that, as a
sieve (_Mayab_), absorbs the water in an incredibly short time.Its
inhabitants took its name from that of the country, and called
themselves _Mayas_.It is a fact worthy of notice, that in their
hieroglyphic writings the sign employed by the Egyptians to signify a
_Lord_, a _Master_, was the image of a sieve.Would not this seem to
indicate that the western invaders who subdued the primitive inhabitants
of the valley of the Nile, and became the lords and masters of the land,
were people from MAYAB; particularly if we consider that the usual
character used to write the name of Egypt was the sieve, together with
the sign of land?We know that the _Mayas_ deified and paid divine honors to their eminent
men and women after their death.This worship of their heroes they
undoubtedly carried, with other customs, to the countries where they
emigrated; and, in due course of time, established it among their
inhabitants, who came to forget that MAYAB was a locality, converted it
in to a personalty: and as some of their gods came from it, Maya was
considered as the _Mother of the Gods_, as we see in Hindostan and
Greece.It would seem probable that the Mayas did not receive their civilization
from the inhabitants of the Asiatic peninsulas, for the religious lores
and customs they have in common are too few to justify this assertion.They would simply tend to prove that relations had existed between them
at some epoch or other; and had interchanged some of their habits and
beliefs as it happens, between the civilized nations of our days.This
appears to be the true side of the question; for in the figures
sculptured on the obelisks of Copan the Asiatic type is plainly
discernible; whilst the features of the statues that adorn the
celebrated temples of Hindostan are, beyond all doubts, American.The FACTS gathered from the monuments do not sustain the theory advanced
by many, that the inhabitants of tropical America received their
civilization from Egypt and Asia Minor.It is true that
I have shown that many of the customs and attainments of the Egyptians
were identical to those of the Mayas; but these had many religious rites
and habits unknown to the Egyptians; who, as we know, always pointed
towards the West as the birthplaces of their ancestors, and worshiped as
gods and goddesses personages who had lived, and whose remains are still
in MAYAB.Besides, the monuments themselves prove the respective
antiquity of the two nations.According to the best authorities the most ancient monuments raised by
the Egyptians do not date further back than about 2,500 years B. C.
Well, in Ake, a city about twenty-five miles from Merida, there exists
still a monument sustaining thirty-six columns of _katuns_.Each of
these columns indicate a lapse of one hundred and sixty years in the
life of the nation.They then would show that 5,760 years has intervened
between the time when the first stone was placed on the east corner of
the uppermost of the three immense superposed platforms that compose the
structure, and the placing of the last capping stone on the top of the
thirty-sixth column.How long did that event occur before the Spanish
conquest it is impossible to surmise.Supposing, however, it did take
place at that time; this would give us a lapse of at least 6,100 years
since, among the rejoicings of the people this sacred monument being
finished, the first stone that was to serve as record of the age of the
nation, was laid by the high priest, where we see it to-day.I will
remark that the name AKE is one of the Egyptians' divinities, the third
person of the triad of Esneh; always represented as a child, holding his
finger to his mouth.To-day the meaning of the
word is lost in Yucatan.Cogolludo, in his history of Yucatan, speaking of the manner in which
they computed time, says:

"They counted their ages and eras, which they inscribed in their books
every twenty years, in lustrums of four years.* * * When five of these
lustrums were completed, they called the lapse of twenty years _katun_,
which means to place a stone down upon another.* * * In certain sacred
buildings and in the houses of the priests every twenty years they place
a hewn stone upon those already there.When seven of these stones have
thus been piled one over the other began the _Ahau katun_.Then after
the first lustrum of four years they placed a small stone on the top of
the big one, commencing at the east corner; then after four years more
they placed another small stone on the west corner; then the next at the
north; and the fourth at the south.At the end of the twenty years they
put a big stone on the top of the small ones: and the column, thus
finished, indicated a lapse of one hundred and sixty years."There are other methods for determining the approximate age of the
monuments of Mayab:

1st.By means of their actual orientation; starting from the _fact_ that
their builders always placed either the faces or angles of the edifices
fronting the cardinal points.By determining the epoch when the mastodon became extinct.For,
since _Can_ or his ancestors adopted the head of that animal as symbol
of deity, it is evident they must have known it; hence, must have been
contemporary with it.By determining when, through some great cataclysm, the lands became
separated, and all communications between the inhabitants of _Mayab_ and
their colonies were consequently interrupted.If we are to credit what
Psenophis and Sonchis, priests of Heliopolis and Sais, said to Solon
"that nine thousand years before, the visit to them of the Athenian
legislator, in consequence of great earthquakes and inundations, the
lands of the West disappeared in one day and a fatal night," then we may
be able to form an idea of the antiquity of the ruined cities of America
and their builders.Reader, I have brought before you, without comments, some of the FACTS,
that after ten years of research, the paintings on the walls of
_Chaacmol's_ funeral chamber, the sculptured inscriptions carved on the
stones of the crumbling monuments of Yucatan, and a comparative study of
the vernacular of the aborigines of that country, have revealed to us.Many years of further patient investigations,
the full interpretation of the monumental inscriptions, and, above all,
the possession of the libraries of the learned men of _Mayab_, are the
_sine qua non_ to form an uncontrovertible one, free from the
speculations which invalidate all books published on the subject
heretofore.If by reading these pages you have learned something new, your time has
not been lost; nor mine in writing them.Transcriber's Note

line was broken, and the enemy routed.Custer, with the whole division,
now pressed through the gap pell-mell, in hot pursuit, halting for neither
prisoners nor guns, until the road to Lynchburg, crowded with wagons and
artillery, was in our possession.We then turned short to the right and
headed for the Appomattox Court House; but just before reaching it we
discovered the thousands of camp fires of the rebel army, and the pursuit
was checked.The enemy had gone into camp, in fancied security that his
route to Lynchburg was still open before him; and he little dreamed that
our cavalry had planted itself directly across his path, until some of our
men dashed into Appomattox Court House, where, unfortunately, Lieutenant
Colonel Root, of the Fifteenth New York Cavalry, was instantly killed by a
picket guard.After we had seized the road, we were joined by other
divisions of the cavalry corps which came to our assistance, but too late
to take part in the fight.Owing to the night attack, our regiments were so mixed up that it took
hours to reorganize them.When this was effected, we marched near to the
railroad station and bivouacked.We threw ourselves on the ground
to rest, but not to sleep.We knew that the infantry was hastening to our
assistance, but unless they joined us before sunrise, our cavalry line
would be brushed away, and the rebels would escape after all our hard work
to head them off from Lynchburg.About daybreak I was aroused by loud
hurrahs, and was told that Ord's corps was coming up rapidly, and forming
in rear of our cavalry.Soon after we were in the saddle and moving
towards the Appomattox Court House road, where the firing was growing
lively; but suddenly our direction was changed, and the whole cavalry
corps rode at a gallop to the right of our line, passing between the
position of the rebels and the rapidly forming masses of our infantry, who
greeted us with cheers and shouts of joy as we galloped along their front.At several places we had to "run the gauntlet" of fire from the enemy's
guns posted around the Court House, but this only added to the interest
of the scene, for we felt it to be the last expiring effort of the enemy
to put on a bold front; we knew that we had them this time, and that at
last Lee's proud army of Northern Virginia was at our mercy.While moving
at almost a charging gait we were suddenly brought to a halt by reports of
a surrender.General Sheridan and his staff rode up, and left in hot haste
for the Court House; but just after leaving us, they were fired into by a
party of rebel cavalry, who also opened fire on us, to which we promptly
replied, and soon put them to flight.Our lines were then formed for a
charge on the rebel infantry; but while the bugles were sounding the
charge, an officer with a white flag rode out from the rebel lines, and we
halted.It was fortunate for us that we halted when we did, for had we
charged we would have been swept into eternity, as directly in our front
was a creek, on the other side of which was a rebel brigade, entrenched,
with batteries in position, the guns double shotted with canister.To have
charged this formidable array, mounted, would have resulted in almost
total annihilation.After we had halted, we were informed that
preliminaries were being arranged for the surrender of Lee's whole army.At this news, cheer after cheer rent the air for a few moments, when soon
all became as quiet as if nothing unusual had occurred.I rode forward
between the lines with Custer and Pennington, and met several old friends
among the rebels, who came out to see us.Among them, I remember Lee
(Gimlet), of Virginia, and Cowan, of North Carolina.I saw General Cadmus
Wilcox just across the creek, walking to and fro with his eyes on the
ground, just as was his wont when he was instructor at West Point.I
called to him, but he paid no attention, except to glance at me in a
hostile manner.While we were thus discussing the probable terms of the surrender, General
Lee, in full uniform, accompanied by one of his staff, and General
Babcock, of General Grant's staff, rode from the Court House towards our
lines.As he passed us, we all raised our caps in salute, which he
gracefully returned.Later in the day loud and continuous cheering was heard among the rebels,
which was taken up and echoed by our lines until the air was rent with
cheers, when all as suddenly subsided.The surrender was a fixed fact, and
the rebels were overjoyed at the very liberal terms they had received.Our
men, without arms, approached the rebel lines, and divided their rations
with the half-starved foe, and engaged in quiet, friendly conversation.There was no bluster nor braggadocia,--nothing but quiet contentment that
the rebellion was crushed, and the war ended.In fact, many of the rebels
seemed as much pleased as we were.Now and then one would meet a surly,
dissatisfied look; but, as a general thing, we met smiling faces and hands
eager and ready to grasp our own, especially if they contained anything to
eat or drink.After the surrender, I rode over to the Court House with
Colonel Pennington and others and visited the house in which the surrender
had taken place, in search of some memento of the occasion.We found that
everything had been appropriated before our arrival.Wilmer McLean, in
whose house the surrender took place, informed us that on his farm at
Manassas the first battle of Bull Run was fought.I asked him to write his
name in my diary, for which, much to his surprise.Others did the same, and I was told that he thus received quite a golden
harvest.While all of the regiments of the division shared largely in the glories
of these two days, none excelled the Second New York Cavalry in its record
of great and glorious deeds.Well might its officers and men carry their
heads high, and feel elated with pride as they received the
congratulations and commendations showered on them from all sides.They

      Was tall in stature and advanced in years,
    And leading long a solitary life
      Oft grieved her, even to the fall of tears.At length a neighbor, bachelor, and old,
      But not too old to match the Lady B----,
    Feeling his life monotonous and cold,
      Proposed to her that they should wedded be.Proposed, and was accepted--need we say?Even the wedding-day and dress were named;
    And gossips' tongues had conn'd the matter o'er--
      Some praised the union, others strongly blamed.The Lady B----, whose features were my _first_,
      Was well endowed with beauties that are rare,
    Well read, well spoken--had, indeed, a mind
      With which few of the sex called tender can compare.But the old bachelor had all the ways
      Of one grown fidgety in solitude;
    And he at once in matters not his own
      Began unseemly and untimely to intrude.What is the difference between a cloud and a whipped child?One pours
with rain, the other roars with pain!Because the worse people are the

    My ancestors lived centuries before I gained my form.I always lived by sucking, I ne'er ate any bread,
    I wasn't good for anything till after I was dead.They bang'd and they whang'd me, they turned me outside in,
    They threw away my body, saved nothing but my skin.When I grew old and crazy--was quite worn out and thin,
    They tore me all to pieces, and made me up again.And then I traveled up and down the country for a teacher,
    To some of those who saw me, I was good as any preacher.Why is a jeweler like a screeching florid singer?Because he pierces
the ears for the sake of ornament!What sort of music should a girl sing whose voice is cracked and

indifferent singer?Because it's often terribly bawled (bald)!What is better than an indifferent singer in a drawing-room after
dinner?Why is a school-mistress like the letter C?If an egg were found on a music-stool, what poem of Sir Walter Scott's
would it remind you of?Why would an owl be offended at your calling him a pheasant?Because

sagacious pointer with him; this noble quadrupedal, and occasionally
graminiverous specimen, went not before, went not behind, nor on one
side of him; then where did the horrid brute go?Why, on the other side
of him, of course.My _first_, a messenger of gladness;
    My _last_, an instrument of sadness;

    That wretch's frenzy and his pain were o'er.Why is a bad hat like a fierce snarling pup dog?Because it snaps (its

miss givings.Why is a hunted fox like a Puseyite?Because he's a tracked-hairy-un
(tractarian).Why did Du Chaillu get so angry when he was quizzed about the gorilla?What's the difference between the cook at an eating-house and Du
Chaillu?One lives by the gridiron, the other by the g'riller.Why is the last conundrum like a monkey?Because it is far fetched and
full of nonsense.My first, loud chattering, through the air,
      Bounded'mid tree-tops high,
    Then saw his image mirror'd, where
      My second murmured by.Taking it for a friend, he strayed
      T'wards where the stream did roll,
    And was the sort of fool that's made
      The first day of my whole.What grows the less tired the more it works?Which would you rather, look a greater fool than you are, or be a
greater fool than you look?Let a person choose, then say, "That's
impossible."She was--we have every reason to
believe--Maid of Orleans!Which would you rather, that a lion ate you or a tiger?Why, you would
rather that the lion ate the tiger, of course!When he moves from one spot to
another!I paint without colors, I fly without wings,
    I people the air with most fanciful things;
    I hear sweetest music where no sound is heard,
    And eloquence moves me, nor utters a word.The past and the present together I bring,
    The distant and near gather under my wing.Far swifter than lightning my wonderful flight,
    Through the sunshine of day, or the darkness of night;
    And those who would find me, must find me, indeed,
    As this picture they scan, and this poesy read.A pudding-bag is a pudding-bag, and a pudding-bag has what everything
else has; what is it?Why was it, as an old woman in a scarlet cloak was crossing a field in
which a goat was browsing, that a most wonderful metamorphosis took
place?Because the goat turned to butter (butt her), and the antique
party to a scarlet runner!What is the most wonderful animal in the farm-yard?A pig, because he
is killed and then cured!Why does a stingy German like mutton better than venison?Because he
prefers "zat vich is sheep to zat vich is deer."'Twas winter, and some merry boys
      To their comrades beckoned,
    And forth they ran with laughing tongues,
      And much enjoyed my _second_.And as the sport was followed up,
      There rose a gladsome burst,
    When lucklessly amid their group
      One fell upon my _first_.There is with those of larger growth
      A winter of the soul,
    And when _they_ fall, too oft, alas!Why has the beast that carries the Queen of Siam's palanquin nothing
whatever to do with the subject?What did the seven wise men of Greece do when they met the sage of

Hercules?The one that is--Nessus-hairy!To be said to your _inamorata_, your lady love: What's the difference
between Jupiter and your very humble servant?Jupiter liked nectar and
ambrosia; I like to be next yer and embrace yer!Because she got a little
prophet (profit) from the rushes on the bank.Because its turning is the
result of conviction.What is the difference between a wealthy toper and a skillful miner?One turns his gold into quarts, the other turns his quartz into gold!Why is a mad bull an animal of convivial disposition?Because he offers
a horn to every one he meets.Why is a drunkard hesitating to sign the pledge like a skeptical

    I am with thee, child of man;
    With thee still from first to last,
    In pain and pleasure, feast and fast,
    At thy cradle and thy death,
    Thine earliest wail and dying breath,

    On the earth or in the grave;
    The worm and I, the worm and I,

      (Well suited to the season)
    Had been well served, and well enjoyed--
      Of course I mean in reason.And then a game of merry sort
      My _second_ made full many do;
    One player, nimbler than the rest,
      Caught sometimes one and sometimes two.She was a merry, laughing wench,
      And to the sport gave life and soul;
    Though maiden dames, and older folk,
      Declared her manners were my _whole_."It's a vane thing to
aspire."Give the positive, comparative, and superlative degrees of the

    the other turns his quartz into gold?When it's (s)ticking there.The
remaining member of the party was Montecute Mattison.He was a small
man, with peevishly pinched features, that wore an incipient smirk when
in repose, and a hyena snarl when in action.He had no friends and no
intimates.He was the sort who played dirty golf in a match:
deliberately moving on the green, casting his shadow across the hole,
talking when his opponent was about to drive, and anything else to
disconcert.In fact, he was a dirty player in any game--because it was
natural.He would not have been tolerated a moment, even at the
Heights, if he had not been Warwick Mattison's son, and the heir to his
millions.He never made an honest dollar in his life, and could not, if
he tried, but he was Assistant-Treasurer of his father's company, did
an hour's work every day signing the checks, and drew fifteen thousand
a year for it.A man's constant inclination was to smash him in the
face--and the only reason he escaped was because it would have been
like beating a child.One man had, when Mattison was more than
ordinarily offensive, laid him across his knee, and, in full sight of
the Club-house, administered a good old-fashioned spanking with a golf
club.The others did not take the
trouble, however.They simply shrugged their shoulders, and swore at
him freely and to his face.At present, he was playing the devoted to Miss Brundage and hence his
inclusion in the party.She cared nothing for him, but his money was a
thing to be considered--having very little of her own--and she was
doing her best to overcome her repugnance sufficiently to place him
among the eligibles.Mattison got through the dinner without any exhibition of ill nature,
but, when the women retired, it came promptly to the fore.The talk had turned on the subject of the Club Horse Show.It was
scheduled for the following month, and was quite the event of the
Autumn, in both a social and an equine sense.The women showed their
gowns and hosiery, the men their horses and equipment, and how
appropriately they could rig themselves out--while the general herd
stood around the ring gaping and envious.Presently, there came a momentary lull in the conversation and Mattison
remarked:

"I see Royster & Axtell went up to-day.I reckon," with an insinuating
laugh, "there will be some entries withdrawn.""Both--and men who haven't horses, as well," with a sneering glance at
Croyden."I am not responsible for the direction of Mr.Mattison's eyes,"
Croyden answered with assumed good nature."I knew, of course, you were hit,
but I hoped it was only for a small amount.""If you haven't any
appreciation of propriety, you can at least keep quiet.""Oh, I don't know----"

"Don't you?"said Colloden, quietly, reaching across and grasping him
by the collar."Think again,--_and think quickly_!"A sickly grin, half of surprise and half of anger, overspread
Mattison's face."Can't you take a little pleasantry?""We don't like your pleasantries any more than we like you, and that is
not at all.He shook him, much as
a terrier does a rat, and jammed him back into his chair."Now, either
be good or go home," he admonished.Mattison was weak with anger--so angry, indeed, that he was helpless
either to stir or to make a sound.The others ignored him--and, when he
was a little recovered, he got up and went slowly from the room."It wasn't a particularly well bred thing to do," observed Colloden,
"but just the same it was mighty pleasant.If it were not for the law,
I'd have broken his neck.""He isn't worth the exertion, Roderick," Croyden remarked."But I'm
obliged, old man.When they rejoined the ladies on the piazza, a little later, Mattison
had gone.After a while, the others went off in their motors, leaving Croyden
alone with Miss Cavendish.Hungerford had offered to drop him at the
Club, but he had declined.He would enjoy himself a little
longer--would give himself the satisfaction of another hour with her,
before he passed into outer darkness.He had gone along in his easy, bachelor way, without a serious thought
for any woman, until six months ago.Then, Elaine Cavendish came home,
after three years spent in out-of-the-way corners of the globe, and,
straightway, bound him to her chariot wheels.At least, so the women said--who make it their particular business to
observe--and they never make mistakes.They can tell when one is
preparing to fall in love, long before he knows himself.Indeed, there
have been many men drawn into matrimony, against their own express
inclination, merely by the accumulation of initiative engendered by
impertinent meddlers.They want none of it, they even fight desperately
against it, but, in the end, they succumb.And Geoffrey Croyden would have eventually succumbed, of his own
desires, however, had Elaine Cavendish been less wealthy, and had his
affairs been more at ease.Now, he thanked high Heaven he had not
offered himself.She might have accepted him; and think of all the
heart-burnings and pain that would now ensue, before he went out of her
life!"What were you men doing to Montecute Mattison?""He appeared perfectly furious when he came out, and he went off
without a word to anyone--even Charlotte Brundage was ignored.""He and Colloden had a little difficulty--and Mattison left us,"
Croyden answered."Didn't he stop to say good-night?""He called something as he drove off--but I think
he was swearing at his man.""He needed something to swear at, I fancy!""Took him by the collar and shook him--and told him either to go home
or be quiet.""Yes--when he had recovered himself sufficiently.I thought, at first,
his anger was going to choke him.""Imagine big, good-natured Roderick stirred sufficiently to lay hands
on any one!""But imagine him _when_ stirred," he said."I hadn't thought of him in that way," she said, slowly--"Ough!"with a
little shiver, "it must have been terrifying--what had Mattison done to
him?""Nothing--Mattison is too much of a coward ever to _do_ anything.""Oh, some brutality about one of Colloden's friends, I think," Croyden
evaded."I didn't quite hear it--and we didn't discuss it afterward.""I'm told he is a scurrilous little beast, with the men," she
commented; "but, I must say, he is always polite to me, and reasonably
charitable.Indeed, to-night is the only deliberately bad manners he
has ever exhibited.""He knows the men won't hurt him," said Croyden, "whereas the women, if
he showed his ill nature to them, would promptly ostracize him.He is
a canny bounder, all right.""We have had
enough of Mattison--let us find something more interesting--yourself, for
instance."Which reminds
me--Miss Southard is coming to-morrow; you will be over, of course?""I'm going East to-morrow night," he said."But she is to stay two weeks--you will be back before she leaves,
won't you?""I fear not--I may go on to London.""I've been anticipating it for some time," sending a cloud of cigarette
smoke before his face."But it grew imminent only to-day."When the smoke faded, her eyes were looking questioningly into his.There was something in his words that did not ring quite true.It was
too sudden to be genuine, too unexpected.It struck her as vague and
insincere.Yet there was no occasion to mistrust--it was common enough
for men to be called suddenly to England on business.----

"When do you expect to return?""I do not know," he said, reading something that was in her mind."If I
must go, the business which takes me will also fix my return."Pride's Crossing wishes to talk with
you."Croyden arose--it was better to make the farewell brief--and
accompanied her to the doorway."Good-bye," he said, simply."Yes--there are some things that must be done to-night.""Good-bye, then--and _bon voyage_," she said, extending her hand.He took it--hesitated just an instant--lifted it to his lips--and,
then, without a word, swung around and went out into the night.*       *       *       *       *

The next day--at noon--when, her breakfast finished, she came down
stairs, a scare headline in the morning's paper, lying in the hall, met
her eyes.Royster Found Dead in His Bath-room!ROYSTER & AXTELL FAIL!Many Prominent Persons Among the Creditors.She seized the paper, and nervously ran her eyes down the columns until
they reached the list of those involved.----

Yes!And Croyden read it, too, as he sped Eastward toward the unknown life.III

CLARENDON


Croyden left Northumberland in the morning--and his economy began with
the ride East: he went on Day Express instead of on the Limited,
thereby saving the extra fare.At Philadelphia he sent his baggage to
the Bellevue-Stratford; later in the evening, he had it returned to the
station, and checked it, himself, to Hampton--to avoid the possibility
of being followed by means of his luggage.He did not imagine that any one would go to the trouble to trace him,
but he was not taking any chances.He wanted to cut himself away,
utterly, from his former life, to be free of everyone he had ever
known.Some one would say: "I haven't seen Croyden lately," would be answered:
"I think he went abroad suddenly--about the time of the Royster &
Axtell failure," and, with that, he would pass out of notice.If he
were to return, any time within the next five years, he would be met by
a languid: "Been away, somewhere, haven't you?I thought I hadn't
noticed you around the Club, lately."--And that would be the extent of
it.His going and his coming are not
watched.There is no time to bother with another's affairs.Everyone
has enough to do to look after his own.The curiosity about one's
neighbors--what he wears, what he eats, what he does, every item in his
daily life--that is developed by idleness, thrives in littleness, and
grows to perfection in scandal and innuendo--belongs solely to the
small town.If one comes down street with a grip--instantly: So and so
is "going away"--speculation as to why?--where?--what?One puts on a
new suit, it is observed and noted.--A pair of new shoes, ditto.--A new
necktie, ditto.Every particular of his life is public property, is
inspected for a motive, and, if a motive cannot be discovered, one is
supplied--usually mean and little, the latter unctuously preferred.All this Croyden was yet to learn, however.He took the night's express on the N. Y., P.& N., whence, at Hampton
Junction, he transferred to a branch line.For twenty miles the train
seemed to crawl along, burrowing into the sand hills and out again into
sand, and in and out again, until, at length, with much whistling and
escaping steam, they wheezed into the station and stopped.There were a dozen white men, with slouch hats and nondescript
clothing, standing aimlessly around, a few score of <DW64>s, and a
couple of antique carriages with horses to match.The white men looked
at the new arrival, listlessly, and the <DW64>s with no interest at
all--save the two who were porters for the rival hotels.They both made
for Croyden and endeavored to take his grip."I don't want your hotel, boys," he said."But if you can tell me where
Clarendon is, I will be obliged."yass, seh," said one, "right out at de een' o' de
village, seh--dis street tek's yo dyar, seh, sho nuf.""Dis een', seh, de fust house beyon' Majah Bo'den's, seh.""'Tain't no blocks--it's jest de fust
place beyon' Majah Bo'den's.""Here," he said, "you take my bag out to
Clarendon--I'll walk till I find it."but yo bettah ride, seh!"said Croyden, looking at the vehicle.He tossed the <DW64> a quarter and turned away."Thankee, seh, thankee, seh, I'll brings it right out, seh."Croyden went slowly down the street, while the crowd stared after him,
and the shops emptied their loafers to join them in the staring.He was
a strange man--and a well-dressed man--and they all were curious.Presently, the shops were replaced by dwellings of the humbler sort,
then they, in turn, by more pretentious residences--with here and there
a new one of the Queen Anne type.Croyden did not need the information,
later vouchsafed, that they belong to _new_ people.It was as
unmistakable as the houses themselves.About a mile from the station, he passed a place built of English
brick, covered on the sides by vines, and shaded by huge trees.It
stood well back from the street and had about it an air of aristocracy
and exclusiveness."I wonder if this is the Bordens'?"said Croyden looking about him for
some one to ask--"Ah!"Down the path from the house was coming a young woman.He slowed down,
so as to allow her to reach the entrance gates ahead of him.She was
pretty, he saw, as she neared--very pretty!--positively beautiful!dark
hair and----

He took off his hat."Yes--this is Major Borden's," she answered, with a deliciously soft
intonation, which instantly stirred Croyden's Southern blood."Then Clarendon is the next place, is it not?"She gave him the quickest glance of interest, as she replied in the
affirmative."Colonel Duval is dead, however," she added--"a caretaker is the only
person there, now."There was no excuse for detaining her longer.he ended, bowed slightly, and went on.It is ill bred and rude to stare back at a woman, but, if ever Croyden
had been tempted, it was now.He heard her footsteps growing fainter in
the distance, as he continued slowly on his way.Something behind him
seemed to twitch at his head, and his neck was positively stiff with
the exertion necessary to keep it straight to the fore.He wanted another look at that charming figure, with the mass of blue
black hair above it, and the slender silken ankles and slim tan-shod
feet below.He remembered that her eyes were blue, and that they met
him through long lashes, in a languidly alluring glance; that she was
fair; and that her mouth was generous, with lips full but delicate--a
face, withal, that clung in his memory, and that he proposed to see
again--and soon.He walked on, so intent on his visual image, he did not notice that the
Borden place was behind him now, and he was passing the avenue that led
into Clarendon.hyar yo is, marster!--hyar's Clarendon," called the <DW64>,
hastening up behind him with his bag.Croyden turned into the walk--the black followed."Cun'l Duval's done been daid dis many a day, seh," he said."Folks sez
ez how it's owned by some city fellah, now.Mebbe yo knows 'im, seh?"Croyden did not answer, he was looking at the place--and the <DW64>,
with an inquisitively curious eye, relapsed into silence.The house was very similar to the Bordens'--unpretentious, except for
the respectability that goes with apparent age, vine clad and tree
shaded.It was of generous proportions, without being large--with a
central hall, and rooms on either side, that rose to two stories, and
was topped by a pitch-roof.There were no piazzas at front or side,
just a small stoop at the doorway, from which paths branched around to
the rear."I done'speck, seh, yo go roun' to de back," said the <DW64>, as
Croyden put his foot on the step."Ole Mose 'im live dyar.I'll bring
'im heah, ef yo wait, seh.""Who is old Mose--the caretaker?"The place was looked after by a real estate man of the village, and
neither his father nor he had bothered to do more than meet the
accounts for funds.The former had preferred to let it remain
unoccupied, so as to have it ready for instant use, if he so wished,
and Croyden had done the same.Mose he's Cun'l Duval's body-survent, seh.Him an'
Jos'phine--Jos'phine he wif', seh--dey looks arfter de place sence de
ole Cun'l died."They followed the right hand path, which seemed to be more used than
its fellow.The servants' quarters were disclosed at the far end of the
lot.Before the tidiest of them, an old <DW64> was sitting on a stool,
dreaming in the sun.At Croyden's appearance, he got up hastily, and
came forward--gray-haired, and bent.he said, with the remains of what once must have been a
wonderfully graceful bow, and taking in the stranger's attire with a
single glance.Cun'l Duval's boy--seh, an' I looks
arfter de place, now.De Cun'l he's daid, yo knows, seh.What can I do
fur yo, seh?"the <DW54> answered, inquiringly.It was evident the name conveyed no meaning to him."I'm the new owner, you know--since Colonel Duval died," Croyden
explained.So yo's de new marster, is yo?I'm
pow'ful glad yo's come, seh!What mout yo name be, seh?""Now, Moses, will you open the house and
let me in?""Coz why, seh--I'm beggin' yo pa'den, seh, but Marster Dick sez, sez
he, 'Don' nuvver lets no buddy in de house, widout a writin' from me.'I ain' doubtin' yo, seh, 'deed I ain', but I ruther hed de writin'.""You're perfectly right," Croyden answered."Here, boy!--do you know
Mr.Well, go down and tell him that Mr.Croyden is at Clarendon,
and ask him to come out at once.Or, stay, I'll give you a note to
him."He took a card from his pocketbook, wrote a few lines on it, and gave
it to the <DW64>.said the porter, and, dropping the grip where
he stood, he vanished.Old Mose dusted the stool with his sleeve, and proffered it."I'll lie here," he answered, stretching himself out on the grass."You
were Colonel Duval's body-servant, you say."from de time I wuz so 'igh.I don''member when I warn' he
body-survent.I follows 'im all th'oo de war, seh, an' I wus wid 'im
when he died."Tears were in the <DW54>'s eyes."Hit's purty nigh time
ole Mose gwine too.""And when he died, you stayed and looked after the old place.That was
the right thing to do," said Croyden."Didn't Colonel Duval have any
children?"De Cun'l nuvver married, cuz Miss Penelope----"

He caught himself."I toles yo 'bout hit some time, seh, mebbe!"he
ended cautiously--talking about family matters with strangers was not
to be considered."I should like to hear some time," said Croyden, not seeming to notice
the <DW54>'s reticence."Eight years ago cum corn plantin' time, seh.He jes' wen' right off
quick like, when de mis'ry hit 'im in de chist--numonya, de doctors
call'd it.De Cun'l guv de place to a No'thern gent'man, whar was he
'ticular frien', and I done stay on an' look arfter hit.yo's de gent'mans, mebbe.""I am his son," said Croyden, amused."An' yo owns Cla'endon, now, seh?What yo goin' to do wid it?""Goin' to live heah!--yo means it, seh?"the <DW54> asked, in great
amazement."Provided you will stay with me--and if you can find me
a cook.Didn' Jos'phine cook fur de Cun'l all he
life--Jos'phine, she my wife, seh--she jest gone nex' do', 'bout
some'n."He got up--"I calls her, seh.""Never mind," he said; "she will be back, presently, and there is ample
time.De udder <DW65>s done gone 'way, sence de
Cun'l died, coz deah war nothin' fur dem to do no mo', an' no buddy to
pays dem.--Dyar is Jos'phine, now, sir, she be hear torectly.An' heah
comes Marster Dick, hisself."Croyden arose and went toward the front of the house to meet him.The agent was an elderly man; he wore a black broadcloth suit, shiny at
the elbows and shoulder blades, a stiff white shirt, a wide roomy
collar, bound around by a black string tie, and a broad-brimmed
drab-felt hat.His greeting was as to one he had known all his life."I'm delighted to make your
acquaintance, sir."He drew out a key and opened the front door."Welcome to Clarendon, sir, welcome!Let us hope you will like it
enough to spend a little time here, occasionally.""I'm sure I too hope so," returned Croyden; "for I am thinking of
making it my home.""It's
convenient to Baltimore; and Philadelphia, and New York, and Washington
aren't very far away.Exactly what the city people who can afford it,
are doing now,--making their homes in the country.Hampton's a town,
but it's country to you, sir, when compared to Northumberland--open the
shutters, Mose, so we can see.... This is the library, with the
dining-room behind it, sir--and on the other side of the hall is the
drawing-room.Open it, Mose, we will be over there presently.You see,
sir, it is just as Colonel Duval left it.Your father gave instructions
that nothing should be changed.He was a great friend of the Colonel,
was he not, sir?""I believe he was," said Croyden."They met at the White Sulphur, where
both spent their summers--many years before the Colonel died.""There, hangs the Colonel's sword--he carried it through the war,
sir--and his pistols--and his silk-sash, and here, in the corner, is
one of his regimental guidons--and here his portrait in
uniform--handsome man, wasn't he?And as gallant and good as he was
handsome.Maryland lost a brave son, when he died, sir.""He looks the soldier," Croyden remarked."And he was one, sir--none better rode behind Jeb Stuart--and never far
behind, sir, never far behind!"Seventh Maryland Cavalry--he commanded it during the last
two years of the war--went in a lieutenant and came out its colonel.A
fine record, sir, a fine record!Pity it is, he had none to leave it
to!--he was the last of his line, you know, the last of the line--not
even a distant cousin to inherit."Croyden looked up at the tall, slender man in Confederate gray, with
clean-cut aristocratic features, wavy hair, and long, drooping
mustache.What a figure he must have been at the head of his command,
or leading a charge across the level, while the guns of the Federals
belched smoke, and flame and leaden death."They offered him a brigade," the agent was saying, "but he declined
it, preferring to remain with his regiment.""What did he do when the war was over?""Came home, sir, and resumed his law practice.Like his great leader,
he accepted the decision as final.He didn't spend the balance of his
life living in the past."Surely, such a man" (with a wave of his
hand toward the portrait) "could have picked almost where he chose!""No one ever just knew, sir--it had to do with Miss Borden,--the sister
of Major Borden, sir, who lives on the next place.They were
sweethearts once, but something or somebody came between them--and
thereafter, the Colonel never seemed to think of love.Perhaps, old
Mose knows it, and if he comes to like you, sir, he may tell you the
story.You understand, sir, that Colonel Duval is Mose's old master,
and that every one stands or falls, in his opinion, according as they
measure up to him.I hope you intend to keep him, sir--he has been a
faithful caretaker, and there is still good service in him--and his
wife was the Colonel's cook, so she must have been competent.She would
never cook for anyone, after he died.She thought she belonged to
Clarendon, sort of went with the place, you understand.Just stayed and
helped Mose take care of it.She doubtless will resume charge of the
kitchen again, without a word.It's the way of the old <DW64>s, sir.The young ones are pretty worthless--they've got impudent, and
independent and won't work, except when they're out of money.Excuse
me, I ramble on----"

"I'm much interested," said Croyden; "as I expect to live here, I must
learn the ways of the people.""Well, let Mose boss the <DW65>s for you, at first; he understands
them, he'll make them stand around.Come over to the drawing-room, sir,
I want you to see the furniture, and the family portraits.... There,
sir, is a set of twelve genuine Hepplewhite chairs--no doubt about it,
for the invoice is among the Colonel's papers.I don't know much about
such things, but a man was through here, about a year ago, and, would
you believe it, when he saw the original invoice and looked at the
chairs, he offered me two thousand dollars for them.Of course, as I
had been directed by your father to keep everything as the Colonel had
it, I just laughed at him.You see, sir, they have the three feathers,
and are beautifully carved, otherwise.And, here, is a lowboy, with the
shell and the fluted columns, and the cabriole legs, carved on the
knees, and the claw and ball feet.And this sofa, with the lion's claw and the eagle's wing, he wanted
to buy it, too.In fact, sir, he wanted to buy about everything in the
house--including the portraits.There are two by Peale and one by
Stuart--here are the Peales, sir--the lady in white, and the young
officer in Continental uniform; and this is the Stuart--the gentleman
in knee breeches and velvet coat.I think he is the same as the one in
uniform, only later in life.They are the Colonel's grandparents, sir:
Major Daniel Duval, of the Tenth Maryland Line, and his wife; she was a
Miss Paca--you know the family, of course, sir.The Major's commission,
sir, hangs in the hall, between the Colonel's own and his father's--he
was an officer in the Mexican war, sir.It was a fighting family, sir,
a fighting family--and a gentle one as well.'The bravest are the
tenderest, the loving are the daring.'"There was enough of the South Carolinian of the Lowlands in Croyden,
to appreciate the Past and to honor it.He might not know much
concerning Hepplewhite nor the beauty of his lines and carving, and he
might be wofully ignorant of his own ancestors, having been bred in a
State far removed from their nativity, for he had never given a thought
to the old things, whether of furniture or of forebears--they were of
the inanimate; his world had to do only with the living and what was
incidental to it.The Eternal Now was the Fetich and the God of
Northumberland, all it knew and all it lived for--and he, with every
one else, had worshipped at its shrine.and the spirit of his long dead
mother, with her heritage of aristocratic lineage, called to him,
stirring him strangely, and his appreciation, that was sleeping and not
dead, came slowly back to life.The men in buff-and-blue, in
small-clothes, in gray, the old commissions, the savour of the past
that clung around them, were working their due.For no man of culture
and refinement--nay, indeed, if he have but their veneer--can stand in
the presence of an honorable past, of ancestors distinguished and
respected, whether they be his or another's, and be unmoved."And you say there are none to inherit all these things?""Didn't the original Duval leave children?""There was but one son to each generation,
sir--and with the Colonel there was none.""Then, having succeeded to them by right of purchase, and with no
better right outstanding, it falls to me to see that they are not
shamed by the new owner.Their portraits shall remain undisturbed
either by collectors or by myself.Moreover, I'll look up my own
ancestors.I've got some, down in South Carolina and up in
Massachusetts, and if their portraits be in existence, I'll add
reproductions to keep the Duvals company.Ancestors by inheritance and
ancestors by purchase.The two of them ought to keep me straight, don't
you think?"IV

PARMENTER'S BEQUEST


Croyden, with Dick as guide and old Mose as forerunner and
shutter-opener, went through the house, even unto the garret.As in the downstairs, he found it immaculate.Josephine had kept
everything as though the Colonel himself were in presence.The bed
linen, the coverlids, the quilts, the blankets were packed in trunks,
the table-linen and china in drawers and closets.None of them was
new--practically the entire furnishing antedated 1830, and much of them
1800--except that, here and there, a few old rugs of oriental weaves,
relieved the bareness of the hardwood floors.The one concession to modernism was a bath-room, but its tin tub and
painted iron wash-stand, with the plumbing concealed by wainscoting,
proclaimed it, alas, of relatively ancient date.And, for a moment,
Croyden contrasted it with the shower, the porcelain, and the tile, of
his Northumberland quarters, and shivered, ever so slightly.It would
be the hardest to get used to, he thought.As yet, he did not know the
isolation of the long, interminably long, winter evenings, with
absolutely nothing to do and no place to go--and no one who could
understand.At length, when they were ready to retrace their steps to the lower
floor, old Mose had disappeared."Gone to tell his wife that the new master has come," said Dick."Let
us go out to the kitchen."And there they found her--bustling around, making the fire, her head
tied up in a bandana, her sleeves rolled to the shoulders.She turned,
as they entered, and dropped them an old-fashioned curtsy.Can you
cook for him, as well as you did for Colonel Duval?""Survent, marster," she said to Croyden, with another curtsy--then, to
the agent, "Kin I cooks, Marster Dick!Sut'n'y, I kin.Don' yo t'inks dis <DW65>'s forgot--jest yo waits, Marster Croyden, I
shows yo, seh, sho' nuf--jest gives me a little time to get my han' in,
seh.""You won't need much time," Dick commented."The Colonel considered her
very satisfactory, sir, very satisfactory, indeed.And he was a
competent judge, sir, a very competent judge.""Oh, we'll get along," said Croyden, with a smile at Josephine."If you
could please Colonel Duval, you will more than please me.""Have you had any experience with <DW64> servants?"Dick asked, as they
returned to the library."No," Croyden responded: "I have always lived at a Club.""Well, Mose and his wife are of the old times--you can trust them,
thoroughly, but there is one thing you'll have to remember, sir: they
are nothing but overgrown children, and you'll have to discipline them
accordingly.They don't know what it is to be impertinent, sir; they
have their faults, but they are always respectful.""Can I rely on them to do the buying?""I think so, sir, the Colonel did, I know.If you wish, I'll send you a
list of the various stores, and all you need do is to pay the bills.Is
there anything else I can do now, sir?""And thank you very much for all you have
done.""How about your baggage--can I send it out?No trouble, sir, I assure
you, no trouble.I'll just give your checks to the drayman, as I pass.By the way, sir, you'll want the telephone in, of course.And you needn't fear to speak to your neighbors;
they will take it as it's meant, sir.The next on the left is Major
Borden's, and this, on the right, is Captain Tilghman's, and across the
way is Captain Lashiel's, and Captain Carrington's, and the house
yonder, with the huge oaks in front, is Major Markoe's.""Sort of a military settlement," smiled Croyden."Yes, sir--some of them earned their title in the war, and some of
them in the militia and some just inherited it from their pas.Sort of
handed down in the family, sir.The men will call on you, promptly,
too.I shouldn't wonder some of them will be over this evening."Croyden thought instantly of the girl he had seen coming out of the
Borden place, and who had directed him to Clarendon."Would it be safe to speak to the good-looking girls, too--those who
are my neighbors?""Certainly, sir; if you tell them your name--and don't try to flirt
with them," Dick added, with a laugh."Yonder is one, now--Miss
Carrington," nodding toward the far side of the street.the girl of the blue-black hair and
slender silken ankles."She's Captain Carrington's granddaughter," Dick went on with the
Southerner's love for the definite in genealogy."Her father and mother
both died when she was a little tot, sir, and they--that is, the
grandparents, sir--raised her.That's the Carrington place she's
turning in at.Ah----"

The girl glanced across and, recognizing Dick (and, it must be
admitted, her Clarendon inquirer as well), nodded.But Croyden noticed that the older man
could teach him much in the way it should be done.He did it shortly,
sharply, in the city way; Dick, slowly, deferentially, as though it
were an especial privilege to uncover to her."Are there more like her, in Hampton?""I'm too old, sir, to be a competent judge," returned Dick, "but I
should say we have several who trot in the same class.I mean,
sir----"

"I understand!""It's no disrespect in a Marylander, I
take it, when he compares the ladies with his race-horses."At least, that's the way we of the older generation
feel; our ladies and our horses run pretty close together.But that spirit
is fast disappearing, sir!The younger ones are becoming--commercialized,
if you please.It's dollars first, and _then_ the ladies, with them--and
the horses nowhere.Though I don't say it's not wise.Horses and the
war have almost broken us, sir.We lost the dollars, or forgot about
them and they lost themselves, whichever way it was, sir.It's right that
our sons should start on a new track and run the course in their own
way--Yes, sir," suddenly recollecting himself, "Miss Carrington's a
pretty girl, and so's Miss Tayloe and Miss Lashiel and a heap more.Indeed, sir, Hampton is famed on the Eastern Sho' for her women.I'll
attend to your baggage, and the telephone, sir, and if there is
anything else I can do, pray command me.Drop in and see me when you
get up town.And removing his hat with a bow
just a little less deferential than the one he had given to Miss
Carrington, he proceeded up the street, leisurely and deliberately, as
though the world were waiting for him."The man who,
according to our way of thinking, is the acme of hustle and bustle and
business, and schemes to trap the unwary.Truly, the Eastern Shore has
much to learn--or we have much to unlearn!Well, I have tried the
one--and failed.Now, I'm going to try the other.It seems to promise a
quiet life, at least."He turned, to find Moses in the doorway, waiting."Marster Croyden," he said, "shall I puts yo satchel an' things in de
Cun'l's room, seh?"He did not know which was the Colonel's room, but it
was likely to be the best in the house, and, moreover, it was well to
follow him wherever he could."And see that my luggage is taken there, when the man brings it," he
directed--"and tell Josephine to have luncheon at one and dinner at
seven.""De Cun'l hed dinner in de middle o' de day, seh," he said, as though
Croyden had inadvertently erred.And Croyden appreciating the situation, answered:

"Well, you see, Moses, I've been used to the other way and I reckon you
will have to change to suit me."Lunch is de same as supper, I
s'pose, seh?""Yes," he said, "that will answer--like a light supper.""There may be an objection, after all, to taking over Colonel Duval's
old servants," he reflected."It may be difficult to persuade them that
he is no longer the master.I run the chance of being ruled by a dead
man."Presently his luggage arrived, and he went upstairs to unpack.Moses
looked, in wonder, at the wardrobe trunk, with every suit on a separate
hanger, the drawers for shirts and linen, the apartments for hats, and
collars, and neckties, and the shoes standing neatly in a row below."Whar's de use atak'in de things out t'al, Marster Croyden!"I mo'nt a kno'd hit.Hit's mons'us strange, seh, whar yo mon't
a' kno'd ef yo'd only stop to t'ink.F' instance, I mon't a kno'd yo'd
cum back to Clarendon, seh, some day, cuz yo spends yo money on hit."Dyar's dinner--I means lunch, seh," said Moses."And I'm ready for it," said Croyden, as he went to the iron
wash-stand, and then slowly down stairs to the dining-room.From some place, Moses had resurrected a white coat, yellow with its
ten years' rest, and was waiting to receive him.He drew out Croyden's
chair, as only a family servant of the olden times can do it, and bowed
him into his place.The table was set exactly as in Colonel Duval's day, and very prettily
set, Croyden thought, with napery spotless, and china that was thin and
fine.The latter, if he had but known it, was Lowestoft and had served
the Duvals, on that very table, for much more than a hundred years.There was cold ham, and cold chicken, lettuce with mayonnaise, deviled
eggs, preserves, with hot corn bread and tea.When Croyden had about
finished a leisurely meal, it suddenly occurred to him that however
completely stocked Clarendon was with things of the Past, they did not
apply to the larder, and _these_ victuals were undoubtedly fresh and
particularly good.Moses," he said, "I'm glad you were thoughtful enough to
send out and purchase these things," with an indicating motion to the
table."Dese things not pu'chased.Dey's borro'd, seh, from Majah Bo'den's, yass, seh!""You don't mean you borrowed my
luncheon!"Jose jes' went ovah an' sez to Cassie--she's
de cook, at de Majah's, seh--sez she, Marster Croyden don' cum and
warns some'n to eat.An' she got hit, yass, seh!""Is it the usual thing, here, to borrow an entire meal from the
neighbor's?""Sut'n'y, seh!We borrows anything we needs from the neighbors, an'
they does de same wid us.""Well, I don't want any borrowing by _us_, Moses, please remember,"
said Croyden, emphatically."The neighbors can borrow anything we have,
and welcome, but we won't claim the favor from them, you understand?"said the old <DW54>, wonderingly.Such a situation as one kitchen not borrowing from another was
incomprehensible.It had been done by the servants from time
immemorial--and, though Croyden might forbid, yet Josephine would
continue to do it, just the same--only, less openly."And see that everything is returned not later than to-morrow," Croyden
continued.I tote's dem back dis minut, seh!----"

"What?""Dese things, heah, whar yo didn' eat, seh----"

"Do you mean--Oh, Lord!""Sut'n'y, seh," returned the <DW54>."Dat's what I wuz gwine do in de
fust place."The ways they had,
were the ways that would hold them.He might protest, and order
otherwise, until doomsday, but it would not avail.For them, it was
sufficient if Colonel Duval permitted it, or if it were the custom."I think I shall let the servants manage me," he thought."They know
the ways, down here, and, besides, it's the line of least resistance."He went into the library, and, settling himself in a comfortable chair,
lit a cigarette.... It was the world turned upside down.Less than
twenty-four hours ago it was money and madness, bankruptcy and divorce
courts, the automobile pace--the devil's own.Now, it was quiet and
gentility, easy-living and refinement.Had he been in Hampton a little
longer, he would have added: gossip and tittle-tattle, small-mindedness
and silly vanity.He wondered what
Elaine Cavendish had done last evening--if she had dined at the
Club-house, and what gown she had worn, if she had played golf in the
afternoon, or tennis, and with whom; he wondered what she would do this
evening--wondered if she thought of him more than casually.Then he wondered again: who had his old quarters at
the Heights?He knew a number who would be jumping for them--who had
his old table for breakfast?it, too, would be eagerly sought--who
would take his place on the tennis and the golf teams?--what Macloud
was doing?the only man in Northumberland he
would trust, the only man in Northumberland, likely, who would care a
rap whether he came back or whether he didn't, or who would ever give
him a second thought.He wondered if Gaspard, his particular waiter,
missed him?yes, he would miss the tips, at least; yes, and the boy who
brushed his clothes and drew his bath would miss him, and his caddie,
as well.Every one whom he _paid_, would miss him....

He threw away his cigarette and sat up sharply.An old mahogany slant-top escritoire, in the corner by the window,
caught his eye.It had a shell, inlaid in maple, in the front, and the
parquetry, also, ran around the edges of the drawers and up the sides.There was one like it in the Cavendish library, he remembered.He went
over to it, and, the key being in the lock, drew out pulls and turned
back the top.Inside, there was the usual lot of pigeon holes and small
drawers, with compartments for deeds and larger papers.Either Colonel Duval, in anticipation of death, had cleaned it out, or
Moses and Josephine, for their better preservation, had packed the
contents away.He was glad of it; he could use it, at least, without
ejecting the Colonel.He closed the lid and had turned away, when the secret drawer, which,
sometimes, was in these old desks, occurred to him.He went back and
began to search for it.... And, presently, he found it.Under the
middle drawer was a sliding panel that rolled back, when he pressed on
a carved lion's head ornamentation, and which concealed a hidden
recess.It was yellow with age, and, when Croyden took it in his fingers, he
caught the faint odor of sandal wood.It was brittle in the creases,
and threatened to fall apart.So, opening it gently, he spread it on
the desk before him.Here is what he read:

                                     "Annapolis, 10 May, 1738."Honoured Sir:

  "I fear that I am about to Clear for my Last Voyage--the old
  wounds trouble me, more and more, especially those in my head and
  chest.I am confined to my bed, and though Doctor Waldron does
  not say it, I know he thinks I am bound for Davy Jones' locker.So be it--I've lived to a reasonable Age, and had a fair Time in
  the living.I've done that which isn't according to Laws, either
  of Man or God--but for the Former, I was not Caught, and for the
  Latter, I'm willing to chance him in death.When you were last
  in Annapolis, I intended to mention a Matter to you, but
  something prevented, I know not what, and you got Away ere I was
  aware of it.Now, fearing lest I Die before you come again, I
  will Write it, though it is against the Doctor's orders--which,
  however, I obey only when it pleases me."You are familiar with certain Episodes in my Early Life, spent
  under the Jolly Roger on the Spanish Main, and you have
  maintained Silence--for which I shall always be your debtor.You
  have, moreover, always been my Friend, and for that, I am more
  than your debtor.It is, therefore, but Mete that you should be
  my Heir--and I have this day Executed my last Will and Testament,
  bequeathing to you all my Property and effects.Dulany, the Attorney, who wrote it, to be probated in due
  Season."But there still remains a goodly portion which, for obvious
  reasons, may not be so disposed of.I
  buried it in September, 1720, shortly after I came to Annapolis,
  trusting not to keep so great an Amount in my House.It amounts
  to about half my Fortune, and Approximates near to Fifty Thousand
  Pounds, though that may be but a crude Estimate at best, for I am
  not skilled in the judging of Precious Stones.Where I obtained
  this wealth, I need not mention, though you can likely guess.And
  as there is nothing by which it can be identified, you can use it
  without Hesitation.Subject, however, to one Restriction: As it
  was not honestly come by (according to the World's estimate,
  because, forsooth, I only risked my Life in the gathering,
  instead of pilfering it from my Fellow man in Business, which is
  the accepted fashion) I ask you not to use it except in an
  Extremity of Need.If that need does not arise in your Life, you,
  in turn, may pass this letter on to your heir, and he, in turn,
  to his heir, and so on, until such Time as the Need may come, and
  the Restriction be lifted.And now to find the Treasure:--

  "Seven hundred and fifty feet--and at right angles to the water
  line--from the extreme tip of Greenberry Point, below Annapolis,
  where the Severn runs into the Chesapeake, are four large Beech
  trees, standing as of the corners of a Square, though not
  equidistant.Bisect this Square, by two lines drawn from the
  Corners.At a Point three hundred and thirty feet,
  North-by-North-East, from where these two lines intersect and at
  a depth of Six feet, you will come upon an Iron Box.And I wish you (or whoever recovers it) Joy of
  it!--as much joy with it as I had in the Gathering."Lest I die before you come again to Annapolis, I shall leave
  this letter with Mr.Dulany, to be delivered to you on the First
  Occasion.I judge him as one who will respect a Dead man's seal.If I see you not again, Farewell.I am, sir, with great
  respect,

                          "Y'r humb'l & obed't Serv'nt

                                            "Robert Parmenter."To Marmaduke Duval, Esq'r."Below was written, by another hand:

  "The Extremity of Need has not arisen, I pass it on to my son.And below that, by still another hand:

  "Neither has the Need come to me.And below that, by still another hand:

  "Nor to me.And below that:

  "The Extremity of Need brushed by me so close I heard the
  rustling of its gown, but I did not dig.I have sufficient for
  me, and I am the last of my line.I pass it, therefore, to my
  good friend Hugh Croyden (and, in the event that he predecease
  me, to his son Geoffrey Croyden), to whom Clarendon will go upon
  my demise.Croyden read the last endorsement again; then he smiled, and the smile
broadened into an audible laugh.Well, at least, it promised something to engage
him, if time hung heavily on his hands.The Duvals seem to have taken
the bequest seriously--so, why not he?And, though the extremity of
need seems never to have reached them, it was peculiar that none of the
family had inspected the locality and satisfied himself of the accuracy
of the description.The extreme tip of Greenberry Point had shifted, a
dozen times, likely, in a hundred and ninety years, and the four beech
trees had long since disappeared, but there was no note of these facts
to aid the search.He must start just where Robert Parmenter had left
off: with the letter.He found an old history of Maryland in the book-case.Annapolis was somewhere on the Western Shore, he knew.He ran his
eyes down the Chesapeake.Yes, here it was--with Greenberry Point just
across the Severn.So much of the letter was accurate, at least.Some time soon he would go across, and
take a look over the ground.Greenberry Point, for all he knew, might
be built up with houses, or blown half a mile inland, or turned into a
fort, or anything.It was not likely to have remained the same, as in
Parmenter's day; and, yet, if it had changed, why should not the Duvals
have remarked it, in making their endorsements.He put the letter back in the secret compartment, where it had rested
for so many years.Evidently, Colonel Duval had forgotten it, in his
last brief illness.Would it
help him to the treasure as well?For with him, the restriction was
lifted--the extremity of need was come.Moreover, it was time that the
letter should be put to the test.V

MISS CARRINGTON


Croyden was sitting before the house, later in the afternoon, when an
elderly gentleman, returning leisurely from town, turned in at the
Clarendon gates."My first caller," thought Croyden, and immediately he arose and went
forward to meet him."Permit me to present myself, sir," said the newcomer."I am very glad to meet you, Captain Carrington," said Croyden, taking
the proffered hand."This is your first visit to Hampton, I believe, sir," the Captain
remarked, when they were seated under the trees."It is not
Northumberland, sir; we haven't the push, and the bustle, and the
smoke, but we have a pleasant little town, sir, and we're glad to
welcome you here.It's a long time since
Clarendon had a tenant, sir.Colonel Duval's been dead nearly ten years
now.Your father and he were particular friends, I believe."Croyden assured him that such was the case."Yes, sir, the Colonel often spoke of him to me with great affection.I
can't say I was surprised to know that he had made him his heir.He was
the last of the Duvals--not even a collateral in the family--there was
only one child to a generation, sir."Manifestly, it was not known in Hampton how Hugh Croyden came to be the
Colonel's heir, and, indeed, friendship had prompted the money-loan,
without security other than the promise of the ultimate transfer of
Clarendon and its contents.And Croyden, respecting the Colonel's wish,
evident now, though unexpressed either to his father or himself,
resolved to treat the place as a gift, and to suppress the fact that
there had been an ample and adequate consideration.After a short visit, Captain Carrington arose to go."Come over and take supper with us, this evening, sir," said he."I'll come with pleasure," Croyden answered, thinking of the girl with
the blue-black hair and slender ankles."It's the house yonder, with the white pillars--at half-after-six,
then, sir."*       *       *       *       *

As Croyden approached the Carrington house, he encountered Miss
Carrington on the walk."We have met before," she said, as he bowed over her hand."I was your
original guide to Clarendon."But you wanted to hear me say it?""I wanted to know if you could say it," she answered, gayly."Shall I put your name on the list--at the foot?""The last comer--you have to work your way up by merit, you know.""_That_ you will have to discover.""No, it should not be so difficult--for you," she answered, with a
flash of her violet eyes.as they reached the piazza--"let me
present Mr.Carrington arose to greet him--a tall, slender woman, whose age
was sixty, at least, but who appeared not a day over forty-five,
despite the dark gown and little lace cap she was wearing.She seemed
what the girl had called her--the mother, rather than the grandmother."You play Bridge, of course, Mr.Croyden," said Miss Carrington, when
the dessert was being served."I like it very much," he answered."I was sure you did--so sure, indeed, I asked a few friends in
later--for a rubber or two--and to meet you.""So it's well for me I play," he smiled.Carrington--"that is, if you care aught
for Davila's good opinion.If one can't play Bridge one would better
not be born.""When you know Mother a little better, Mr.Croyden, you will recognize
that she is inclined to exaggerate at times," said Miss Carrington."I
admit that I am fond of the game, that I like to play with people who
know how, and who, at the critical moment, are not always throwing the
wrong card--you understand?""In other words, you haven't any patience with stupidity," said
Croyden."Nor have I--but we sometimes forget that a card player is
born, not made.All the drilling and teaching one can do won't give
card sense to one who hasn't any."Miss Carrington exclaimed, "and life is too short to
bother with such people.They may be very charming otherwise, but not
across the Bridge table.""Yet ought you not to forgive them their misplays, just because they
are charming?""If you were given your choice
between a poor player who is charming, and a good player who is
disagreeable, which would you choose, Mr.Croyden?--Come, now be
honest.""It would depend upon the size of the game," Croyden responded."If it
were half a cent a point, I should choose the charming partner, but if
it were five cents or better, I am inclined to think I should prefer
the good player.""I'll remember that," said Miss Carrington."As we don't play, here,
for money stakes, you won't care if your partner isn't very expert.""The stipulation is that she shall be
charming.I should be willing to take _you_ for a partner though you
trumped my ace and forgot my lead.""_Merci_, _Monsieur_," she answered."Though you know I should do
neither."We'll go down to the Club, some evening.We old fellows aren't
much on Bridge, but we can handle a pair or three of-a-kind, pretty
good."You must not let the Captain beguile you," interposed Mrs."The men all play poker with us,--it is a heritage of the old
days--though the youngsters are breaking away from it.""And it is just as
well--we have sense enough to stop before we're broke, but they
haven't.""To hear father talk, you would think that the present generation is no
earthly good!""Yet I suppose, when he was
young, his elders held the same opinion of him.""The old ones always think the young
ones have a lot to learn--and they have, sir, they have!But it's of
another sort than we can teach them, I reckon.""We'll smoke on the piazza, sir--the ladies don't object."As they passed out, a visitor was just ascending the steps.Miss
Carrington gave a smothered exclamation and went forward."How do you do, Miss Erskine!"returned Miss Erskine, "and Mrs.Carrington--and the dear Captain, too.--I'm charmed to find you all at
home."She spoke with an affected drawl that would have been amusing in a
handsome woman, but was absurdly ridiculous in one with her figure and
unattractive face.She turned expectantly toward Croyden, and Miss Carrington presented
him."So this is the new owner of Clarendon," she gurgled with an 'a' so
broad it impeded her speech."You have kept us waiting a long time, Mr."I'm afraid you will find me a very husky myth," Croyden answered."'Husky' is scarcely the correct word, Mr.Croyden; _animated_ would be
better, I think.We scholars, you know, do not like to hear a word used
in a perverted sense."She waddled to a chair and settled into it.Croyden shot an amused
glance toward Miss Carrington, and received one in reply."No, I suppose not," he said, amiably."But, then, you know, I am not a
scholar."Miss Erskine smiled in a superior sort of way."Very few of us are properly careful of our mode of speech," she
answered.Croyden, I hope you intend to open Clarendon,
so as to afford those of us who care for such things, the pleasure of
studying the pictures, and the china, and the furniture.I am told it
contains a Stuart and a Peale--and they should not be hidden from those
who can appreciate them.""I assume you're talking of pictures," said Croyden."I am, sir,--most assuredly!""Well, I must confess ignorance, again," he replied."I wouldn't know a
Stuart from a--chromo."Miss Erskine gave a little shriek of horror.Croyden!--you're playing on my credulity.I
shall have to give you some instructions.I will lecture on Stuart and
Peale, and the painters of their period, for your especial
delectation--and soon, very soon!""I'm afraid it would all be wasted," said Croyden."I'm not fond of
art, I confess--except on the commercial side; and if I've any
pictures, at Clarendon, worth money, I'll be for selling them."Will you listen--did you ever hear such heresy?""I can't believe it of you, Mr.Let me lend you
an article on Stuart to read.I shall bring it out to Clarendon
to-morrow morning--and you can let me look at all the dear treasures,
while you peruse it."Croyden has an appointment with me to-morrow, Amelia," said
Carrington, quickly--and Croyden gave him a look of gratitude."It will be but a pleasure deferred, then, Mr.Croyden," said Miss
Erskine, impenetrable in her self conceit."The next morning will do,
quite as well--I shall come at ten o'clock--What a lovely evening this
is, Mrs.The Captain snorted with sudden anger, and, abruptly excusing himself,
disappeared in the library.Miss Carrington stayed a moment, then, with
a word to Croyden, that she would show him the article now, before the
others came, if Miss Erskine would excuse them a moment, bore him off."Pompous and stupid--an irritating nuisance, I should call her.""She's more!--she is the most arrogant, self-opinionated,
self-complacent, vapid piece of humanity in this town or any other
town.She irritates me to the point of impoliteness.She never sees
that people don't want her."At first, yes--pretty soon you will be throwing things at her--or
wanting to."She thinks she's qualified to speak on every
subject under the sun, Literature--Bridge--Teaching--Music.She went away to some preparatory school, and
finished off with another that teaches pedagogy.Straightway she became
an adept in the art of instruction, though, when she tried it, she had
the whole academy by the ears in two weeks, and the faculty asked her
to resign.Next, she got some one to take her to Europe--spent six
weeks in looking at a lot of the famous paintings, with the aid of a
guide book and a catalogue, and came home prepared to lecture on
Art--and, what's more, she has the effrontery to do it--for the benefit
of Charity, she takes four-fifths of the proceeds, and Charity gets the
balance.She read the lives of Chopin and Wagner and some of
the other composers, went to a half dozen symphony concerts, looked up
theory, voice culture, and the like, in the encyclopaedias, and now
she's a critic!Literature she imbibed from the bottle, I suppose--it
came easy to _her_!And she passes judgment upon it with the utmost
ease and final authority.She doesn't hesitate to
arraign Elwell, and we, of the village, are the very dirt beneath her
feet.I hear she's thinking of taking up Civic Improvement.I hope it
is true--she'll likely run up against somebody who won't hesitate to
tell her what an idiot she is.""Why don't you throw her out
of society, metaphorically speaking.""We can't: she belongs--which is final with us, you know.Moreover, she
has imposed on some, with her assumption of superiority, and they
kowtow to her in a way that is positively disgusting.""Why don't you, and the rest who dislike her, snub her?"You can't snub her--she never takes a snub to herself.If
you were to hit her in the face, she would think it a mistake and meant
for some one else.""Then, why not do the next best thing--have fun with her?""We do--but even that grows monotonous, with such a mountain of
Egotism--she will stay for the Bridge this evening, see if she
doesn't--and never imagine she's not wanted."Then she laughed: "I
think if she does I'll give her to you!"If she is any more
cantankerous than some of the women at the Heights, she'll be an
interesting study.Yes, I'll be glad to play a rubber with her.""If you start, you'll play the entire evening with her--we don't change
partners, here.""Look on--at the _other_ table."Then the greater the sacrifice I'm making, the greater the credit I
should receive.""It depends--on how you acquit yourself," she said gayly."There are
the others, now--come along."Miss Tilghman, Miss Lashiel and Miss Tayloe,
Mr.They all had heard of
Croyden's arrival, in Hampton, and greeted him as they would one of
themselves.And it impressed him, as possibly nothing else could have
done--for it was distinctly new to him, after the manners of chilliness
and aloofness which were the ways of Northumberland."We are going to play Bridge, Miss Erskine, will you stay and join us?""This is an ideal
evening for Bridge, don't you think so, Mr."Yes, that's what we _thought_!""And who is to play with me, dear Davila?"Croyden, I am a very exacting
partner.I may find fault with you, if you violate rules--just draw
your attention to it, you know, so you will not let it occur again.I
cannot abide blunders, Mr.Croyden--there is no excuse for them, except
stupidity, and stupidity should put one out of the game.""I'll try to do my very best," said Croyden humbly."I do not doubt that you will," she replied easily, her manner plainly
implying further that she would soon see how much that "best" was.As they went in to the drawing-room, where the tables were arranged,
Miss Erskine leading, with a feeling of divine right and an appearance
of a Teddy bear, Byrd leaned over to Croyden and said:

"She's the limit!"said Leigh, "she's past the limit; she's the sublimated It!""Which is another way of saying, she's a superlative d---- fool!""Before you came, she tackled
me on Art, and, when I confessed to only the commercial side, and an
intention to sell the Stuart and Peale, which, it seems, are at
Clarendon, the pitying contempt was almost too much for me.""She's coming out to inspect my 'treasures,' on Thursday morning.""I shall turn her over to Moses, and decamp before she gets there."came Miss Erskine's voice."I trust I'm not at her
table."And he was not--Miss Tilghman and Dangerfield were designated."Come over and help to keep me straight," Croyden whispered to Miss
Carrington.She shook her head at him with a roguish smile."You'll find your partner amply able to keep you straight," she
answered.Miss Tilghman won the cut and made it a Royal Spade."They no longer play Royal Spades in New York," said Miss Erskine."Don't know about New York," returned Miss Tilghman, placidly, "but
_we're_ playing them here, this evening.The latter shut her thick lips tightly, an instant."Oh, well, I suppose we must be provincial a little longer," she said,
sarcastically."Of course, you do not still play Royal Spades in
Northumberland, Mr.Play anything to keep the game moving," Croyden
answered.I forgot, for the instant, that Northumberland _is_ a
rapid town.--I call that card, Edith--the King of Hearts!"as Miss
Tilghman inadvertently exposed it.A moment later, Miss Tilghman, through anger, also committed a revoke,
which her play on the succeeding trick disclosed.That it was a game for pure pleasure, without stakes, made no
difference to Miss Erskine.Technically it was a revoke, and she was
within her rights when she exclaimed it.she said exultantly, "and you cannot make game this
hand.""I'm very sorry, partner," Miss Tilghman apologized."It's entirely excusable under the circumstances," said Dangerfield,
with deliberate accent.Dangerfield is," Miss Erskine smiled."To my mind,
nothing excuses a revoke except sudden blindness.""And you would claim it even then, I suppose?""I said, sudden blindness was the only excuse, Mr.Had you
observed my language more closely, you doubtless would have
understood.--It is your lead, partner."Dangerfield, with a wink at Croyden, subsided, and the hand was
finished, as was the next, when Croyden was dummy, without further
jangling.But midway in the succeeding hand, Miss Erskine began.Croyden," she said, "when you have the Ace, King, and _no
more_ in a suit, you should lead the Ace and then the King, to show
that you have no more--give the down-and-out signal.We would have made
an extra trick, if you had done so--I could have given you a diamond to
trump.As it was, you led the King and then the Ace, and I supposed, of
course, you had at least four in suit.""I'm very sorry; I'll try to remember in future," said Croyden with
affected contrition.But, at the end of the hand, he was in disgrace again."If your original lead had been from your fourth best, partner, I could
have understood you," she said."As it was, you misinformed me.Under
the rule of eleven, I had but the nine to beat, I played the ten and
Mr.Dangerfield covered with the Knave, which by the rule you should
have held.We lost another trick by it, you see."Croyden answered; "that's two tricks we've
lost by my stupid playing.I'm afraid I'm pretty ignorant, Miss
Erskine, for I don't know what is meant by the rule of eleven."Miss Erskine's manner of cutting the cards was somewhat indicative of
her contempt--lingeringly, softly, putting them down as though she
scorned to touch them except with the tips of her fingers."The rule of eleven is usually one of the first things learned by a
beginner at Bridge," she said, witheringly."I do not always agree with
Mr.Elwell, some of whose reasoning and inferences, in my opinion, are
much forced, but his definition of this rule is very fair.I give it in
his exact words, which are: 'Deduct the size of the card led from
eleven, and the difference will show how many cards, higher than the
one led, are held outside the leader's hand.'For example: if you lead
a seven then there are four higher than the seven in the other three
hands.""What a bully rule!--It's very informing,
isn't it?""Yes, it's very informing--in more ways than one," she answered.Whereat Miss Tilghman laughed outright, and Dangerfield had to retrieve
a card from the floor, to hide his merriment.asked Miss Carrington, coming over to their
table."You people seem to be enjoying the game."Which sent Miss Tilghman into a gale of laughter, in which Dangerfield
joined.Miss Erskine frowned in disapproval and astonishment."They really know better, but
this is the silly season, I suppose.They have much to learn, too--much
to learn, indeed.""I was explaining a
few things about the game to Mr.Croyden, Davila, the rule of eleven
and the Ace-King lead, and, for some reason, it seemed to move them to
jollity."exclaimed Miss Carrington, her violet eyes gleaming
with suppressed mirth.Croyden does not think we were laughing at _him_!"returned Croyden solemnly, "and, if you were, my
stupidity quite justified it, I'm sure.If Miss Erskine will only bear
with me, I'll try to learn--Bully thing, that rule of eleven!"It was now Croyden's deal and the score, games all--Miss Erskine having
made thirty-six on hers, and Dangerfield having added enough to Miss
Tilghman's twenty-eight to, also, give them game."How cleverly you deal the cards," Miss Erskine remarked."You're
particularly nimble in the fingers.""I acquired it dealing faro," Croyden returned, innocently.exclaimed Miss Carrington, choking back a laugh."A game about which you should know nothing, my dear," Miss Erskine
interposed."Faro is played only in gambling hells and mining camps.""And in some of the Clubs _in New York_," Croyden added--at which Miss
Tilghman's mirth burst out afresh."That's where I learned to copper
the ace or to play it open.--I'll make it no trumps.""Somebody will win the rubber, this hand," Miss Erskine
platitudinized,--with the way such persons have of announcing a self
evident fact--as she spread out her hand."It is fair support,
partner."Then proceeded with much apparent thought and
deliberation, to play the hand like the veriest tyro.Miss Erskine fidgeted in her seat, gave half smothered exclamations,
looked at him appealingly at every misplay.Croyden
was wrapped in the game--utterly oblivious to anything but the
cards--leading the wrong one, throwing the wrong one, matching
pasteboards, that was all.And when, at the last, holding only a
thirteener and a fork in Clubs, he led the losing card of the latter,
she could endure the agony no longer."That is five tricks you have lost, Mr.Croyden, to say nothing of the
rubber!""I must go, now--a delightful game!thank you, my
dear Davila.So much obliged to you all, don't you know.Ah, Captain
Carrington, will you see me as far as the front gate?--I won't disturb
the game."Yes, I'll take her to the gate!"muttered the Captain aside to
Croyden, who was the very picture of contrition."But if she only were
a man!"I think it was lovely--perfectly lovely!"exclaimed Miss
Tilghman.--"Oh!that last hand was too funny for words.--If only you
could have seen her face, Mr.[Illustration: LEADING THE WRONG ONE, THROWING THE WRONG ONE, MATCHING
PASTEBOARDS, THAT WAS ALL]

"I didn't dare!""One look, and I'd have given the whole
thing away.""She never suspected.--I tell you, she is as dense as asphalt," said
Miss Carrington."Come, now we'll have some Bridge.""And I'll try to observe the rule of eleven!"He lingered a moment, after the game was ended and the others had gone.When he came to say good-night, he held Miss Carrington's slender
fingers a second longer than the occasion justified."As often as you wish," she answered."You have the advantage of
proximity, at least."VI

CONFIDENCE AND SCRUPLES


The next month, to Croyden, went pleasantly enough.He was occupied
with getting the household machinery to run according to his ideas--and
still retain Moses and Josephine, who, he early discovered, were
invaluable to him; in meeting the people worth knowing in the town and
vicinity, and in being entertained, and entertaining--all very quietly
and without ostentation.He had dined, or supped, or played Bridge at all the houses, had given
a few small things himself, and ended by paying off all scores with a
garden party at Clarendon, which Mrs.Carrington had managed for him
with exquisite taste (and, to him, amazing frugality)--and, more
wonderful still, with an entire effacement of _self_.It was Croyden's
party throughout, though her hand was at the helm, her brain
directed--and Hampton never knew.And the place _had_ looked attractive; with the house set in its wide
sweep of velvety lawn amid great trees and old-fashioned flowers and
hedges.With the furniture cleaned and polished, the old china
scattered in cupboard and on table, the portraits and commissions
freshly dusted, the swords glistening as of yore.And in that month, Croyden had come to like Hampton immensely.The
absence, in its society, of all attempts at show, to make-believe, to
impress, to hoodwink, was refreshingly novel to him, who, hitherto, had
known it only as a great sham, a huge affectation, with every one
striving to outdo everyone else, and all as hollow as a rotten gourd.He had not got used, however, to the individual espionage of the
country town--the habit of watching one's every movement, and telling
it, and drawing inferences therefrom--inferences tinctured according to
the personal feelings of the inferer.He learned that, in three weeks, they had him "taken" with every
eligible girl in town, engaged to four and undecided as to two more.They busied themselves with his food,--they nosed into his drinks, his
cigars, his cigarettes, his pipes,--they bothered themselves about his
meal hours,--they even inspected his wash when it hung on the line!The rest were totally different; they let every
one alone.They did not intrude nor obtrude--they went their way, and
permitted every one to go his.So much had been the way of Northumberland, so much he had been used to
always.But--and here was the difference from Northumberland, the vital
difference, indeed--they were interested in you, if _you_ wished them
to be--and it was genuine interest, not pretense.This, and the way
they had treated him as one of them, because Colonel Duval had been
his father's friend, made Croyden feel very much at home.At intervals, he had taken old Parmenter's letter from its secret
drawer, and studied it, but he had been so much occupied with getting
acquainted, that he had done nothing else.Moreover, there was no
pressing need for haste.If the treasure had kept on Greenberry Point
for one hundred and ninety years, it would keep a few months longer.Besides, he was a bit uncertain whether or not he should confide in
someone, Captain Carrington or Major Borden.He would doubtless need
another man to help him, even if the location should be easily
determined, which, however, was most unlikely.For him, alone, to go
prying about on Greenberry Point, would surely occasion comment and
arouse suspicion--which would not be so likely if there were two of
them, and especially if one were a well-known resident of Maryland.He finally determined, however, to go across to Annapolis and look over
the ground, before he disclosed the secret to any one.When he came to look up the matter of transportation, however, he was
surprised to find that no boat ran between Annapolis and Hampton--or
any other port on the Eastern Shore.He either had to go by water to
Baltimore (which was available on only three days a week) and thence
finish his journey by rail or transfer to another boat, or else he had
to go by steam cars north to Wilmington, and then directly south again
to Annapolis.In either case, a day's journey between two towns that
were almost within seeing distance of each other, across the Bay.Of
the two, he chose to go by boat to Baltimore.Then, the afternoon of the day before it sailed, he received a
wire--delivered two hours and more after its receipt, in the leisurely
fashion of the Eastern Shore.It was from Macloud, and dated
Philadelphia.His reply brought Macloud in the morning train.Moses took his bag, and they walked out
to Clarendon."The truth is,
Colin, they're not popular down here.The old families won't have
them--they're innovations--the saddle horse and the family carriage are
still to the fore with them.Only the butcher, and the baker and the
candlestick maker have motors.There's one, now--he's the candlestick
maker, I think.It reminds me
of the one down South, where they wouldn't have electric cars.Then rather than commit the awful sin
of letting _new_ horses come into the city, they accepted the trolley.The fashion suits my pocketbook, however, so I've no kick coming.""What do you want with a car here, anyway?""It looks as
if you could walk from one end of the town to the other in fifteen
minutes.""And the baker et cetera have theirs only for show, I suppose?""Yes, that's about it--the roads, hereabout, are sandy and poor.""Then, I'm with your old families.They may be conservative, at times a
trifle too much so, but, in the main, their judgment's pretty reliable,
according to conditions.What sort of place did you find--I mean the
house?""Hum--I see--the aristocracy of birth, not dollars.""Exactly!--How do you do, Mr.Fitzhugh," as they passed a policeman in
uniform."You meet Fitzhugh every place
when he is off duty.His occupation does not figure, in
the least.""So you like it--Hampton, I mean?""I've been here a month--and that month I've enjoyed--thoroughly
enjoyed.However, I do miss the Clubs and their life.""I can understand," Macloud interjected."And the ability to get, instantly, anything you want----"

"Much of which you don't want--and wouldn't get, if you had to write
for it, or even to walk down town for it--which makes for economy,"
observed Macloud sententiously."But, more than either, I miss the personal isolation which one can
have in a big town, when he wishes it--and has always, in some
degree.""And _that_ gets on your nerves!""Well, you won't
mind it after a while, I think.You'll get used to it, and be quite
oblivious."I've been here only a short time, remember.Come back in six months,
say, and I may have kicks in plenty.""You may find it a bit dreary in winter--who the deuce is that girl
yonder, Geoffrey?"They were opposite Carrington's, and down the walk toward the gate was
coming the maid of the blue-black hair, and slender ankles.She wore a
blue linen gown, a black hat, and her face was framed by a white silk
parasol."That is Miss Carrington," said Croyden.Macloud looked at him with a grin."She has nothing to do with your liking the town, I suppose?""Well, she's not exactly a deterrent--and there are half a dozen more
of the same sort.Oh, on that score, Hampton's not half bad, my
friend!""You mean there are half a dozen of _that_ sort," with a slight jerk of
his head toward Miss Carrington, "who are unmarried?"Croyden nodded--then looked across; and both men raised their hats and
bowed."Several--but you let them _alone_--it's not fashionable here, as yet,
for a pretty married woman to have an affair.She loves her husband, or
acts it, at least.They're neither prudes nor prigs, but they are not
_that_.""But my experience has been that
the pretty married woman who won't flirt, if occasion offers where
there is no danger of being compromised, is a pretty scarce article."You're too cynical," said Croyden."We turn in here--this is
Clarendon.""I've been sympathizing with
you, because I thought you were living in a shack-of-a-place--and,
behold!""Yes, it is not bad," said Croyden."I've no ground for complaint, on
that head.I can, at least, be comfortable here.That evening, after dinner, when the two men were sitting in the
library while a short-lived thunder storm raged outside, Macloud, after
a long break in the conversation--which is the surest sign of
camaraderie among men--observed, apropos of nothing except the talk of
the morning:

"Lord!"You did, by damning it with faint praise.""Your present environment--and yet, look you!A comfortable house, fine
grounds, beautiful old furnishings, delicious victuals, and two <DW64>
servants, who are devoted to you, or the place--no matter which, for it
assures their permanence; the one a marvelous cook, the other a
competent man; and, by way of society, a lot of fine, old antebellum
families, with daughters like the Symphony in Blue, we saw this
morning."And that is not all," said Croyden, laughing and pointing to the
portraits."And you have come by them clean-handed, which is rare.--Moreover, I
fancy you are one who has them by inheritance, as well.""I'm glad to say I have--ancestors are distinctly
fashionable down here.But _that's_ not all I've got.""There is only one thing more--money," said Macloud."You haven't found
any of it down here, have you?""That is just what I don't know," Croyden replied, tossing away his
cigarette, and crossing to the desk by the window.He handed the Parmenter letter to Macloud."Read it through--the
endorsements last, in their order--and then tell me what you think of
it."..."These endorsements, I take it," said Macloud, "though without date and
signed only with initials, were made by the original addressee,
Marmaduke Duval, his son, who was presumably Daniel Duval, and Daniel
Duval's son, Marmaduke; the rest, of course, is plain.""That is correct," Croyden answered."I have made inquiries--Colonel
Duval's father was Marmaduke, whose son was Daniel, whose son was
Marmaduke, the addressee.""My dear fellow, I'm not denying it!I simply want your opinion--what
to do?""Have you shown this letter to anyone else?""Well, you're a fool to show it even to me.What assurance have you
that, when I leave here, I won't go straight to Annapolis and steal
your treasure?""No assurance, except a lamblike trust in your friendship," said
Croyden, with an amused smile."Your recent experience with Royster & Axtell and the Heights should
beget confidences of this kind?"he said sarcastically, tapping the
letter the while."You trust too much in friendship, Croyden.Tests of
half a million dollars aren't human!""I always
thought there was something God-like about me.But it was a fearful risk, man, a fearful risk!"The man to whom it was addressed
believed it--else why did he endorse it to his son?And we can assume
that Daniel Duval knew his father's writing, and accepted it.--Oh, it's
genuine enough.But to prove it, did you identify Marmaduke Duval's
writing--any papers or old letters in the house?""I don't know," returned Croyden."Better not arouse his curiosity--<DW54>s are most inquisitive, you
know--where did you find the letter?""Another proof of its genuineness," said Macloud."Have you made any
effort to identify this man Parmenter--from the records at
Annapolis.""No--I've done nothing but look at the letter--except to trace the
Duval descent," Croyden replied."He speaks, here, of his last will and testament being left with Mr.If it were probated, that will establish Parmenter, especially
if Marmaduke Duval is the legatee.I never was there--I looked it up on the map I found, here,
and Greenberry Point is as the letter says--across the Severn River
from it."Macloud laughed, in good-natured raillery."You seem to have been in a devil of a hurry!""At the same
rate of progression, you will go to Annapolis some time next spring,
and get over to Greenberry Point about autumn.""On the contrary, it's your coming that delayed me," Croyden smiled."But for your wire, I would have started this morning--now, if you will
accompany me, we'll go day-after-to-morrow.""It's a long journey around the Bay by rail--I'd rather cross to Baltimore
by boat; from there it's only an hour's ride to Annapolis by electric
cars.And there isn't any boat sailing until day-after-to-morrow.""Let me see where we are, and where
Annapolis is.... Hum!Can't we get a boat in
the morning to take us across direct--charter it, I mean?The
Chesapeake isn't wide at this point--a sailing vessel ought to make it
in a few hours."He went to the telephone and called
up Dick.he said.--"I've a friend who wants
to go across the Bay to Annapolis, in the morning.Where can I find out
if there is a sailing vessel, or a motor boat, obtainable?...Miles Casey?--on Fleet Street, near the wharf?...Thank you!--He says," turning to Macloud, "Casey will likely take
us--he has a fishing schooner and it is in port.He lives on Fleet
Street--we will walk down, presently, and see him."Macloud nodded assent, and fell to studying the directions again.Croyden returned to his chair and smoked in silence, waiting for his
friend to conclude.At length, the latter folded the letter and looked
up."It oughtn't to be hard to find," he observed."Not if the trees are still standing, and the Point is in the same
place," said Croyden."But we're going to find the Point shifted about
ninety degrees, and God knows how many feet, while the trees will have
long since disappeared.""Or the whole Point may be built over with houses!""Why not go the whole throw-down at once--make it impossible to
recover rather than only difficult to locate!"He made a gesture of
disbelief."Do you fancy that the Duvals didn't keep an eye on
Greenberry Point?--that they wouldn't have noted, in their
endorsements, any change in the ground?So it's clear, in my mind,
that, when Colonel Duval transferred this letter to you, the Parmenter
treasure could readily be located.""I'm sure I shan't object, in the least, if we walk directly to the
spot, and hit the box on the third dig of the pick!""But let us forget the old pirate, until to-morrow; tell me about
Northumberland--it seems a year since I left!When one goes away for
good and all, it's different, you know, from going away for the
summer.""And you think you have left it for good and all?"asked Macloud,
blowing a smoke-ring and watching him with contemplative eyes--"Well,
the place is the same--only more so.The Heights is more lively than when you left, teas, and dinners, and
tournaments and such like.--In town, the Northumberland's resuming its
regulars--the theatres are open, and the Club has taken the bald-headed
row on Monday nights as usual.Billy Cain has turned up engaged, also
as usual--this time, it's a Richmond girl,'regular screamer,' he says.It will last the allotted time, of course--six weeks was the limit for
the last two, you'll remember.Smythe put it all over Little in the
tennis tournament, and 'Pud' Lester won the golf championship.Terry's
horse, _Peach Blossom_, fell and broke its neck in the high jump, at
the Horse Show; Terry came out easier--he broke only his collar-bone.Mattison is the little bounder he always was--a month hasn't changed
him--except for the worse.Colloden is the
same bully fellow; he is disconsolate, now, because he is beginning to
take on flesh.""Danridge is back from the North
Cape, via Paris, with a new drink he calls _The Spasmodic_--it's made
of gin, whiskey, brandy, and absinthe, all in a pint of sarsaparilla.He says it's great--I've not sampled it, but judging from those who
have he is drawing it mild.... Betty Whitridge and Nancy Wellesly have
organized a Sinners Class, prerequisites for membership in which are
that you play Bridge on Sundays and have abstained from church for at
least six months.They filled it the first
morning, and have a waiting list of something over seventy-five....
That is about all I can think of that's new."Croyden asked--with the lingering
desire one has not to be forgot.Macloud shot a questioning glance at him."Beyond the fact that the bankruptcy schedules show you were pretty
hard hit, I've heard no one comment," he said.Elaine Cavendish is sponsor for that report--she says you told
her you were called, suddenly, abroad."Then, after a pause:

"Any one inclined to play the devoted, there?""Plenty inclined--plenty anxious," replied Macloud."I'm looking a bit
that way myself--I may get into the running, since you are out of it,"
he added.Croyden made as though to speak, then bit off the words."Yes, I'm out of it," he said shortly."But you're not out of it--if you find the pirate's treasure.""Wait until I find it--at present, I'm only an 'also ran.'""Who had the field, however, until withdrawn," said Macloud."But things have changed with me, Macloud;
I've had time for thought and meditation.I'm not sure I should go back
to Northumberland, even if the Parmenter jewels are real.Had I stayed
there I suppose I should have taken my chance with the rest, but I'm
becoming doubtful, recently, of giving such hostages to fortune.It's
all right for a woman to marry a rich man, but it is a totally
different proposition for a poor man to marry a rich woman.Even with
the Parmenter treasure, I'd be poor in comparison with Elaine Cavendish
and her millions--and I'm afraid the sweet bells would soon be jangling
out of tune.""Would you condemn the girl to spinsterhood, because there are few men
in Northumberland, or elsewhere, who can match her in wealth?"I mean, only, that the man should be able to support her
according to her condition in life.--In other words, pay all the bills,
without drawing on her fortune.""Those views will never make you the leader of a popular propaganda!"said Macloud, with an amused smile."In fact, you're alone in the
woods."But the views are not irrevocable--I may change, you know.In the meantime, let us go down to Fleet Street and interview Casey.And then, if you're good, I'll take you to call on Miss Carrington.""Come along, man, come
along!"VII

GREENBERRY POINT


There was no trouble with Casey--he had been mighty glad to take them.And, at about noon of the following day, they drew in to the ancient
capital, having made a quick and easy run from Hampton.It was clear, bright October weather, when late summer seems to linger
for very joy of staying, and all nature is in accord.The State House,
where Washington resigned his commission--with its chaste lines and
dignified white dome, when viewed from the Bay (where the monstrosity
of recent years that has been hung on behind, is not visible) stood out
clearly in the sunlight, standing high above the town, which slumbers,
in dignified ease, within its shadow.A few old mansions, up the Spa,
seen before they landed, with the promise of others concealed among the
trees, higher up, told their story of a Past departed--a finished
city."Yonder, sir, on the far side of the Severn--the strip of land which
juts out into the Bay.""First hypothesis, dead as a musket!""There isn't
a house in sight--except the light-house, and it's a bug-light.""No houses--but where are the trees?""It seems
pretty low," he said, to the skipper; "is it ever covered with water?""I think not, sir--the water's just eating it slowly away."Croyden nodded, and faced townward."What is the enormous white stone building, yonder?""The Naval Academy--that's only one of the buildings, sir, Bancroft
Hall.The whole Academy occupies a great stretch of land along the
Severn."They landed at the dock, at the foot of Market Place and inquired the
way to Carvel Hall--that being the hotel advised by Dick.They were
directed up Wayman's alley--one of the numerous three foot
thoroughfares between streets, in which the town abounds--to Prince
George Street, and turning northward on it for a block, past the once
splendid Brice house, now going slowly to decay, they arrived at the
hotel:--the central house of English brick with the wings on either
side, and a modern hotel building tacked on the rear.was Macloud's comment, as they ascended the steps
to the brick terrace and, thence, into the hotel."Isn't this an old
residence?"he inquired of the clerk, behind the desk.It's the William Paca (the Signer) mansion, but it served as
the home of Dorothy Manners in _Richard Carvel_, and hence the name,
sir: Carvel Hall.We've many fine houses here: the Chase House--he
also was a Signer; the Harwood House, said to be one of the most
perfect specimens of Colonial architecture in America; the Scott House,
on the Spa; the Brice House, next door; McDowell Hall, older than any
of them, was gutted by fire last year, but has been restored; the Ogle
mansion--he was Governor in the 1740's, I think.this was the Paris
of America before and during the Revolution.Why, sir, the tonnage of
the Port of Annapolis, in 1770, was greater than the tonnage of the
Port of Baltimore, to-day."What's
happened to it since 1770?""Nothing, sir--that's the trouble, it's progressed backward--and
Baltimore has taken its place.""It's being served now, sir--twelve-thirty to two.""Order a pair of saddle horses, and have them around at one-thirty,
please.""There is no livery connected with the hotel, sir, but I'll do what I
can.There isn't any saddlers for hire, but we will get you a pair of
'Cheney's Best,' sir--they're sometimes ridden.However, you had
better drive, if you will permit me to suggest, sir.""No!--we will try the horses," he said.It had been determined that they should ride for the reasons, as urged
by Macloud, that they could go on horseback where they could not in a
conveyance, and they would be less likely to occasion comment.The
former of which appealed to Croyden, though the latter did not.Macloud had borrowed an extra pair of riding breeches and puttees, from
his friend, and, at the time appointed, the two men passed through the
office.Two <DW64> lads were holding a pair of rawboned nags, that resembled
saddlers about as much as a cigar-store Indian does a sonata.Croyden
looked them over in undisguised disgust."If these are Cheney's Best," he commented, "what in Heaven's name are
his worst?"said Macloud, adjusting the stirrups."Get aboard and leave
the kicking to the horses, they may be better than they look."Straight up to the College green," he replied, pointing; "then one
square to the right to King George Street, and on out it, across
College Creek, to the Marine Barracks.The road forks there; you turn
to the right; and the bridge is at the foot of the hill.""He ought to write a guide book," said Croyden."Well paved
streets,--but a trifle hard for riding.""And more than a trifle dirty," Croyden added."My horse isn't so
bad--how's yours?""He'll do!--This must be the Naval Academy," as they passed along a
high brick wall--"Yonder, are the Barracks--the Marines are drilling in
front."They clattered over the creek, rounded the quarters of the
"Hermaphrodites," and saw below them the wide bridge, almost a half a
mile long, which spans the Severn.The draw was open, to let a motor
boat pass through, but it closed before they reached it.Macloud exclaimed, drawing rein,
midway."Look at the high bluff, on the farther shore, with the view up
the river, on one side, and down the Bay, and clear across on the
other.... Now," as they wound up on the hill, "for the first road to
the right."laughed Croyden, as the road swung
abruptly westward and directly away from Greenberry Point."Let us go a little farther," said Macloud."There must be a way--a
bridle path, if nothing better--and, if we must, we can push straight
through the timber; there doesn't seem to be any fences.You see, it
was rational to ride."as one unexpectedly took off to the right,
among the trees, and bore almost immediately eastward.Presently they were startled by a series of explosions, a short
distance ahead.said Croyden, with mock
seriousness.We must be a mile and more from the Point.It's
some one blasting, I think.""It wasn't sufficiently muffled," Croyden answered.They waited a few moments: hearing no further noises, they proceeded--a
trifle cautiously, however.A little further on, they came upon a wood
cutter."He doesn't appear at all alarmed," Croyden observed."What were the
explosions, a minute ago?""They weren't nothing," said the man, leaning on his axe."The Navy's
got a'speriment house over here.Yer don't
need be skeered.If yer goin' to the station, it's just a little ways,
now," he added, with the country-man's curiosity--which they did not
satisfy.They passed the buildings of the Experiment Station and continued on,
amid pine and dogwood, elms and beeches.They were travelling parallel
with the Severn, and not very distant, as occasional glimpses of blue
water, through the trees, revealed.The
river became plainly visible with the Bay itself shimmering to the
fore.Then the trees ended abruptly, and they came out on Greenberry
Point: a long, flat, triangular-shaped piece of ground, possibly two
hundred yards across the base, and three hundred from base to point."Somewhere near here, possibly just where your horse is standing, is
the treasure," said Macloud.laughed Croyden, "and that appears to be my only chance,
for I can't see a trace of the trees which formed the square.""Remember, you didn't expect to
find things marked off for you."It's amazingly easier than I dared to hope."we can't dig six feet deep over all of forty acres.We
shall have the whole of Annapolis over to help us before we've done a
square of forty feet.""The instructions say: seven hundred and fifty feet
back, from the extreme tip of Greenberry Point, is the quadrangle of
trees.That was in 1720, one hundred and ninety years ago.They must
have been of good size then--hence, they would be of the greater size,
now, or else have disappeared entirely.There isn't a single tree which
could correspond with Parmenter's, closer than four hundred yards, and,
as the point would have been receding rather than gaining, we can
assume, with tolerable certainty, that the beeches have
vanished--either from decay or from wind storms, which must be very
severe over in this exposed land.Hence, must not our first quest be
for some trace of the trees?""That sounds reasonable," said Croyden, "and, if the Point has receded,
which is altogether likely, then we are pretty near the place.""Yes!--if the Point has simply receded, but if it has shifted
laterally, as well, the problem is not so simple.""Let us go out to the Point, and look at the ruins of the light-house.If we can get near enough to ascertain when it was built, it may help
us.Evidently there was none erected here, in Parmenter's time, else
he would not have chosen this place to hide his treasure."But the light-house was a barren yield.It was a crumbling mass of
ruins, lying out in water, possibly fifty feet--the real house was a
bug-light farther out in the Bay."Well, there's no one to see us, so why shouldn't we make a search for
the trees?"He went out on the extreme edge, faced about, and taking a line at
right angles to it, stepped two hundred and fifty paces.He ended in
sand--and, for another fifty paces, sand--sand unrelieved by aught save
some low bushes sparsely scattered here and there."Somewhere hereabout, according to present conditions, the trees should
be," he said."Not very promising," was Croyden's comment."Let us assume that the diagonal lines drawn between the trees
intersect at this point," Macloud continued, producing a compass."Then, one hundred and ten paces North-by-North-East is the place we
seek."He stepped the distance carefully--Croyden following with the
horses--and sunk his heel into the sand beside a clump of wire grass."Here is the old buccaneer's hoard!"[Illustration: HE WENT OUT ON THE EXTREME EDGE, FACED ABOUT, AND STEPPED
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PACES]

"You dig--I'll hold the horses; your hands are tougher than mine."You mean, you would try to purchase
it?""Yes, as a site for a house, ostensibly.I might buy a lot beginning,
say one hundred and fifty yards back from the Point, and running, at an
even width of two hundred yards, from the Severn to the Bay."If the present owner will sell," appended Croyden--"and if his price
isn't out of all reason.I can't go much expense, you know.""Never mind the expense--that can be arranged.If he will sell, the
rest is easy."And we will share equally, then," said Croyden."I've got more money than I want, let me have
some fun with the excess, Croyden.And this promises more fun than I've
had for a year--hunting a buried treasure, within sight of Maryland's
capital.Moreover, it won't likely be out of reach of your own
pocketbook, this can't be very valuable land.""Let us ride around over the intended site, and prospect--we may
discover something."But, though, they searched for an hour, they were utterly unsuccessful.The four beech trees had disappeared as completely as though they never
were."I'm perfectly confident, however," Macloud remarked as they turned
away toward town, "that somewhere, within the lines of your proposed
lot, lie the Parmenter jewels.Once you have title to
it, you may plow up the whole thing to any depth you please, and no one
may gainsay you.""I'm not so sure," replied Croyden."My knowing that the treasure was
on it when purchased, may make me liable to my grantor for an
accounting.""Yet, I have every reason to believe--the letter is most specific.""Suppose, after you've paid a big price for the land, you don't find
the treasure, could you make him take it back and refund the purchase
money?""No, most assuredly, no," smiled Croyden.You must account for what you find--if you
don't find it, you must keep the land, anyway."It's predicated on the proposition that I have knowingly deceived him
into selling something for nothing.However, I'm not at all clear about
it; and we will buy if we can--and take the chances.But we won't go to
work with a brass band, old man."At the top of the hill, beyond the Severn, there was a road which took
off to the left."This parallels the road by the Marine Barracks, suppose we turn in
here," Macloud said.A little way on, they passed what was evidently a fine hospital, with
the United States flag flying over it.Just beyond, occupying the point
of land where College Creek empties into the Severn, was the Naval
Cemetery."They have the place of interment
exceedingly handy to the hospital.he asked,
indicating a huge dome, hideously ornate with gold and white, that
projected above the trees, some distance ahead."Unless it's a custard-and-cream pudding
for the Midshipmen's supper.I
recollect now: the Government has spent millions in erecting new
Academy buildings; and someone in the Navy remarked, 'If a certain chap
_had_ to kill somebody, he couldn't see why he hadn't selected the
fellow who was responsible for them--his work at Annapolis would have
been ample justification.'Judging from the atrocity to our fore, the
officer didn't overdraw it."They took the road along the officers' quarters on Upshur Row, and came
out the upper gate into King George Street, thereby missing the Chapel
(of the custard-and-cream dome) and all the other Smith buildings."The real estate agent is more
important now."It was the quiet hour when they got back to the hotel, and the clerk
was standing in the doorway, sunning himself."It wasn't bad," returned Croyden."Can you tell me
who owns Greenberry Point?"The Government owns it--they bought it for the Rifle
Range.""Yes, sir!--from the Point clear up to the Experiment Station.""That's the end of the purchase idea!""I thought it was'most
too good to last.""It got punctured very early," Macloud agreed."And the question is, what to do, now?Titles in a small
town are known, particularly, when they're in the United States.However, it's easy to verify--we'll hunt up a real estate
office--they'll know."But when they had dressed, and sought a real estate office, the last
doubt vanished: it confirmed the clerk."If you haven't anything particularly pressing," said Macloud, "I
suggest that we remain here for a few days and consider what is best to
do.""My most pressing business is to find the treasure!"then we're on the job until it's found--if it takes a year or
longer."And when Croyden looked his surprise: "I've nothing to do, old
chap, and one doesn't have the opportunity to go treasure hunting more
than once in a lifetime.Picture our satisfaction when we hear the pick
strike the iron box, and see the lid turned back, and the jewels
coruscating before us.""But what if there isn't any coruscating--that's a good word, old
man--nor any iron box?""Don't be so pessimistic--_think_ we're going to find it, it will help
a lot.""How about if we _don't_ find it?""Then, at least, we'll have had a good time in hunting, and have done
our best to succeed.""It's a new thing to hear old cynical Macloud preaching optimism!"laughed Croyden--"our last talk, in Northumberland, wasn't particularly
in that line, you'll remember.""Our talk in Northumberland had to do with other people and
conditions.This is an adventure, and has to do solely with ourselves.Some difference, my dear Croyden, some difference!What do you say to
an early breakfast to-morrow, and then a walk over to the Point.It's
something like your Eastern Shore to get to, however,--just across the
river by water, but three miles around by the Severn bridge.We can
have the whole day for prospecting.""I'm under your orders," said Croyden."You're in charge of this
expedition."They had been passing numerous naval officers in uniform, some well
set-up, some slouchy."The uniform surely does show up the man for what he is," said Macloud."Look at these two for instance--from the stripes on the sleeves, a
Lieutenant-Commander and a Senior Lieutenant.Did you ever see a real
Bowery tough?--they are in that class, with just enough veneer to
deceive, for an instant.Observe the dignity, the snappy walk, the inherent air
of command.""Isn't it the fault of the system?""Every Congressman
holds a competitive examination in his district; and the appointment
goes to the applicant who wins--be he what he may.For that reason, I
dare say, the Brigade of Midshipmen contains muckers as well as
gentlemen--and officers are but midshipmen of a larger growth."To be a commissioned officer, in
either Army or Navy, ought to attest one's gentle birth.""It raises a presumption in their favor, at least."do you think the two who passed us could hide behind that
presumption longer than the fraction of an instant?"I was accounting for it, not defending it.It's a pity, of course, but that's one of the misfortunes of a Republic
where all men are equal.""Men aren't equal!--they're born to
different social scales, different intellectualities, different
conditions otherwise.For the purpose of suffrage they may, in the
theory of our government, be equal--but we haven't yet demonstrated it.We have included the <DW64>, only
within the living generation--and it's entirely evident, now, we made a
monstrous mistake by doing it.laughed Macloud, as they ascended the steps of the
hotel."For my part, I'm for the Moslem's Paradise and the Houris who
attend the Faithful.And, speaking of houris!--see who's here!"Croyden glanced up--to see Elaine Cavendish and Charlotte Brundage
standing in the doorway.VIII

STOLEN


"This is, truly, a surprise!""Who would ever
have thought of meeting you two in this out-of-the-way place.""From abroad?--I haven't gone," said Croyden.She looked at him steadily a moment--Macloud was talking to Miss
Brundage."I don't know--it's difficult of
adjustment.--What brings you here, may I inquire?""We were in Washington and came over with the Westons to the Officers'
Hop to-night--given for the Secretary of something.He's one of the
Cabinet."Oh, I see," he answered; the relief in his voice would have missed a
less acute ear."To a tea at the Superintendent's, when the Westons join us."I haven't acquired the Washington habit,--yet!""Then go to the dance with us--Colin!"We're not invited--if that cuts any figure."Weston, I've presumed to ask Mr.Croyden to join our party to-night.""The Admiral and I shall be delighted to have them," Mrs.Weston
answered--"Will they also go with us to the tea?Macloud and Croyden accompanied them to the Academy gates, and then
returned to the hotel.In the narrow passage between the news-desk and the office, they
bumped, inadvertently, into two men.There were mutual excuses, and the
men went on.An hour or so later, Macloud, having changed into his evening clothes,
came into Croyden's room and found him down on his knees looking under
the bureau, and swearing vigorously.he said; "you _are_ a true pirate's heir!Old Parmenter,
himself, couldn't do it better."And incidentally searching for this, I suppose?"picking up a pearl
stud from under the bed."And when you've sufficiently recovered your equanimity," Macloud went
on, "you might let me see the aforesaid Parmenter's letter.I want to
cogitate over it."grinding in the stud--"my coat's on the chair,
yonder."exclaimed Croyden, ramming the last stud
home."Where would you think it is--in the small change pocket?""I'll do it with----" He stopped.said Macloud, holding up the coat.Croyden's fingers flew to the breast pocket--empty!to the other
pockets--no wallet!He seized his trousers; then his waistcoat--no
wallet."I had it when we left the Weston party--I felt
it in my pocket, as I bent to tie Miss Cavendish's shoe.""Then, it oughtn't to be difficult to find--it's lost between the
Sampson Gate and the hotel.I'm going out to search, possibly in the
fading light it has not been noticed.You telephone the office--and
then join me, as quickly as you can get into your clothes."He dashed out and down the stairs into the Exchange, passing midway,
with the barest nod, the Weston party, nor pausing to answer the
question Miss Cavendish flung after him.Once on the rear piazza, however, he went slowly down the broad white
steps to the broad brick walk--the electric lights were on, and he
noted, with keen regret, how bright they made it--and thence to the
Sampson Gate.He inquired of the guard stationed there,
and that, too, proving unavailing, left directions for its return, if
found.If any one reads that letter, the jig is up for us....
Here!boys," to a crowd of noisy urchins, sitting on the coping along
the street, "do you want to make a dollar?"The enthusiasm of the response, not to mention its unanimity,
threatened dire disaster to Macloud's toilet.You all can have a chance for
it.I've lost a wallet--a pocketbook--between the gate yonder and the
hotel.A moment later Croyden came down the
walk."I haven't got it," Macloud said, answering his look."I've been over
to the gate and back, and now I've put these gamins to work.They will
find it, if it's to be found."And what's more, there won't
be anything doing here--we shall never find the letter, Macloud.""That's my fear," Macloud admitted."Somebody's _stolen_ it," Croyden answered."Precisely!--do you recall our being jostled by two men in the narrow
corridor of the hotel?Well, then is when I lost my wallet.I wasn't in a position to drop it from my pocket."Macloud's hand sought his own breast pocket and stopped."I forgot to change, when I dressed.Maybe the other fellow made off
with mine.I'll go and investigate--you keep an eye on the boys."He flung them some small coins, thereby precipitating a scramble and a
fight, and they went slowly in."There is just one chance," he continued."Pickpockets usually abstract
the money, instantly, and throw the book and papers away.It may be the case here--they, likely, didn't
examine the letter, just saw it _was_ a letter and went no further.""That won't help us much," said Croyden."It will be found--it's only a
question of the pickpockets or some one else.""But the some one else may be honest."The finder may advertise--may look you up at the hotel--may----"

"May bring it back on a gold salver!"Our only hope is that the thief threw away the letter, and that
no one finds it until after we have the treasure.The man isn't born
who, under the circumstances, will renounce the opportunity for a half
million dollars.""Well, at the worst, we have an even chance!We know the
directions without the letter.Don't be discouraged, old man--we'll win
out, yet."It was sport--an adventure and a problem to work out, nothing
more.Now, if we have some one else to combat, so much greater the
adventure, and more intricate the problem.""Or isn't it well to get
them into it?"If we could jug the thieves quickly, and
recover the plunder, it might be well.On the other hand, they might
disclose the letter to the police or to some pal, or try even to treat
with us, on the threat of publicity.On the whole, I'm inclined to
secrecy--and, if the thieves show up on the Point, to have it out with
them.There are only two, so we shall not be overmatched.Moreover, we
can be sure they will keep it strictly to themselves, if we don't force
their hands by trying to arrest them."We will simply
advertise for the wallets to-morrow, as a bluff--and go to work in
earnest to find the treasure."They had entered the hotel again; in the Exchange, the rocking chair
brigade and the knocker's club were gathered."Why can't a hotel ever be free of
them?""Let's go in to dinner--I'm
hungry."The tall head-waiter received them like a host himself, and conducted
them down the room to a small table.A moment later, the Weston party
came in, with Montecute Mattison in tow, and were shown to one nearby,
with Harvey's most impressive manner.An Admiral is some pumpkins in Annapolis, when he is on the _active_
list.Weston and the young ladies looked over and nodded; Croyden and
Macloud arose and bowed.They saw Miss Cavendish lean toward the
Admiral and say a word."We would be glad to have you join us," said he, with a man's fine
indifference to the fact that their table was, already, scarcely large
enough for five."I am afraid we should crowd you, sir.Thank you!--we'll join you
later, if we may," replied Macloud.A little time after, they heard Mattison's irritating voice, pitched
loud enough to reach them:

"I wonder what Croyden's doing here with Macloud?""I
thought you said, Elaine, that he had skipped for foreign parts, after
the Royster smash, last September."Mattison, I _thought_ he had gone abroad, but I most
assuredly did not say, nor infer, that he had _skipped_, nor connect
his going with Royster's failure!""If you
must say unjust and unkind things, don't make other people responsible
for them, please.Then he shot a look
at his friend."I don't mind," said Croyden."They may think what they please--and
Mattison's venom is sprinkled so indiscriminately it doesn't hurt.They dallied through dinner, and finished at the same time as the
Westons.Croyden walked out with Miss Cavendish."I couldn't help overhearing that remark of Mattison's--the beggar
intended that I should," said he--"and I want to thank you, Elaine, for
your 'come back' at him.""I'm sorry I didn't come back harder," said she."And if you prefer me not to go with you to the Hop to-night don't
hesitate to say so--I'll understand, perfectly.The Westons may have
got a wrong impression----"

"The Westons haven't ridden in the same motor, from Washington to
Annapolis, with Montecute for nothing; but I'll set you straight, never
fear.We are going over in the car--there is room for you both, and
Mrs.It's the fashion to
go early, here, it seems."Zimmerman was swinging his red-coated military band through a dreamy,
sensuous waltz, as they entered the gymnasium, where the Hops, at the
Naval Academy, are held.The bareness of the huge room was gone
entirely--concealed by flags and bunting, which hung in brilliant
festoons from the galleries and the roof.Myriads of variegated lights
flashed back the glitter of epaulet and the gleam of white shoulders,
with, here and there, the black of the civilian looking strangely
incongruous amid the throng that danced itself into a very kaleidoscope
of color.The Secretary was a very ordinary man, who had a place in the Cabinet
as a reward for political deeds done, and to be done.He represented a
State machine, nothing more.Quality, temperament, fitness, poise had
nothing to do with his selection.His wife was his equivalent, though,
superficially, she appeared to better advantage, thanks to a Parisian
modiste with exquisite taste, and her fond husband's bottomless bank
account.Having passed the receiving line, the Westons held a small reception of
their own.The Admiral was still upon the active list, with four years
of service ahead of him.He was to be the next Aide on Personnel, the
knowing ones said, and the orders were being looked for every day.Therefore he was decidedly a personage to tie to--more important even
than the Secretary, himself, who was a mere figurehead in the
Department.And the officers--and their wives, too, if they were
married--crowded around the Westons, fairly walking over one another in
their efforts to be noticed.Croyden asked Miss Cavendish as they joined
the dancing throng.they're hailing the rising sun," she said--and explained:
"They would do the same if he were a mummy or had small-pox.(The watchword, in the Navy, is "grease."From the moment you enter the
Academy, as a plebe, until you have joined the lost souls on the
retired list, you are diligently engaged in greasing every one who
ranks you and in being greased by every one whom you rank.And the more
assiduous and adroit you are at the greasing business, the more
pleasant the life you lead.The man who ranks you can, when placed over
you, make life a burden or a pleasure as his fancy and his disposition
dictate.Consequently the "grease," and the higher the rank the greater
the "grease," and the number of "greasers.")"Well-named!--dirty, smeary, contaminating business," said Croyden."And the best 'greasers' have the best places, I reckon.I prefer the
unadorned garb of the civilian--and independence.I'll permit those
fellows to fight the battles and draw the rewards--they can do both
very well."He did not get another dance with her until well toward the end--and
would not then, if the lieutenant to whom it belonged had not been a
second late--late enough to lose her."We are going back to Washington, in the morning," she said."Much as I'd like to do it.""Are you sure you would like to do it?""Geoffrey!--what is this business which keeps you here--in the East?""Which means, I must not ask, I suppose.""Will you tell me one thing--just one?""Has Royster &
Axtell's failure anything to do with it?""And is it true that you are seriously embarrassed--have lost most of
your fortune?"They danced half the length of the room before he replied.She, alone, deserved to know--and, if she cared, would
understand."I am not, however, in
the least embarrassed--I have no debts.""And is it 'business,' which keeps you?--will you ever come back to
Northumberland?""Yes, it is business that keeps me--important business.Whether or not
I shall return to Northumberland, depends on the outcome of that
business.""Why did you leave without a word of farewell to your friends?""Has any of my friends
cared--sincerely cared?Has any one so much as inquired for me?""They thought you were called to Europe, suddenly," she replied."For which thinking you were responsible, Elaine.""It was because of the failure," she said."You were the largest
creditor--you disappeared--there were queries and rumors--and I thought
it best to tell."On the contrary," he said, "I am very, very grateful to know that some
one thought of me."Another moment, and he might
have said what he knew was folly.Her body close to his, his arm around
her, the splendor of her bared shoulders, the perfume of her hair, the
glory of her face, were overcoming him, were intoxicating his senses,
were drugging him into non-resistance.The spell was broken not an
instant too soon.He shook himself--like a man rousing from dead
sleep--and took her back to their party.The next instant, as she was whirled away by another, she shot him an
alluringly fascinating smile, of intimate camaraderie, of
understanding, which well-nigh put him to sleep again."I would that I might get such a smile," sighed Macloud."She has the same smile for all
her friends, so don't be silly.""Moreover, if it's a different smile, the field is open."Can a man be scratched _after_ he has won?"Croyden retorted, as he turned away to search for his
partner.When the Hop was over, they said good-night at the foot of the stairs,
in the Exchange."We shall see you in the morning, of course--we leave about ten
o'clock," said Miss Cavendish."We shall be gone long before you are awake," answered Croyden.And,
when she looked at him inquiringly, he added: "It's an appointment that
may not be broken.""Well, till Northumberland, then!"But Elaine Cavendish's only reply was a meaning nod and another
fascinating smile.As they entered their own rooms, a little later, Macloud, in the lead,
switched on the lights--and stopped!"Hello!--our wallets, by all that's good!"cried Croyden, springing in, and stumbling over Macloud in
his eagerness.He seized his wallet!--A touch, and the story was told.No need to
investigate--it was as empty as the day it came from the shop, save for
a few visiting cards, and some trifling memoranda."You didn't fancy you would find it?""No, I didn't, but damn!"But the pity is that
won't help us.They've got old Parmenter's letter--and our ready cash
as well; but the cash does not count.""It counts with me," said Croyden."I'm out something over a
hundred--and that's considerable to me now.he asked.... "Thank you!--The
office says, they were found by one of the bell-boys in a garbage can
on King George Street.""If they mean fight, I reckon we can
accommodate them.IX

THE WAY OUT


"I've been thinking," said Croyden, as they footed it across the Severn
bridge, "that, if we knew the year in which the light-house was
erected, we could get the average encroachment of the sea every year,
and, by a little figuring, arrive at where the point was in 1720.It
would be approximate, of course, but it would give us a
start--something more definite than we have now.For all we know
Parmenter's treasure may be a hundred yards out in the Bay.""And if we don't find the date, here," he added, "we
can go to Washington and get it from the Navy Department.An inquiry
from Senator Rickrose will bring what we want, instantly.""At the same time, why shouldn't we get permission to camp on the Point
for a few weeks?""It would make it easy for us to
dig and investigate, and fish and measure, in fact, do whatever we
wished.Having a permit from the Department, would remove all
suspicion."We're fond of the open--with a town convenient!""I know Rickrose well, we can go down this afternoon and see
him.He will be so astonished that we are not seeking a political
favor, he will go to the Secretary himself and make ours a personal
request.Then we will get the necessary camp stuff, and be right on the
job."They had passed the Experiment Station and the Rifle Range, and were
rounding the shoal onto the Point, when the trotting of a rapidly
approaching horse came to them from the rear."Suppose we conceal ourselves, and take a look," suggested Macloud.He pointed to some rocks and bushes that lined the roadway.The next
instant, they had disappeared behind them.A moment more, and the horse and buggy came into view.In it were two
men--of medium size, dressed quietly, with nothing about them to
attract attention, save that the driver had a hook-nose, and the other
was bald, as the removal of his hat, an instant, showed."Yes--I'll bet a hundred on it!""Greenberry Point seems far off," said the driver--"I wonder if we can
have taken the wrong road?""This is the only one we could take," the other answered, "so we must
be right."Cussing himself for----" The rest was lost in the noise of the team.said Croyden, lifting himself from a bed of stones
and vines.And if I had a gun, I'd give the
Coroner a job with both of you.""It would be most effective," he said."But could we carry it off
cleanly?The law is embarrassing if we're detected, you know.""I never was more so," the other answered."I'd shoot those scoundrels
down without a second's hesitation, if I could do it and not be
caught.""However, your idea isn't
half bad; they wouldn't hesitate to do the same to us."They won't hesitate--and, what's more, they have the nerve to
take the chance.They waited until they could no longer hear the horse's hoof-falls nor
the rumble of the wheels.Then they started forward, keeping off the
road and taking a course that afforded the protection of the trees and
undergrowth.Presently, they caught sight of the two men--out in the
open, their heads together, poring over a paper, presumably the
Parmenter letter."It is not as easy finding the treasure, as it was to pick my pocket!""There's the letter--and there are the men who stole
it.And we are helpless to interfere, and they know it.It's about as
aggravating as----" He stopped, for want of a suitable comparison.Hook-nose went on to the Point, and
stood looking at the ruins of the light-house out in the Bay; the other
turned and viewed the trees that were nearest."Much comfort you'll get from either," muttered Croyden.Hook-nose returned, and the two held a prolonged conversation, each of
them gesticulating, now toward the water, and again toward the timber.Finally, one went down to the extreme point and stepped off two hundred
and fifty paces inland.Bald-head pointed to the trees, a hundred yards away, and shook his
head.Then they produced a compass, and ran the
additional distance to the North-east."You'll have to work your brain a bit," Croyden added."The letter's
not all that's needed, thank Heaven!You've stolen the one, but you
can't steal the other."The men, after consulting together, went to the buggy, took out two
picks and shovels, and, returning to the place, fell to work.After a short while, Bald-head threw down his pick and hoisted himself
out of the hole."He's got a glimmer of intelligence, at last," Croyden muttered.The discussion grew more animated, they waved their arms toward the
Bay, and toward the Severn, and toward the land.Hook-nose slammed his
pick up and down to emphasize his argument."They'll be doing the war dance, next!""'When thieves fall out, honest men come by their own,'" Croyden
quoted."_More_ honest men, you mean--the comparative degree.""Life is made up of comparatives," said Croyden.as Bald-head faced about and stalked back to the buggy."He has simply quit digging a hole at random," Macloud said."My Lord,
he's taking a drink!"Bald-head, however, did not return to his companion.Instead, he went
out to the Bay and stood looking across the water toward the bug-light.Then he turned and looked back toward the timber.The land had been driving inward by the
encroachment of the Bay--the beeches had, long since, disappeared, the
victims of the gales which swept the Point.There was no place from
which to start the measurements.Beyond the fact that, somewhere near
by, old Parmenter had buried his treasure, one hundred and ninety years
before, the letter was of no definite use to anyone.From the Point, he retraced his steps leisurely to his companion, who
had continued digging, said something--to which Hook-nose seemingly
made no reply, save by a shovel of sand--and continued directly toward
the timber."I think not--these bushes are ample protection.Lie low.... He's not
coming this way--he's going to inspect the big trees, on our left....
They won't help you, my light-fingered friend; they're not the right
sort."After a time, Bald-head abandoned the search and went back to his
friend.Throwing himself on the ground, he talked vigorously, and,
apparently, to some effect, for, presently, the digging ceased and
Hook-nose began to listen.At length, he tossed the pick and shovel
aside, and lifted himself out of the hole.After a few more
gesticulations, they picked up the tools and returned to the buggy.said Croyden, as they drove away.At the first heavy
undergrowth, they stopped the horse and proceeded carefully to conceal
the tools.This accomplished, they drove off toward the town."I wish we knew," Croyden returned."It might help us--for quite
between ourselves, Macloud, I think we're stumped.""Our first business is to move on Washington and get the permit,"
Macloud returned."Hook-nose and his friend may have the Point, for
to-day; they're not likely to injure it.They were passing the Marine Barracks when Croyden, who had been
pondering over the matter, suddenly broke out:

"We've got to get rid of those two fellows, Colin!""We agree that we dare not have them arrested--they would blow
everything to the police.And the police would either graft us for all
the jewels are worth, or inform the Government.""Yes, but we may have to take the risk--or else divide up with the
thieves."There is another way--except killing them,
which, of course, would be the most effective.Why shouldn't we
imprison them--be our own jailers?"Macloud threw away his cigarette and lit another before he replied,
then he shook his head."Too much risk to ourselves," he said."Somebody would likely be killed
in the operation, with the chances strongly favoring ourselves.I'd
rather shoot them down from ambush, at once.""That may require an explanation to a judge and jury, which would be a
trifle inconvenient.I'd prefer to risk my life in a fight.Then, if it
came to court, our reputation is good, while theirs is in the rogues'
gallery."Think over it, while we're going to
Washington and back; see if you can't find a way out.Either we must
jug them, securely, for a week or two, or we must arrest them.On the
whole, it might be wiser to let them go free--let them make a try for
the treasure, unmolested.When they fail and retire, we can begin.""Your last alternative doesn't sound particularly attractive to me--or
to you, either, I fancy.""This isn't going to be a particularly attractive quest, if we want to
succeed," said Croyden."Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways, I
reckon--blood and violence and sudden death.We'll try to play it
without death, however, if our opponents will permit.Such title, as
exists to Parmenter's hoard, is in me, and I am not minded to
relinquish it without a struggle.I wasn't especially keen at the
start, but I'm keen enough, now--and I don't propose to be blocked by
two rogues, if there is a way out.""And the way out, according to your notion, is to be our own jailers,
think you?""Well, we can chew on it--the manner of
procedure is apt to keep us occupied a few hours."They took the next train, on the Electric Line, to Washington, Macloud
having telephoned ahead and made an appointment with Senator
Rickrose--whom, luckily, they found at the Capital--to meet them at the
Metropolitan Club for luncheon.At Fourteenth Street, they changed to a
Connecticut Avenue car, and, dismounting at Seventeenth and dodging a
couple of automobiles, entered the Pompeian brick and granite building,
the home of the Club which has the most representative membership in
the country.Macloud was on the non-resident list, and the door-man, with the memory
for faces which comes from long practice, greeted him, instantly, by
name, though he had not seen him for months.Macloud, Senator Rickrose just came in," he said.He was very tall, with a tendency
to corpulency, which, however, was lost in his great height; very
dignified, and, for one of his service, very young--of immense
influence in the councils of his party, and the absolute dictator in
his own State.Inheriting a superb machine from a "matchless
leader,"--who died in the harness--he had developed it into a well
nigh perfect organization for political control.All power was in his
hands, from the lowest to the highest, he ruled with a sway as absolute
as a despot.His word was the ultimate law--from it an appeal did not
lie.he said to Macloud, dropping a hand on his
shoulder."I haven't seen you for a long time--and, Mr.Croyden, I
think I have met you in Northumberland.I'm glad, indeed, to see you
both."said Macloud, a little later, when they had finished
luncheon."I want to ask a slight favor--not political however--so it
won't have to be endorsed by the organization.""In that event, it is granted before you ask."Have the Secretary of the Navy issue us a permit to camp on Greenberry
Point.""Across the Severn River from Annapolis."Rickrose turned in his chair and glanced over the dining-room.Then he
raised his hand to the head waiter."Has the Secretary of the Navy had luncheon?""Yes, sir--before you came in.""We would better go over to the Department, at once, or we shall miss
him," he said."Chevy Chase is the drawing card, in the afternoon."The reception hour was long passed, but the Secretary was in and would
see Senator Rickrose.He came forward to meet him--a tall, middle-aged,
well-groomed man, with sandy hair, whose principal recommendation for
the post he filled was the fact that he was the largest contributor to
the campaign fund in his State, and his senior senator needed him in
his business, and had refrigerated him into the Cabinet for safe
keeping--that being the only job which insured him from being a
candidate for the Senator's own seat.said Rickrose, "my friends want a permit to camp for
two weeks on Greenberry Point."said the Secretary, vaguely--"that's somewhere out
in San Francisco harbor?""Not the Greenberry Point they mean," the Senator replied."It's down
at Annapolis--across the Severn from the Naval Academy, and forms part
of that command, I presume.It is waste land, unfortified and wind
swept."Why wouldn't the Superintendent give you a
permit?""We didn't think to ask him," said Macloud."We supposed it was
necessary to apply direct to you.""They are not familiar with the customs of the service," explained
Rickrose, "and, as I may run down to see them, just issue the permit to
me and party.The Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee is inspecting
the Point, if you need an excuse."none whatever--however, a duplicate will be forwarded to the
Superintendent.If it should prove incompatible with the interests of
the service," smiling, "he will inform the Department, and we shall
have to revoke it."He rang for his stenographer and dictated the permit.When it came in,
he signed it and passed it over to Rickrose."Anything else I can do for you, Senator?""Not to-day, thank you, Mr.asked Macloud, when they were in
the corridor.Hunting the Parmenter
treasure, with the Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee as a
disinterested spectator, was rather startling, to say the least."The campaign opens next week, and I'm drawn as
a spell-binder in the Pacific States.That figurehead was ruffling his
feathers on you, just to show himself, so I thought I'd comb him down a
bit.If you do, wire me, and
I'll get busy.I've got to go over to the State Department now, so I'll
say good-bye--anything else you want let me know.""Next for a sporting goods shop," said Macloud as they went down the
steps into Pennsylvania Avenue; "for a supply of small arms and
ammunition--and, incidentally, a couple of tents.We can get a few
cooking utensils in Annapolis, but we will take our meals at Carvel
Hall.I think neither of us is quite ready to turn cook.""We can hire a horse and
buggy by the week, and keep them handy--better get a small tent for the
horse, while we're about it."They went to a shop on F Street, where they purchased three tents of
suitable size, two Winchester rifles, and a pair of Colt's military
revolvers with six-and-a-half inch barrels, and the necessary
ammunition.These they directed should be sent to Annapolis
immediately.Cots and blankets could be procured there, with whatever
else was necessary.They were bound up F Street, toward the Electric Station, when Macloud
broke out."If we had another man with us, your imprisonment idea would not be so
difficult--we could bag our game much more easily, and guard them more
securely when we had them.As it is, it's mighty puzzling to
arrange."said Croyden, "but where is the man who is
trustworthy--not to mention willing to take the risk, of being killed
or tried for murder, for someone else's benefit?They're not many like
you, Colin."A man, who was looking listlessly in a window just ahead, turned away.He bore an air of dejection, and his clothes, while well cut, were
beginning to show hard usage and carelessness.Macloud observed--"and on his uppers!""He is down hard, a little money
with a small divide, if successful, will get him.Axtell saw them; he hesitated, whether to speak or to go on.Axtell grasped it, as a drowning man a straw.Mighty kind in one who lost so much
through us.""You were not to blame--Royster's responsible, and he's gone----"

"To hell!""Meanwhile, can I do anything for
you?You're having a run of hard luck, aren't you?"For a moment, Axtell did not answer--he was gulping down his thoughts."I've just ten dollars to my name.I came here
thinking the Congressmen, who made piles through our office, would get
me something, but they gave me the marble stare.I was good enough to
tip them off and do favors for them, but they're not remembering me
now.Do you know where I can get a job?""Yes--I'll give you fifty dollars and board, if you will come with us
for two weeks."Will I take it?--Well, rather!""What you're to do, with Mr.Macloud and myself, we will disclose
later.If, then, you don't care to aid us, we must ask you to keep
silence about it.""I'll do my part, and ask
no questions--and thank you for trusting me.You're the first man since
our failure, who hasn't hit me in the face--don't you think I
appreciate it?"nodding toward
a small bag, which Axtell had in his hand."Then, come along--we're bound for Annapolis, and the car leaves in ten
minutes."X

PIRATE'S GOLD BREEDS PIRATE'S WAYS


That evening, in the seclusion of their apartment at Carvel Hall, they
took Axtell into their confidence--to a certain extent (though, again,
he protested his willingness simply to obey orders).They told him, in
a general way, of Parmenter's bequest, and how Croyden came to be the
legatee--saying nothing of its great value, however--its location, the
loss of the letter the previous evening, the episode of the thieves on
the Point, that morning, and their evident intention to return to the
quest."Now, what we want to know is: are you ready to help us--unaided by the
law--to seize these men and hold them prisoners, while we search for
the treasure?""We may be killed in the attempt, or we
may kill one or both of them, and have to stand trial if detected.If
you don't want to take the risk, you have only to decline--and hold
your tongue."said Axtell, "I don't want you to pay me a
cent--just give me my board and lodging and I'll gladly aid you as long
as necessary.It's a very little thing to do for one who has lost so
much through us.You provide for our defense, if we're apprehended by
the law, and _that_" (snapping his fingers) "for the risk.""We'll shake hands on that, Axtell, if you please," he said; "and, if
we recover what Parmenter buried, you'll not regret it."The following morning saw them down at the Point with the equipage and
other paraphernalia.The men, whom they had brought from Annapolis for
the purpose, pitched the tents under the trees, ditched them, received
their pay, climbed into the wagons and rumbled away to town--puzzled
that anyone should want to camp on Greenberry Point when they had the
price of a hotel, and three square meals a day."It looks pretty good," said Croyden, when the canvases were up and
everything arranged--"and we shan't lack for the beautiful in nature.This is about the prettiest spot I've ever seen, the Chesapeake and the
broad river--the old town and the Academy buildings--the warships at
anchor--the _tout ensemble!_ We may not find the treasure, but, at
least, we've got a fine camp--though, I reckon, it is a bit breezy when
the wind is from the Bay.""I wonder if we should have paid our respects to the Superintendent
before poaching on his preserves?""Hum--hadn't thought of that!""Better go in and show
ourselves to him, this afternoon.He seems to be something of a
personage down here, and we don't want to offend him.These naval
officers, I'm told, are sticklers for dignity and the prerogatives due
their rank.""On that score, we've got some rank
ourselves to uphold."the Chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs, of the
United States Senate, is with us.According to the regulations, is it
his duty to call _first_ on the Superintendent?--that's the point.""However, the Superintendent has a copy
of the letter, and he will know the ropes.We will wait a day, then, if
he's quiescent, it's up to us.""You should have been a diplomat,
Croyden--nothing less than an Ambassadorship for you, my boy!""A motor boat would be mighty convenient to go back and forth to
Annapolis," he said."Look at the one cutting through the water there,
midway across!"It came nearer, halted a little way off in deep water, and an officer
in uniform swept the tents and them with a glass.Then the boat put
about and went chugging upstream."We didn't seem to please him," remarked Macloud, gazing after the
boat.Suddenly it turned in toward shore and made the landing at the
Experiment Station."We are about to be welcomed or else ordered off--I'll take a bet
either way," said Macloud."Otherwise, they wouldn't have
despatched an officer--it would have been a file of marines instead.You haven't lost the permit, Macloud!"Presently, the officer appeared, walking rapidly down the roadway.As
soon as he sighted the tents, he swung over toward them.Macloud went a
few steps forward to meet him."Senator Rickrose isn't coming until later.I am
one of his friends, Colin Macloud, and this is Mr."The
Superintendent presents his compliments and desires to place himself
and the Academy at your disposal."(He was instructed to add, that
Captain Boswick would pay his respects to-morrow, having been called to
Washington to-day by an unexpected wire, but the absence of the
Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee rendered it unnecessary.)"Thank Captain Boswick, for Senator Rickrose and us, and tell him we
appreciate his kindness exceedingly," Macloud answered."We're camping
here for a week or so, to try sleeping in the open, under sea air.Then they took several drinks, and the aide departed."So far, we're making delightful progress," said Croyden; "but there
are breakers ahead when Hook-nose and his partner get in the game.Suppose we inspect the premises and see if they have been here in our
absence."They went first to the place where they had seen them conceal the
tools--these were gone; proof that the thieves had paid a second visit
to the Point.But, search as they might, no evidence of work was
disclosed."Not very likely," replied Macloud, "with half a million at stake.They
probably are seeking information; when they have it, we shall see them
back again.""Suppose they bring four or five others to help them?""They won't--never fear!--they're not sharing the treasure with any one
else.Rather, they will knife each other for it.Honor among thieves is
like the Phoenix--it doesn't exist.""If the knifing business were to occur before the finding, it would
help some!""Meantime, I'm going to look at the ruins
of the light-house.I discovered in an almanac I found in the hotel
last night, that the original light-house was erected on Greenberry
Point in 1818.They went out to the extreme edge, and stood gazing across the shoals
toward the ruins."What do you make the distance from the land?""About one hundred yards--but it's very difficult to estimate over
water.It may be two hundred for all I can tell.""It is exactly three hundred and twenty-two feet from the Point to the
near side of the ruins," said Croyden."Why not three hundred and twenty-two and a half feet!""I measured it this morning while you were dawdling over your
breakfast," answered Croyden."Hitched a line to the land and waded out, I suppose.""Not exactly; I measured it on the Government map of the Harbor.It
gives the distance as three hundred and twenty-two feet, in plain
figures.""Now, what's the rest
of the figures--or haven't you worked it out?""The calculation is of value only on the
assumption--which, however, is altogether reasonable--that the
light-house, when erected, stood on the tip of the Point.It is now
three hundred and twenty-two feet in water.Therefore, dividing
ninety-two--the number of years since erection--into three hundred and
twenty-two, gives the average yearly encroachment of the Bay as three
and a half feet.Parmenter buried the casket in 1720, just a hundred
and ninety years ago; so, multiplying a hundred and ninety by three and
a half feet gives six hundred and sixty-five feet.In other words, the
Point, in 1720, projected six hundred and sixty-five feet further out
in the Bay than it does to-day.""Then, with the point moved in six hundred and sixty-five feet
Parmenter's beeches should be only eighty-five feet from the shore
line, instead of seven hundred and fifty!""As the Point from year to year slipped
into the Bay, the fierce gales, which sweep up the Chesapeake,
gradually ate into the timber.It is seventy years, at least, since
Parmenter's beeches went down.""Why shouldn't the Duvals have noticed the encroachment of the Bay, and
made a note of it on the letter?""Probably, because it was so gradual they did not observe it.They,
likely, came to Annapolis only occasionally, and Greenberry Point
seemed unchanged--always the same narrow stretch of sand, with large
trees to landward.""Next let us measure back eighty-five feet," said Croyden, producing a
tape-line.... "There!this is where the beech tree should stand.But
where were the other trees, and where did the two lines drawn from them
intersect?"...said Macloud--"where were the trees, and where
did the lines intersect?You had a compass yesterday, still got
it?"Macloud drew it out and tossed it over."I took the trouble to make a number of diagrams last night, and they
disclosed a peculiar thing.With the location of the first tree fixed,
it matters little where the others were, in determining the direction
of the treasure.The _objective point_ will
change as you change the position of the trees, but the _direction_
will vary scarcely at all.It is self-evident, of course, to those who
understand such things, but it was a valuable find for me.Now, if we
are correct in our assumption, thus far, the treasure is buried----"

He opened the compass, and having brought North under the needle, ran
his eye North-by-North-east.A queer look passed over his face, then he
glanced at Macloud and smiled."The treasure is buried," he repeated--"the treasure is buried--_out in
the Bay_.""Looks as if wading would be a bit difficult," he said dryly.Croyden produced the tape-line again, and they measured to the low
bluff at the water's edge."Two hundred and eighty-two feet to here," he said, "and Parmenter
buried the treasure at three hundred and thirty feet--therefore, it's
forty-eight feet out in the Bay.""Then your supposition is that, since Parmenter's time, the Bay has not
only encroached on the Point, but also has eaten in on the sides.""It's hard to dig in water," Macloud remarked."It's apt to fill in the
hole, you know.""Don't be sarcastic," Croyden retorted."I'm not responsible for the
Bay, nor the Point, nor Parmenter, nor anything else connected with the
fool quest, please remember.""Except the present measurements and the theory on which they're
based," Macloud replied."And as the former seem to be accurate, and
the latter more than reasonable, we'd best act on them.""At least, I am satisfied that the treasure lies either in the Bay, or
close on shore; if so, we have relieved ourselves from digging up the
entire Point.""You have given us a mighty plausible start," said Macloud.as a
buggy emerged from among the timber, circled around, and halted before
the tents."It is Hook-nose back again," said Macloud."Come to pay a social call,
I suppose!"They're safe--I put them under the blankets.""Come to treat with us--to share the treasure."By this time, they had been observed by the men in the buggy who,
immediately, came toward them.said Croyden, and they sauntered
along landward."And make them stop us--don't give the least indication that we know
them," added Macloud.As the buggy neared, Macloud and Croyden glanced carelessly at the
occupants, and were about to pass on, when Hook-nose calmly drew the
horse over in front of them."Which of you men is named Croyden?""Well, you're the man we're lookin' for.Geoffrey is the rest of your
handle, isn't it?""You have the advantage of me," Croyden assured him."Yes, I think I have, in more ways than your name.Where can we have a
little private talk?"said Croyden, stepping quickly around the horse and
continuing on his way--Macloud and Axtell following."If you'd rather have it before your friends, I'm perfectly ready to
accommodate you," said the fellow."I thought, however, you'd rather
keep the little secret.Well, we'll be waiting for you at the tents,
all right, my friend!""Macloud, we are going to bag those fellows right now--and easy, too,"
said Croyden."When we get to the tents, I'll take them into one--and
give them a chance to talk.When you and Axtell have the revolvers,
with one for me, you can join us.They are armed, of course, but only
with small pistols, likely, and you should have the drop on them before
they can draw.Come, at any time--I'll let down the tent flaps on the
plea of secrecy (since they've suggested it), so you can approach with
impunity.""This is where _we_ get killed, Axtell!""I would that I
were in my happy home, or any old place but here.But I've enlisted for
the war, so here goes!If you think it will do any good to pray, we can
just as well wait until you've put up a few.I'm not much in that line,
myself.""I can't," said Macloud."But there seem to be no rules to the game
we're playing, so I wanted to give you the opportunity."As they approached the tents, Hook-nose passed the reins to Bald-head
and got out."Leave it to me, I'll get them together," Croyden answered.... "You
wish to see me, privately?""I wish to see you--it's up to you whether to make it private or not."said Croyden, leading the way toward the tent, which was
pitched a trifle to one side.... "Now, sir, what is it?"as the flaps
dropped behind them."You've a business way about you, which I like----" began Hook-nose."Come to the point--what do
you want?""There's no false starts with you, my friend, are there!"You lost a letter recently----"

"Not at all," Croyden cut in."I had a letter _stolen_--you, I suppose,
are the thief.""I, or my pal--it matters not which," the fellow replied easily."Now,
what we want, is to make some arrangement as to the division of the
treasure, when you've found it.""Well, let me tell you there won't
be any arrangement made with you, alone.You must get your pal here--I
don't agree with one."Oh, very well, I'll have him in, if you wish."Hook-nose went to the front of the tent and raised the flap.he called, "hitch the horse and come in."And Macloud and Axtell heard and understood.While Hook-nose was summoning his partner, Croyden very naturally
retired to the rear of the tent, thus obliging the rogues to keep their
backs to the entrance."I'm glad to make your acquaint----" began Smith."There is no need for an introduction," Croyden interrupted curtly."You're thieves, by profession, and blackmailers, in addition.Get down
to business, if you please!""You're not overly polite, my friend--but we'll pass that by.You're
hell for business, and that's our style.You understand, I see, that
this treasure hunt has got to be kept quiet.If anyone peaches, the
Government's wise and Parmenter's chest is dumped into its strong
box--that is, as much as is left after the officials get their own
flippers out.Now, my idea is for you people to do the searching, and,
when the jewels is found, me and Bill will take half and youn's half.Then we all can knock off work, and live respectable.""Rather a good bargain for you," said Croyden."We supply the
information, do all the work and give up half the spoils--for what,
pray?""For our silence, and an equal share in the information.You have
doubtless forgot that we have the letter now.""Better
half a big loaf than no loaf at all.""I see what's in your mind, all right.But it won't work, and you know
it.You can have us arrested, yes--and lose your plunder.Parmenter's
money belongs to the United States because it's buried in United States
land.A word to the Treasury Department, with the old pirate's letter,
and the jig is up.We'll risk your giving us to the police, my friend!""If you're one to throw away good money, I miss
my guess.""I forgot to say, that as you're fixed so comfortable here, me and Bill
might as well stay with you--it will be more convenient, when you
uncover the chest, you know; in the excitement, you're liable to forget
that we come in for a share."His ears were
primed, and they told him that Macloud and Axtell were coming--"Let us
have them all, so I can decide--I want no afterthoughts.""You've got them all--and very reasonable they are!"Just then, Macloud and Axtell stepped noiselessly into the tent.Something in Croyden's face caused Hook-nose's laugh to end abruptly.He swung sharply around--and faced Macloud's leveled revolver--Axtell's
covered his pal.--Croyden cried--"None of that,
Hook-nose!--make another motion to draw a gun, and we'll scatter your
brains like chickenfeed."His own big revolver was sticking out of
Macloud's pocket."Now, I'll look after you, while my
friends tie up your pal, and the first one to open his head gets a
bullet down his throat.""Hands behind your back, Bald-head," commanded Axtell, briskly.Macloud is wonderfully easy on the trigger.He produced a pair of nippers, and snapped them on."Now, lie down and put your feet together--closer!"Now, I'll do for you," Axtell remarked, turning toward Hook-nose.With Croyden's and Macloud's guns both covering him, the fellow was
quickly secured."With your permission, we will search you," said Croyden."Macloud, if
you will look to Mr.Smith, I'll attend to Hook-nose.We'll give them a
taste of their own medicine.""I don't care to shoot a prisoner, but I'll do
it without hesitation.It's going to be either perfect quiet or
permanent sleep--and you may do the choosing."He slowly went through Hook-nose's clothes--finding a small pistol,
several well-filled wallets, and, in his inside waistcoat pocket, the
Parmenter letter.Macloud did the same for Bald-head."You stole one hundred and seventy-nine dollars from Mr.Macloud and
one hundred and eight from me," said Croyden."You may now have the
privilege of returning it, and the letter.If you make no more trouble,
lie quiet and take your medicine, you'll receive no further harm.If
you're stubborn, we'll either kill you and dump your bodies in the Bay,
or give you up to the police.The latter would be less trouble, for,
without the letter, you can tell your story to the Department, or
whomever else you please--it's your word against ours--and you are
thieves!""How long are you going to hold us prisoners?"asked Bald-head--"till
you find the treasure?"And luck is with you," Hook-nose sneered."At present, it _is_ with us--very much with us, my friend," said
Croyden."You will excuse us, now, we have pressing business,
elsewhere."When they were out of hearing, Macloud said:

"Doesn't our recovery of Parmenter's letter change things very
materially?""It seems to me it does," Croyden answered."Indeed, I think we need
fear the rogues no longer--we can simply have them arrested for the
theft of our wallets, or even release them entirely.""Arrest is preferable," said Macloud."It will obviate all danger of
our being shot at long range, by the beggars.Let us put them where
they're safe, for the time.""But the arrest must not be made here!""We can't
send for the police: if they find them here it would give color to
their story of a treasure on Greenberry Point.""Then Axtell and I will remain on guard, while you go to town and
arrange for their apprehension--say, just as they come off the Severn
bridge."What if they don't cross the Severn--what if they scent our game, and
keep straight on to Baltimore?They can abandon their team, and catch a
Short Line train at a way station.""Then the Baltimore police can round them up.They've lost Parmenter's letter; haven't anything to substantiate their
story.Furthermore, we have a permit for the Chairman of the Naval
Affairs Committee and friends to camp here.I think that, now, we can
afford to ignore them--the recovery of the letter was exceedingly
lucky."said Macloud--"you're the one to be satisfied; it's a
whole heap easier than running a private prison ourselves."Croyden looked the other's horse over carefully, so he could describe
it accurately, then they hitched up their own team and he drove off to
Annapolis."I told the Mayor we had passed two men on
the Severn bridge whom we identified as those who picked our pockets,
Wednesday evening, in Carvel Hall--and gave him the necessary
descriptions.He recognized the team as one of 'Cheney's Best,' and
will have the entire police force--which consists of four men--waiting
at the bridge on the Annapolis side.""They are
there, now, so we can turn the prisoners loose."Croyden and Macloud resumed their revolvers, and returned to the
tent--to be greeted with a volley of profanity which, for fluency and
vocabulary, was distinctly marvelous.Gradually, it died away--for want
of breath and words."In the cuss line, you two are the real
thing.Why didn't you open up sooner?--you shouldn't hide such
proficiency from an admiring world."Whereat it flowed forth afresh from Hook-nose.Bald-head, however,
remained quiet, and there was a faint twinkle in his eyes, as though he
caught the humor of the situation.They were severely cramped, and in
considerable pain, but their condition was not likely to be benefited
by swearing at their captors.said Croyden, as Hook-nose took a fresh start.Now, if you'll be quiet a moment, like
your pal, we will tell you something that possibly you'll not be averse
to hear.... So, that's better.We're about to release you--let you go
free; it's too much bother to keep you prisoners.These little toy guns
of yours, however, we shall throw into the Bay, in interest of the
public peace.Now, you may arise and shake yourselves--you'll, likely,
find the circulation a trifle restricted, for a few minutes."Hook-nose gave him a malevolent look, but made no reply, Bald-head
grinned broadly."Now, if you have sufficiently recovered, we will escort you to your
carriage!And with the two thieves in front, and the three revolvers bringing up
the rear, they proceeded to the buggy.XI

ELAINE CAVENDISH


"May we have seen the last of you!"said Macloud, as the buggy
disappeared among the trees; "and may the police provide for you in
future.""And while you're about it," said Croyden, "you might pray that we find
the treasure--it would be quite as effective."Now, to resume where those rogues interrupted us.We had the jewels located, somewhere, within a radius of fifty feet.They must be, according to our theory, either on the bank or in the
Bay.We can't go at the water without a boat.Shall we tackle the land
at once?or go to town and procure a boat, and be ready for either in
the morning.""I have an idea," said Macloud."Don't let it go to waste, old man, let's have it!""If you can give up hearing yourself talk, for a moment, I'll try!""It is conceded, I believe, that digging on the Point
by day may, probably will, provoke comment and possibly investigation
as well.Then as soon as dusky
Night has drawn her robes about her----"

"Oh, Lord!"ejaculated Croyden, with upraised hands."Then, as soon as dusky Night has drawn her robes about her," Macloud
repeated, imperturbably, "we set to work, by the light of the silvery
moon.We arouse no comment--provoke no investigation.When morning
dawns, the sands are undisturbed, and we are sleeping as peacefully as
guinea pigs.""And if there isn't a moon, we will set to work by the light of the
silvery lantern, I reckon!""And, when we tackle the water, it will be in a silver boat and with
silver cuirasses and silver helmets, a la Lohengrin.""And I suppose, our swan-song will be played on silver flutes!""There won't be a swan-song--we're going to find Parmenter's treasure,"
said Macloud.Leaving Axtell in camp, they drove to town, stopping at the North end
of the Severn bridge to hire a row-boat,--a number of which were drawn
up on the bank--and to arrange for it to be sent around to the far end
of the Point.At the hotel, they found a telephone call from the
Mayor's office awaiting them.The thieves had been duly captured, the Mayor said, and they had been
sent to Baltimore.The Chief of Detectives happened to be in the
office, when they were brought in, and had instantly recognized them as
well-known criminals, wanted in Philadelphia for a particularly
atrocious hold-up.He had, thereupon, thought it best to let the Chief
take them back with him, thus saving the County the cost of a trial,
and the penitentiary expense--as well as sparing Mr.Croyden and his
friend much trouble and inconvenience in attending court.He had had
them searched, but found nothing which could be identified.Croyden assured him it was more than satisfactory.That night, and every night for the
next three weeks, they kept at it.They dug up the entire zone
of suspicion--it being loose sand and easy to handle.On the plea that
a valuable ruby ring had been lost overboard while fishing, they
dragged and scraped the bottom of the Bay for a hundred yards around.Nothing smiled on them but the weather--it had
remained uniformly good until the last two days before.Then there had
set in, from the North-east, such a storm of rain as they had never
seen.The very Bay seemed to be gathered up and dashed over the Point.They had sought refuge in the hotel, when the first chilly blasts of
wind and water came up the Chesapeake.As it grew fiercer,--and a <DW64>
sent out for information returned with the news that their tents had
been blown away, and all trace of the camp had vanished--it was
decided that the quest should be abandoned."We knew from the first it
couldn't succeed.""But we wanted to prove that it couldn't succeed," Macloud observed."If you hadn't searched, you always would have thought that, maybe, you
could have been successful.Now, you've had your try--and you've
failed.It will be easier to reconcile yourself to failure, than not to
have tried.""In other words, it's better to have tried and lost, than never to have
tried at all," Croyden answered.it's over and there's no profit
in thinking more about it.We have had an enjoyable camp, and the camp
is ended.I'll go home and try to forget Parmenter, and the jewel box
he buried down on Greenberry Point.""I think I'll go with you," said Macloud."To Hampton--if you can put up with me a little longer."A knowing smile broke over Croyden's face."Maybe!--and maybe it is just you.At any rate, I'll come if I may."You know you're more than welcome, always!""I'll go out to Northumberland to-night, arrange a few
matters which are overdue, and come down to Hampton as soon as I can
get away."*       *       *       *       *

The next afternoon, as Macloud was entering the wide doorway of the
Tuscarora Trust Company, he met Elaine Cavendish coming out.There isn't a handy dinner man around, with you and Geoffrey
both away.Dine with us this evening, will you?--it will be strictly
_en famille_, for I want to talk business."he thought, as, having accepted, he went on
to the coupon department."It has to do with that beggar Croyden, I
reckon."*       *       *       *       *

And when, the dinner over, they were sitting before the open grate
fire, in the big living room, she broached the subject without
timidity, or false pride."You are more familiar with Geoffrey Croyden's affairs than any one
else, Colin," she said, crossing her knees, in the reckless fashion
women have now-a-days, and exposing a ravishing expanse of blue silk
stockings, with an unconscious consciousness that was delightfully
naive."And I want to ask you something--or rather, several things."Macloud blew a whiff of cigarette smoke into the fire, and waited."I, naturally, don't ask you to violate any confidence," she went on,
"but I fancy you may tell me this: was the particular business in which
Geoffrey was engaged, when I saw him in Annapolis, a success or a
failure?""Did he tell you anything concerning
it?""Only that his return to Northumberland would depend very much on the
outcome.""Well, it wasn't a success; in fact, it was a complete failure.""I do not mean, where is he this minute, but where
is he in general--where would you address a wire, or a letter, and know
that it would be received?"He threw his cigarette into the grate and lit another."I am not at liberty to tell," he said."Then, it is true--he is concealing himself.""Not exactly--he is not proclaiming himself----"

"Not proclaiming himself or his whereabouts to his Northumberland
friends, you mean?""Are there such things as friends, when one
has been unfortunate?""I can answer only for myself," she replied earnestly."I believe you, Elaine----"

"Then tell me this--is he in this country or abroad?""In this country," he said, after a pause."Is he in want,--I mean, in want for the things he has been used to?""He is not in want, I can assure you!--and much that he was used to
having, he has no use for, now."Why did he leave Northumberland so suddenly?"He was forced to give up the old life, so he chose
wisely, I think--to go where his income was sufficient for his needs."She was silent for a while, staring into the blaze.He did not
interrupt--thinking it wise to let her own thoughts shape the way."You will not tell me where he is?"she said suddenly, bending her blue
eyes hard upon his face.I ought not to have told you he was not abroad.""This business which you and he were on, in Annapolis--it failed, you
say?""And is there no chance that it may succeed, some time?""But may not conditions change--something happen----" she began."It is the sort that does not happen.In this case, abandonment spells
finis.""Did he know, when we were in Annapolis?""On the contrary, he was very sanguine--it looked most promising
then."He blew ring after ring of smoke, and
waited, patiently.He was the friend, he saw, now.Croyden was the lucky fellow--and would not!Well, he had
his warning and it was in time.Since she was baring her soul to him,
as friend to friend, it was his duty to help her to the utmost of his
power.Suddenly, she uncrossed her knees and sat up."I have bought all the stock, and the remaining bonds of the Virginia
Development Company, from the bank that held them as collateral for
Royster & Axtell's loan," she said.I didn't
appear in the matter--my broker bought them in _your_ name, and paid
for them in actual money."She arose, and bending swiftly over, kissed him on the cheek."I am, also, Geoffrey Croyden's friend, but
there are temptations which mortal man cannot resist."she smiled, leaning over the back of his chair, and
putting her head perilously close to his--"but I trust you--though I
shan't kiss you again--at least, for the present.Now, you have been so
_very_ good about the bonds, I want you to be good some more.He held his hands before him, to put them out of temptation."Ask me to crawl in the grate, and see how quickly I do it!""It might prove my power, but I should lose my friend," she whispered.it's
already granted, that you should know, Elaine.""You're a very sweet boy," she said, going back to her seat.But that you're a very sweet girl, needs no
proof--unless----" looking at her with a meaning smile."I should accept it as such," he averred--"whenever you choose to
confer it.""_Confer_ smacks of reward for service done," she said."Will it bide
till then?""Wait--If you choose such pay, the----"

"I choose no pay," he interrupted."Then, the reward will be in kind," she answered enigmatically."I want
you----" She put one slender foot on the fender, and gazed at it,
meditatively, while the firelight stole covert glances at the silken
ankles thus exposed."I want you to purchase for me, from Geoffrey
Croyden, at par, his Virginia Development Company bonds," she said.I will give you a check, now----"

"Wait!"he said; "wait until he sells----"

"You think he won't sell?""I think he will have to be satisfied, first, as to the purchaser--in
plain words, that it isn't either you or I. We can't give Geoffrey
money!The bonds are practically worthless, as he knows only too
well.""I had thought of that," she said, "but, isn't it met by this very
plan?Your broker purchases the bonds for your account, but he,
naturally, declines to reveal the identity of his customer.You can,
truthfully, tell Geoffrey that _you_ are not buying them--for you're
not.And _I_--if he will only give me the chance--will assure him that
I am _not_ buying them from him--and you might confirm it, if he
asked."It's juggling with the facts--though true on the face," said
Macloud, "but it's pretty thin ice we're skating on."He may take the two hundred
thousand and ask no question.""You don't for a moment believe that!""It _is_ doubtful," she admitted."And you wouldn't think the same of him, if he did.""So, we are back to the thin ice.I'll do what I can; but, you forgot,
I am not at liberty to give his address to my brokers.I shall have to
take their written offer to buy, and forward it to him, which, in
itself will oblige me, at the same time, to tell him that _I_ am not
the purchaser.""I leave it entirely to you--manage it any way you see fit.All I ask,
is that you get him to sell.It's horrible to think of Geoffrey being
reduced to the bare necessities of life--for that's what it means, when
he goes 'where his income is sufficient for his needs.'""It's unfortunate, certainly: it would be vastly worse for a woman--to
go from luxury to frugality, from everything to relatively nothing is
positively pathetic.However, Croyden is not suffering--he has an
attractive house filled with old things, good victuals, a more than
competent cook, and plenty of society.He has cut out all the
non-essentials, and does the essentials economically.""You speak of your own knowledge,
not from his inferences?""Our own in the aggregate
or differentiated?"he laughed; "but quite the equal of our own
differentiated.If Croyden were a marrying man--with sufficient income
for two--I should give him about six months, at the outside.""And how much would you give one with sufficient for two--_yourself_,
for instance?""Just long enough to choose the girl--and convince her of the propriety
of the choice.""And do you expect to join Geoffrey, soon?""As soon as I can get through here,--probably in a day or two.""Then, we may look for the new Mrs.Macloud in time for the holidays, I
presume.--Sort of a Christmas gift?""About then--if I can pick among so many, and she ratifies the pick.""No!--there are so many I didn't have time to more than look them over.When I go back, I'll round them up, cut out the most likely, and try to
tie and brand her.""One would think, from your talk, that
Geoffrey was in a cowboy camp, with waitresses for society."He grinned, and lighted a fresh cigarette."And nothing can induce you to tell me the location of the camp?""Let us try the bond matter, first.If
he sells, I think he will return; if not, I'll then consider telling.""You're a good fellow, Colin, dear!"she whispered, leaning over and
giving his hand an affectionate little pat."You're so nice and
comfortable to have around--you never misunderstand, nor draw
inferences that you shouldn't.""Which means, I'm not to draw inferences now?""Nor at any other time," she remarked."Will be forthcoming," with an alluring smile."I've a mind to take part payment now," said he, intercepting the hand
before she could withdraw it.whisking it loose, and darting around a table.With a swift movement, she swept up her skirts and fled--around chairs,
and tables, across rugs, over sofas and couches--always manoeuvring to
gain the doorway, yet always finding him barring the way;--until, at
last, she was forced to refuge behind a huge davenport, standing with
one end against the wall.he demanded, coming slowly toward her in the
cul de sac."I'll be merciful," he said."It is five steps, until I reach
you--One!--Will you yield?""Four----"

Quick as thought, she dropped one hand on the back of the davenport;
there was a flash of slippers, lingerie and silk, and she was across
and racing for the door, now fair before her, leaving him only the echo
of a mocking laugh.she counted, tauntingly, from the hall."Why don't you
continue, sir?""I'll be good for to-night, Elaine--you
need have no further fear."She tossed her head ever so slightly, while a bantering look came into
her eyes."I'm not much afraid of you, now--nor any time," she answered."But you
have more courage than I would have thought, Colin--decidedly more!"XII

ONE LEARNED IN THE LAW


It was evening, when Croyden returned to Hampton--an evening which
contained no suggestion of the Autumn he had left behind him on the
Eastern Shore.It was raw, and damp, and chill, with the presage of
winter in its cold; the leaves were almost gone from the trees, the
blackening hand of frost was on flower and shrubbery.As he passed up
the dreary, deserted street, the wind was whistling through the
branches over head, and moaning around the houses like spirits of the
damned.He turned in at Clarendon--shivering a little at the prospect.He was
beginning to appreciate what a winter spent under such conditions
meant, where one's enjoyments and recreations are circumscribed by the
bounds of comparatively few houses and few people--people, he
suspected, who could not understand what he missed, of the hurly-burly
of life and amusement, even if they tried.Their ways were sufficient
for them; they were eminently satisfied with what they had; they could
not comprehend dissatisfaction in another, and would have no patience
with it.He could imagine the dismalness of Hampton, when contrasted with the
brightness of Northumberland.The theatres, the clubs, the constant
dinners, the evening affairs, the social whirl with all that it
comprehended, compared with an occasional dinner, a rare party,
interminable evenings spent, by his own fireside, alone!To be sure, Miss Carrington, and Miss Borden, and Miss Lashiel, and
Miss Tilghman, would be available, when they were home.But the winter
was when they went visiting, he remembered, from late November until
early April, and, at that period, the town saw them but little.There
was the Hampton Club, of course, but it was worse than nothing--an
opportunity to get mellow and to gamble, innocent enough to those who
were habituated to it, but dangerous to one who had fallen, by
adversity, from better things....

However, Macloud would be there, shortly, thank God!And the dear girls
were not going for a week or so, he hoped.And, when the worst came, he
could retire to the peacefulness of his library and try to eke out a
four months' existence, with the books, and magazines and papers.Moses held open the door, with a bow and a flourish, and the lights
leaped out to meet him.It was some cheer, at least, to come home to a
bright house, a full larder, faithful servants--and supper ready on the
table, and tuned to even a Clubman's taste."Moses, do you know if Miss Carrington's at home?"he asked, the coffee
on and his cigar lit.her am home, seh, I seed she herse'f dis mornin' cum down
de parf from de front poach wid de dawg, seh."Croyden nodded and went across the hall to the telephone.Miss Carrington, herself, answered his call.--Yes, she intended to be
home all evening.She would be delighted to see him and to hear a full
account of himself.He was rather surprised at his own alacrity, in finishing his cigar and
changing his clothes--and he wondered whether it was the girl, or the
companionship, or the opportunity to be free of himself?A little of
all three, he concluded.... But, especially, the _girl_, as she came
from the drawing-room to meet him."So you have really returned," she said, as he bowed over her slender
fingers."We were beginning to fear you had deserted us.""You are quite too modest," he replied."You don't appreciate your own
attractions."The "you" was plainly singular, but she refused to see it."Our own attractions require us to be modest," she returned; "with
a--man of the world.""Whatever I may have been, I am, now, a man of
Hampton.""You can never be a man of Hampton.""Why not, if I live among you?""If you live here--take on our ways, our beliefs, our mode of thinking,
you may, in a score of years, grow like us, outwardly; but, inwardly,
where the true like must start, _never_!"You've been bred differently, used to
different things, to doing them in a different way.We do things
slowly, leisurely, with a fine disregard of time, you, with the modern
rush, and bustle, and hurry.You are a man of the world--I repeat
it--up to the minute in everything--never lagging behind, unless you
wish.You never put off till to-morrow what you can do to-day.We never
do anything to-day that can be put off till to-morrow.""And which do you prefer, the to-day or the to-morrow?""It depends on my humor, and my location, at the time--though, I must
admit, the to-day makes for thrift, and business, and success in
acquiring wealth.""And success also in getting rid of it.It is a return toward the
primitive condition--the survival of the fittest.There must be losers
as well as acquirers."she exclaimed, "that one must lose in order
that another may gain.""But as we are not in Utopia or Altruria," he smiled, "it will continue
so to be.Why, even in Baltimore, they----"

"Oh, Baltimore is only an overgrown country town!""With half a million population, it is as
provincial as Hampton, and thanks God for it--the most smug,
self-satisfied, self-sufficient municipality in the land, with its
cobblestones, its drains-in-the-gutters, its how much-holier-than-thou
air about everything.""Because it happens to be on the main line between Washington and the
North.""At least, the people are nice, barring a few mushrooms who are making
a great to-do.""Yes, the people _are_ delightful!--And, when it comes to mushrooms,
Northumberland has Baltimore beaten to a frazzle."Northumberland society must be exceedingly large!""It is--but it's not overcrowded.About as many die every day, as are
born every night; and, at any rate, they don't interfere with those who
really belong--except to increase prices, and the cost of living, and
clog the avenue with automobiles."but whither it leads no one knows--to the devil,
likely--or a lemon garden.""'Blessed are the lemons on earth, for they shall be peaches in
Heaven!'""What a glorious peach your Miss Erskine will be," he replied."I'm afraid you don't appreciate the great honor the lady did you, in
condescending to view the _treasures_ of Clarendon, and to talk about
them afterward.To hear her, she is the most intimate friend you have
in Hampton."he said, "I'm glad you told me.Somehow, I'm always drawing
lemons.""Quite immaterial to the question, which is: A lemon or not a lemon?""If you could but see yourself at this moment, you would not ask," he
said, looking at her with amused scrutiny.The lovely face, the blue black hair, the fine figure in the simple
pink organdie, the slender ankles, the well-shod feet--a lemon!"But as I can't see myself, and have no mirror handy, your testimony is
desired," she insisted."Then you can't have any objection----"

"If you bring Miss Erskine in?""----if I take you there for a game of Bridge--shall we go this very
evening?""I don't wish--and we are growing very silly.Come, tell
about your Annapolis trip."It's a queer old town, Annapolis--they call it the 'Finished City!'It's got plenty of landmarks, and relics, but nothing more.If it were
not for the State Capitol and Naval Academy, it would be only a lot of
ruins, lost in the sand.No one on
the streets, no one in the shops, no one any place.--Deserted--until
there's a fire."But, with the
autumn and the Academy in session, the town seemed very much alive.We
sampled 'Cheney's Best,' Wegard's Cakes, and saw the Custard-and-Cream
Chapel.""You've been to Annapolis, sure!""There's only one thing
more--did you see Paul Jones?"You can't find him without the aid of a
detective or a guide.""No one!--and there is the shame.We accepted the vast labors and the
money of our Ambassador to France in locating the remains of America's
first Naval Hero; we sent an Embassy and a warship to bring them back;
we received them with honor, orated over them, fired guns over them.And then, when the spectators had departed--assuming they were to be
deposited in the crypt of the Chapel--we calmly chucked them away on a
couple of trestles, under a stairway in Bancroft Hall, as we would an
old broom or a tin can.That's _our_ way of honoring the only Naval
Commander we had in the Revolution.It would have been better, much
better, had we left him to rest in the quiet seclusion of his grave in
France--lost, save in memory, with the halo of the past and privacy of
death around him.""And why didn't we finish the work?""Why bring him here,
with the attendant expense, and then stop, just short of completion?Why didn't we inter him in the Chapel (though, God save me from burial
there), or any place, rather than on trestles under a stairway in a
midshipmen's dormitory?""Because the appropriation was exhausted, or because the Act wasn't
worded to include burial, or because the Superintendent didn't want the
bother, or because it was a nuisance to have the remains around--or
some other absurd reason.At all events, he is there in the cellar, and
he is likely to stay there, till Bancroft Hall is swallowed up by the
Bay.The junket to France, the parade, the speeches, the spectacular
part are over, so, who cares for the entombment, and the respect due
the distinguished dead?""I don't mean to be disrespectful," he observed, "but it's hard luck to
have one's bones disturbed, after more than a hundred years of
tranquillity, to be conveyed clear across the Atlantic, to be orated
over, and sermonized over, and, then, to be flung aside like old junk
and forgot.However, we have troubles of our own--I know I have--more
real than Paul Jones!He may be glad he's dead, so he won't have any to
worry over.In fact, it's a good thing to be dead--one is saved from a
heap of worry.""A daily struggle to procure fuel sufficient
to keep up the fire."Why not make an end of life, at once?""Sometimes, I'm tempted," he admitted."It's the leap in the dark, and
no returning, that restrains, I reckon--and the fact that we must face
it alone.You have
begged the question, or what amounts to it.But, to return to
Annapolis; what else did you see?""Then you know what I saw," he replied.This isn't the day of the rapier and the mask."She half closed her eyes and looked at him through the long lashes."What were you doing down on Greenberry Point?"I was in Annapolis--I saw your name on the
register--I inquired--and I had the tale of the camp.No one, however,
seemed to think it queer!"Camping out is entirely natural," Croyden answered."With the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs?""A party which until five days ago he had not joined--at least, so the
Superintendent told me, when I dined at his house.He happened to
mention your name, found I knew you--and we gossiped.Perhaps we
shouldn't, but we did."he didn't seem even to wonder at your being there----"

"But _you_ did?""It's the small town in me, I suppose--to be curious about other people
and their business; and it was most suspicious."First, you hire a boat and cross the Bay direct from
Hampton to Annapolis.Second, you procure, through Senator Rickrose, a
permit from the Secretary of the Navy to camp on Greenberry Point.Third, you actually do camp, there, for nearly, or quite three weeks.Why go clear to the Western Shore, and choose a
comparatively inaccessible and exposed location on United States
property, if the idea were only a camp?Why not camp over on Kent
Island, or on this coast?Anywhere, within a few miles of Hampton,
there are scores of places better adapted than Greenberry Point."With a series of premises, you can reach whatever conclusion
you wish--you're not bound by the probabilities.""You're simply obscuring the point," she insisted."In this instance,
my premises are facts which are not controverted.Why?----" She held up her hand.I'm simply
'chaffing of you,' don't you know!""With just a lingering curiosity, however," he added."A casual curiosity, rather," she amended."Which, some time, I shall gratify.You've trailed me down--we _were_
on Greenberry Point for a purpose, but nothing has come of it, yet--and
it's likely a failure."Croyden, I don't wish to know.It was a mistake to refer
to it.I should simply have forgot what I heard in Annapolis--I'll
forget now, if you will permit."You can't forget, if you would--and I
would not have you, if you could.Moreover, I inherited it along with
Clarendon, and, as you were my guide to the place, it's no more than
right that you should know.I think I shall confide in you--no use to
protest, it's got to come!""You are determined?--Very well, then, come over to the couch in the
corner, where we can sit close and you can whisper."She put out her hand and led him--and he
suffered himself to be led.when they were seated, "you may begin.Once upon a time----" and
laughed, softly."I'll take this, if you've no immediate use for it,"
she said, and released her hand from his."I shall want it back, presently, however.""Do you, by any chance, get all you want?"Else I would have kept what I already had."She put her hands behind her, and faced around."Well,--once upon a time----" Then he stopped."I'll go over to the
house and get the letter--it will tell you much better than I can.You
will wait here, _right here_, until I return?"She looked at him, with a tantalizing smile."Won't it be enough, if I am here _when_ you return?"When he came out on the piazza the rain had ceased, the clouds were
gone, the temperature had fallen, and the stars were shining brightly
in a winter sky.He strode quickly down the walk to the street and crossed it diagonally
to his own gates.As he passed under the light, which hung near the
entrance, a man walked from the shadow of the Clarendon grounds and
accosted him.Croyden halted, abruptly, just out of distance."With your permission, I will accompany you to your house--to which I
assume you are bound--for a few moments' private conversation."He was about thirty years of age, tall
and slender, was well dressed, in dark clothes, a light weight
top-coat, and a derby hat.His face was ordinary, however, and Croyden
had no recollection of ever having seen it--certainly not in Hampton."I'm not in the habit of discussing business with strangers, at night,
nor of taking them to my house," he answered, brusquely."If you have
anything to say to me, say it now, and be brief."Some one may hear us," the man objected."Pardon me, but I think, in this matter, you would have objection.""You'll say it quickly, and here, or not at all," snapped Croyden."It's scarcely a subject to be discussed on the street," he observed,
"but, if I must, I must.Did you ever hear of Robert Parmenter?Well, the business concerns a certain letter--need I
be more explicit?""If you wish to make your business intelligible.""As you wish," he said, "though it only consumes time, and I was under
the impression that you were in a hurry.However: To repeat--the
business concerns a letter, which has to do with a certain treasure
buried long ago, on Greenberry Point, by the said Robert Parmenter.Do
I make myself plain, now, sir?""Your language is entirely intelligible--though I cannot answer for the
facts recited."The man smiled imperturbably, and went on:

"The letter in question having come into your possession recently, you,
with two companions, spent three weeks encamped on Greenberry Point,
ostensibly for your health, or the night air, or anything else that
would deceive the Naval authorities.During which time, you dug up the
entire Point, dragged the waters immediately adjoining--and then
departed, very strangely choosing for it a time of storm and change of
weather.Evidently, the thieves had managed to
communicate with a confederate, and this was a hold-up."Therefore, it is entirely reasonable to suppose that your search was
not ineffectual.In plain words, you have recovered the treasure."Croyden only smiled, and waited, too."Very good!--we will proceed," said the stranger."The jewels were
found on Government land.It makes no difference whether recovered on
the Point or on the Bay--the law covering treasure trove, I am
informed, doesn't apply.The Government is entitled to the entire find,
it being the owner in fee of the land.""I have devoted my spare moments to the study of
the law----"

"And how to avoid it," Croyden interjected."And also how to prevent _others_ from avoiding it," he replied,
suggestively."Let us take up that phase, if it please you."asked Croyden, suppressing an inclination
to laugh."Then let us take it up, any way--unless you wish to forfeit your find
to the Government.""We are arriving, now, at the pith of the
matter.We will take Parmenter's estimate and
multiply it by two, though jewels have appreciated more than that in
valuation.Fifty thousand pounds is two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars, which will total, according to the calculation, half a million
dollars,--one half of which amount you pay us as our share."Why don't you call it properly--blackmail?""If you prefer blackmail to
share, it will not hinder the contract--seeing that it is quite as
illegal on your part as on ours.Share merely sounds a little better
but either obtains the same end.Call it what you
will--but _pay_.""If you are not familiar
with the law covering the subject under discussion, let me enlighten
you.""I was endeavoring to state the matter succinctly," the stranger
replied, refusing to be hurried or flustered."The Common Law and the
practice of the Treasury Department provide, that all treasure found on
Government land or within navigable waters, is Government property.If
declared by the finder, immediately, he shall be paid such reward as
the Secretary may determine.If he does not declare, and is informed
on, the informer gets the reward.You will observe that, under the law,
you have forfeited the jewels--I fancy I do not need to draw further
deductions.""No!--it's quite unnecessary," Croyden remarked."Your fellow thieves
went into that phase (good word, I like it!)rather fully, down on
Greenberry Point.Unluckily, they fell into the hands of the police,
almost immediately, and we have not been able to continue the
conversation.""I have the honor to continue the conversation--and, in the interim,
you have found the treasure.So, Parmenter's letter won't be
essential--the facts, circumstances, your own and Mr.Macloud's
testimony, will be sufficient to prove the Government's case.Then, as
you are aware, it's pay or go to prison for larceny.""There is one very material hypothesis, which you assume as a fact, but
which is, unfortunately, not a fact," said Croyden.The man laughed, good-humoredly."We don't ask you to acknowledge the
finding--just pay over the quarter of a million and we will forget
everything.""My good man, I'm speaking the truth!""Maybe it's
difficult for you to recognize, but it's the truth, none the less.I
only wish I _had_ the treasure--I think I'd be quite willing to share
it, even with a blackmailer!""I trust it will give no offence if I say I don't believe you."And, without more ado, he turned his back and went up the path to
Clarendon.XII

I COULD TELL SOME THINGS


When Croyden had got Parmenter's letter from the secret drawer in the
escritoire, he rang the old-fashioned pull-bell for Moses.It was only
a little after nine, and, though he did not require the <DW64> to remain
in attendance until he retired, he fancied the kitchen fire still held
him.In a moment Moses appeared--his eyes heavy
with the sleep from which he had been aroused."Moses, did you ever shoot a pistol?""Fur de Lawd, seh!Hit's bin so long sence I dun hit, I t'ink I'se
gun-shy, seh.""Yass, seh, I has don hit.""And you could do it again, if necessary?""I speck so, seh--leas'wise, I kin try--dough I'se mons'us unsuttin,
seh, mons'us unsuttin!""Uncertain of what--your shooting or your hitting?""Well, we're all of us somewhat uncertain in that line.At least you
know enough not to point the revolver toward yourself.""Hi!--I sut'n'y does!seh, I sut'n'y does!"said the <DW64>, with a
broad grin."There is a revolver, yonder, on the table," said Croyden, indicating
one of those they used on Greenberry Point."It's a self-cocker--you
simply pull the trigger and the action does the rest."Yass, seh, I onderstands," said Moses."Bring it here," Croyden ordered.Moses' fingers closed around the butt, a bit timorously, and he carried
it to his master."I'll show you the action," said Croyden."Here, is the ejector,"
throwing the chamber out, "it holds six shots, you see: but you never
put a cartridge under the firing-pin, because, if anything strikes the
trigger, it's likely to be discharged."Croyden loaded it, closed the cylinder, and passed it over to Moses,
who took it with a little more assurance.He was harkening back thirty
years, and more."What do yo warn me to do, seh?""I want you to sit down, here, while I'm away, and if any one tries to
get in this house, to-night, you're to shoot him.I'm going over to
Captain Carrington's--I'll be back by eleven o'clock.It isn't likely
you will be disturbed; if you are, one shot will frighten him off, even
if you don't hit him, and I'll hear the shot, and come back at once."Yass, seh!--I'm to shoot anyone what tries to get in.""You're to shoot anyone who tries to
_break_ in.don't shoot me, when I return, or any
one else who comes legitimately.Be sure he is an intruder, then bang
away.""Sut'n'y, seh!I'se dub'us bout hittin', but I kin bang
away right nuf.Does yo' spose any one will try to git in, seh?"Croyden smiled--"but you be ready for them, Moses, be
ready for them.It's just as well to provide against contingencies."as Croyden went out and the front door closed behind him,
"but dem 'tingencies is monty dang'ous t'ings to fools wid.I don'
likes hit, dat's whar I don'."Croyden found Miss Carrington just where he had left her--a quick
return to the sofa having been synchronous with his appearance in the
hall."I had a mind not to wait here," she said; "you were an inordinately
long time, Mr."I was, and I admit
it--but it can be explained.""Before you listen to me, listen to Robert Parmenter, deceased!"said
he, and gave her the letter."Oh, this is the letter--do you mean that I am to read it?"She read it through without a single word of comment--an amazing thing
in a woman, who, when her curiosity is aroused, can ask more questions
to the minute than can be answered in a month.When she had finished,
she turned back and read portions of it again, especially the direction
as to finding the treasure, and the postscript bequests by the Duvals.At last, she dropped the letter in her lap and looked up at Croyden."Most extraordinary in its
ordinariness, and most ordinary in its extraordinariness.And you
searched, carefully, for three weeks and found--nothing?""Now, I'll tell you about it.""First, tell me where you obtained this letter?""I found it by accident--in a secret compartment of an escritoire at
Clarendon," he answered."This is the tale of Parmenter's treasure--and how we did _not_ find
it!"Then he proceeded to narrate, briefly, the details--from the finding of
the letter to the present moment, dwelling particularly on the episode
of the theft of their wallets, the first and second coming of the
thieves to the Point, their capture and subsequent release, together
with the occurrence of this evening, when he was approached, by the
well-dressed stranger, at Clarendon's gates.And, once again, marvelous to relate, Miss Carrington did not
interrupt, through the entire course of the narrative.Nor did she
break the silence for a time after he had concluded, staring
thoughtfully, the while, down into the grate, where a smouldering back
log glowed fitfully."What do you intend to do, as to the treasure?"In the
words of the game, popular hereabout, he is playing a bobtail!""But he doesn't know it's a bobtail.He is convinced you found the
treasure," she objected."Let him make whatever trouble he can, it won't bother me, in the
least.""He is not acting alone," she persisted."He has confederates--they may
attack Clarendon, in an effort to capture the treasure."this is the twentieth century, not the seventeenth!""We don't'stand-by to repel boarders,' these days.""Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways!""Rather queer!--I've heard those same words before, in this
connection.""Possibly--though I don't recall it.Suppose you are attacked and
tortured till you reveal where you've hidden the jewels?""However, I
put Moses on guard--with a big revolver and orders to fire at anyone
molesting the house.If we hear a fusillade we'll know it's he shooting
up the neighborhood.""Then the same idea _did_ suggest itself to you!""Only to the extent of searching for the jewels--I regarded that as
vaguely possible, but there isn't the slightest danger of any one being
tortured.""You know best, I suppose," she said--"but you've had your warning--and
pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways.You've given up all hope of finding
the treasure--abandoned jewels worth--how many dollars?""Possibly half a million," he filled in."If you can suggest what to do--anything which hasn't been done, I
shall be only too glad to consider it.""You say you dug up the entire Point for a hundred yards inland?""And dredged the Bay for a hundred yards?"She puckered her brows in thought.He regarded her with an amused
smile."I don't see what you're to do, except to do it all over again," she
announced--"Now, don't laugh!It may sound foolish, but many a thing
has been found on a second seeking--and this, surely, is worth a
second, or a third, or even many seekings.""If there were any assurance of ultimate success, it would pay to spend
a lifetime hunting.The two essentials, however, are wanting: the
extreme tip of Greenberry Point in 1720, and the beech-trees.We made
the best guess at their location.More than that, the zone of
exploration embraced every possible extreme of territory--yet, we
failed.It will make nothing for success to try again.""Somewhere, in the Bay!--It's shoal water, for three or four hundred
feet around the Point, with a rock bottom.The Point itself has been
eaten into by the Bay, down to this rock.Parmenter's chest disappeared
with the land in which it was buried, and no man will find it now,
except by accident.""Without anyone having the fun of wasting it!"She took up Parmenter's letter again, and glanced over it.Then she
handed it back, and shook her head."It's too much for my poor brain," she said.We gave it rather more than a fair trial,
and, then, we gave it up.When I go home, to-night, I shall
return the letter to the escritoire where I found it, and forget it."You can return it to its hiding place," she reflected, "but you can't
cease wondering.Why didn't Marmaduke Duval get the treasure while the
landmarks were there?"Probably on account of old Parmenter's restriction that it be left
until the 'extremity of need.'""Probably," she said, "the Duvals would regard it as a matter of honor
to observe the exact terms of the bequest."It's only because they did so, that I got a chance to search!""You mean that, otherwise, there would be no buried treasure!"And with all that money, the Duvals
might have gone away from Hampton--might have experienced other
conditions.Colonel Duval might never have met your father--you might
have never come to Clarendon.--My goodness!"In the realm of pure conjecture," he answered."It is idle to theorize
on the might-have-beens, or what might-have-happened if the
what-did-happen hadn't happened.Dismiss it, at least, for this
evening.You asked what I was doing for three weeks at Annapolis, and I
have consumed a great while in answering--let us talk of something
else.What have you been doing in those three weeks?"A little Bridge, a few riding parties, some sails on the Bay,
with an occasional homily by Miss Erskine, when she had me cornered,
and I couldn't get away.Then is when I learned what a deep impression
you had made!""We both were learning, it seems," he replied."I don't quite understand," she said."You made an impression, also--of course, that's to be expected, but
this impression is much more than the ordinary kind!"_"Merci, Monsieur_," she scoffed."No, it isn't _merci_, it's a fact.And he is a mighty good fellow on
whom to make an impression.""You mean, Mr.--Macloud?""For he's coming back----"

"To Hampton?""To be accurate, I expect him not later than the day-after-to-morrow.""I shall believe you, when I see him!""He is, I think, coming solely on your account.""But you're not quite sure?--oh!"Naturally, he hasn't confided in me.""So you're confiding in me--how clever!""I could tell some things----"

"Which are fables.""----but I won't--they might turn your head----"

"Which way--to the right or left?""----and make you too confident and too cruel.He saw you but
twice----"

"Once!""Once, on the street; again, when we called in the evening--but he gave
you a name, the instant he saw you----"

"How kind of him!""He called you: 'The Symphony in Blue.'""Was that the first time you had noticed it?""No, you most assuredly do not!"she said, "I know you're intrepid--but you _won't_!""Because, it would be false to your friend."Yes!--as between you two, you have renounced, in his favor.""At least, I so view it," with a teasingly fascinating smile."Don't you think that you protest over-much?""If we were two children, I'd say: 'You think you're smart, don't
you?'""And I'd retort: 'You got left, didn't you?'""Seriously, however--do you really expect Mr."I surely do--probably within two days; and I'm not chaffing when I say
that you're the inducement.So, be good to him--he's got more than
enough for two, I can assure you.""And what number am I--the twenty-first, or thereabout?""What matters it, if you're _the_ one, at present?""I'd sooner be the present one than all the has-beens," he insisted."If it will advantage any----"

"I didn't say so," she interrupted.

"----I can tell you----"

"Many fables, I don't doubt!"----that we have been rather intimate, for a few years, and I have
never before known him to exhibit particular interest in any woman.""'Why don't you speak for yourself, John,'" she quoted, merrily."Because, to be frank, I haven't enough for two," he answered, gayly.But beneath the gayety, she thought she detected the faintest note of
regret.And, woman-like, when he had gone, she wondered about her--whether she
was dark or fair, tall or small, vivacious or reserved, flirtatious or
sedate, rich or poor--and whether they loved each other--or whether it
was he, alone, who loved--or whether he had not permitted himself to be
carried so far--or whether--then, she dropped asleep.Croyden went back to Clarendon, keeping a sharp look-out for anyone
under the trees around the house.He found Moses in the library,
evidently just aroused from slumber by the master's door key."No one's bin heah, seh, 'cep de boy wid dis'spatch," he hastened to
say.Croyden tore open the envelope:--It was a wire from Macloud, that he
would be down to-morrow.yass, seh!--I'se pow'ful glad yo's back, seh.Nothin' I kin
git yo befo I goes?""You're a good soldier, Moses, you didn't
sleep on guard."I keps wide awake, Marster Croyden, wide awake all de time,
seh.Croyden finished his cigar, put out the light, and went slowly
upstairs--giving not a thought to the Parmenter treasure nor the man he
had met outside.His mind was busy with Elaine Cavendish--their last
night on the moonlit piazza--the brief farewell--the lingering pressure
of her fingers--the light in her eyes--the subdued pleasure, when they
met unexpectedly in Annapolis--her little ways to detain him, keep him
close to her--her instant defense of him at Mattison's scurrilous
insinuation--the officers' hop--the rhythmic throb of the melody--the
scented, fluttering body held close in his arms--the lowered head--the
veiled eyes--the trembling lashes--his senses steeped in the fragrance
of her beauty--the temptation well-nigh irresistible--his resolution
almost gone--trembling--trembling----

                  *       *       *       *       *

The vision passed--music ceased--the dance was ended.Sentiment
vanished--reason reigned once more.to think of her, to dream of the past, even.But
it is pleasant, sometimes, to be a fool--where a beautiful woman is
concerned, and only one's self to pay the piper.XIV

THE SYMPHONY IN BLUE


Macloud arrived the next day, bringing for his host a great batch of
mail, which had accumulated at the Club."I thought of it at the last moment--when I was starting for the
station, in fact," he remarked."The clerk said he had no instructions
for forwarding, so I just poked it in my bag and brought it along.Stupid of me not to think of it sooner.I
can understand why you didn't leave an address, but not why I shouldn't
forward it.""I didn't care, when I left--and I don't care much, now--but I'm
obliged, just the same!""It's something to do; the most
exciting incident of the day, down here, is the arrival of the mail.The people wait for it, with bated breath.I am getting in the way,
too, though I don't get much.... I never did have any extensive
correspondence, even in Northumberland--so this is just circulars and
such trash."He took the package, which Macloud handed him, and tossed it on the
desk.Everybody is
back--everybody is hard up or says he is--everybody is full of lies,
as usual, and is turning them loose on anyone who will listen,
credulous or sophisticated, it makes no difference.It's the telling,
not the believing that's the thing.the little cad Mattison is
engaged--Charlotte Brundage has landed him, and the wedding is set for
early next month.""I don't envy her the job," Croyden remarked."She'll be privileged to draw
on his bank account, and that's the all important thing with her.He
will fracture the seventh commandment, and she won't turn a hair.She
is a chilly proposition, all right.""Well, I wish her joy of her bargain," said Croyden."May she have
everything she wants, and see Mattison not at all, after the wedding
journey--and but very occasionally, then."He took up the letters and ran carelessly through them.he commented, as he consigned them, one by one,
to the waste-basket.Macloud watched him, languidly, behind his cigar smoke, and made no
comment.Presently Croyden came to a large, white envelope--darkened on the
interior so as to prevent the contents from being read until opened.It
bore the name of a firm of prominent brokers in Northumberland."'We own and offer, subject to
prior sale, the following high grade investment bonds.'He drew out the letter and looked at it,
perfunctorily, before sending it to rest with its fellows.--It wasn't
in the usual form.--He opened it, wider.--It was signed by the senior
partner.Croyden:

  "We have a customer who is interested in the Virginia Development
  Company.He has purchased the Bonds and the stock of Royster &
  Axtell, from the bank which held them as collateral.He is
  willing to pay you par for your Bonds, without any accrued
  interest, however.If you will consent to sell, the Company can
  proceed without reorganization but, if you decline, he will
  foreclose under the terms of the mortgage.We have suggested the
  propriety and the economy to him--since he owns or controls all
  the stock--of not purchasing your bonds, and, frankly, have told
  him it is worse than bad business to do so.But he refuses to be
  advised, insisting that he must be the sole owner, and that he is
  willing to submit to the additional expense rather than go
  through the tedious proceeding for foreclosure and sale.We are
  prepared to honor a sight-draft with the Bonds attached, or to
  pay cash on presentation and transfer.We shall be obliged for a
  prompt reply."Yours very truly,

                                              "R. J."What the devil!----"

He read it a second time.No, he wasn't asleep--it was all there,
typewritten and duly signed.Two hundred thousand dollars!--honor sight
draft, or pay cash on presentation and transfer!Then he passed it across to Macloud."Read this aloud, will you,--I want to see if I'm quite sane!"Macloud was at his favorite occupation--blowing smoke rings through one
another, and watching them spiral upward toward the ceiling.he said, as Croyden's words roused him from his
meditation.He and Blaxham had spent considerable time on that letter, trying to
explain the reason for the purchase, and the foolishly high price they
were offering, in such a way as to mislead Croyden."It is typewritten, you haven't a chance to get wrong!"he exclaimed.... "So, I wasn't crazy: and either
Blaxham is lying or his customer needs a guardian--which is it?""I don't see that it need concern you, in the least, which it is," said
Macloud."Be grateful for the offer--and accept by wireless or any
other way that's quicker.""But the bonds aren't worth five cents on the dollar!""So much the more reason to hustle the deal through.You may have slipped up on the Parmenter treasure, but you
have struck it here.""There's something queer about that
letter."Macloud smoked his cigar, and smiled."Blaxham's customer
may have the willies--indeed, he as much as intimates that such is the
case--but, thank God!we're not obliged to have a commission-in-lunacy
appointed on everybody who makes a silly stock or bond purchase.If we
were, we either would have no markets, or the courts would have time
for nothing else.take what the gods have given you
and be glad.You can return to
Northumberland, resume the old life, and be happy ever after;--or you
can live here, and there, and everywhere.You're unattached--not even a
light-o'-love to squander your money, and pester you for gowns and
hats, and get in a hell of a temper--and be false to you, besides.""No, I haven't one of them, thank God!""I've got
troubles enough of my own."It clears some of them away--if I take it."man, you're not thinking, seriously, of refusing?""It will put me on 'easy street,'" Croyden observed."And it comes with remarkable timeliness--so timely, indeed, as to be
suspicious.""It's a bona fide offer--there's no trouble on that score.""This," said Croyden: "I'm broke--finally.The Parmenter treasure is
moonshine, so far as I'm concerned.I'm down on my uppers, so to
speak--my only assets are some worthless bonds.along comes an
offer for them at par--two hundred thousand dollars for nothing!I
fancy, old man, there is a friend back of this offer--the only friend I
have in the world--and I did not think that even he was kind and
self-sacrificing enough to do it.--I'm grateful, Colin, grateful from
the heart, believe me, but I can't take your money."exclaimed Macloud--"you do me too much credit, Croyden.I'm
ashamed to admit it, but I never thought of the bonds, or of helping
you out, in your trouble.It's a way we have in Northumberland.We may
feel for misfortune, but it rarely gets as far as our pockets.Don't
imagine for a moment that I'm the purchaser.I'm not, though I wish,
now, that I was.""Will you give me your word on that?""I most assuredly will," Macloud answered.He looked at the
letter again.... "And, yet, it is very suspicious, very suspicious....
I wonder, could I ascertain the name of the purchaser of the stocks and
bonds, from the Trust Company who held them as collateral?""They won't know," said Macloud."Blaxham & Company bought them at the
public sale.""I could try the transfer agent, or the registrar.""They never tell anything, as you are aware," Macloud replied."I could refuse to sell unless Blaxham & Company disclosed their
customer.""Yes, you could--and, likely, lose the sale; they won't disclose.However, that's your business," Macloud observed; "though, it's a pity
to tilt at windmills, for a foolish notion."Croyden creased and uncreased the letter--thinking.Macloud resumed the smoke rings--and waited.It had proved easier than
he had anticipated.Croyden had not once thought of Elaine
Cavendish--and his simple word had been sufficient to clear
himself....

At length, Croyden put the letter back in its envelope and looked up."I'll sell the bonds," he said--"forward them at once with draft
attached, if you will witness my signature to the transfer.But it's a
queer proceeding, a queer proceeding: paying good money for bad!""That's his business--not yours," said Macloud, easily.Croyden went to the escritoire and took the bonds from one of the
drawers."You can judge, from the place I keep them, how much I thought them
worth!"When they were duly transferred and witnessed, Croyden attached a draft
drawn on an ordinary sheet of paper, dated Northumberland, and payable
to his account at the Tuscarora Trust Company.He placed them in an
envelope, sealed it and, enclosing it in a second envelope, passed it
over to Macloud."I don't care to inform them as to my whereabouts," he remarked, "so,
if you don't mind, I'll trouble you to address this to some one in New
York or Philadelphia, with a request that he mail the enclosed envelope
for you."Macloud, when he had done as requested, laid aside the pen and looked
inquiringly at Croyden."Which, being interpreted," he said, "might mean that you don't intend
to return to Northumberland.""The interpretation does not go quite so far; it means, simply, that I
have not decided.""It's a question of resolution, not of inclination," Croyden answered."I don't know whether I've sufficient resolution to go, and sufficient
resolution to stay, if I do go.It may be easier not to go, at all--to
live here, and wander, elsewhere, when the spirit moves.""I've been thinking over the proposition you
recently advanced of the folly of a relatively poor man marrying a rich
girl," he said, "and you're all wrong.It's a question of the
respective pair, not a theory that can be generalized over.I admit,
the man should not be a pauper, but, if he have enough money to support
_himself_, and the girl love him and he loves the girl, the fact that
she has gobs more money, won't send them on the rocks.It's up to the
pair, I repeat.""Meaning, that it would be up to Elaine Cavendish and me?""I wish I could be so sure," Croyden reflected."Sure of the girl, as
well as sure of myself.""What are you doubtful about--yourself?"Croyden laughed, a trifle self-consciously."I fancy I could manage myself," he said."Try her!--she's worth the try.""Get the miserable money out of your mind a moment, will you?--you're
hipped on it!""All right, old man, anything for peace!Tell me, did you see her, when
you were home?""I did--I dined with her.""You--she talked Croyden at least seven-eighths of the time; I, the
other eighth."Anything left of the
victim, afterward?""I refuse to become facetious," Macloud responded.Then he threw his
cigar into the grate and arose."It matters not what was said, nor who
said it!If you will permit me the advice, you will take your chance
while you have it.""You have--more than a chance, if you act, now----" He walked across to
the window.He would let that sink in.--"How's the Symphony in Blue?""As charming as ever--and prepared for your coming.""As charming as ever, and prepared for your coming.""I left that finality for you--being the person most interested.""When did you arrange for me to go over?""She confided in you, I suppose?""Not directly; she let me infer it.""In other words, you worked your imagination--overtime!""It's a pity you couldn't work it a bit over the Parmenter
jewels."I'm done with the Parmenter jewels!""But they're not done with you, my friend.So long as you live, they'll
be present with you.You'll be hunting for them in your dreams.""Meet me to-night in dream-land!""Well, they're not
likely to disturb my slumbers--unless--there was a rather queer thing
happened, last night, Colin.""Yes!--I got in to Hampton, in the evening; about nine o'clock, I was
returning to Clarendon when, at the gates, I was accosted by a tall,
well-dressed stranger.Here is the substance of our talk.... What do
you make of it?""It seems to me the fellow made it very plain," Macloud returned,
"except on one possible point.He evidently believes we found the
treasure.""Then, he knows that you came direct from Annapolis to Hampton--I mean,
you didn't visit a bank nor other place where you could have deposited
the jewels.Ergo, the jewels are still in your possession, according to
his theory, and he is going to make a try for them while they are
within reach.He hoped, by that
means, to induce you to keep the jewels on the premises--not to make
evidence against yourself, which could be traced by the United States,
by depositing them in any bank.""Why shouldn't I have taken them to a dealer in precious stones?""Because that would make the best sort of evidence against you.You
must remember, he thinks you have the jewels, and that you will try to
conceal it, pending a Government investigation.""You make him a very canny gentleman.""No--I make him only a clever rogue, which, by your own account, he
is.""And the more clever he is, the more he will have his wits' work for
naught.There's some compensation in everything--even in failure!""It would be a bit annoying," observed Macloud, "to be visited by
burglars, who are obsessed with the idea that you have a fortune
concealed on the premises, and are bent on obtaining it.""Annoying?--not a bit!""I should rather enjoy the
sport of putting them to flight.""Or of being bound, and gagged, and ill-treated."you've transferred your robber-barons from Northumberland to the
Eastern Shore.""The robber-barons were still on the
job in Northumberland.These are banditti, disguised as burglars, about
to hold you up for ransom.""I wish I had your fine imagination," scoffed Croyden."I could make a
fortune writing fiction.""Oh, you're not so bad yourself!""It's bully good to think you're coming back to us!""Here, Moses," said Croyden, "take this letter down to the post
office--I want it to catch the first mail.""I fancy you haven't heard of the stranger since last evening?""And of course you haven't told any one?""I suppose you even told
her the entire story--from the finding of the letter down to date.""I did!--and showed her the letter besides."No reason in the world, my dear fellow--except that in twenty-four
hours the dear public will know it, and we shall be town curiosities.""We don't have to remain," said Croyden, with affected seriousness--"there
are trains out, you know, as well as in.""I don't want to go away--I came here to visit you.""But we can't take the Symphony in Blue!"You don't think I came down here to see only
you, after having just spent nearly four weeks with you, in that fool
quest on Greenberry Point?"He turned, suddenly, and faced Croyden."Think she will retail it to the
dear public?""Because, if you do, you might mention it to her--there, she goes,
now!"said Macloud, whirling around toward the window.On the opposite side of
the street, Miss Carrington--in a tailored gown of blue broadcloth,
close fitting and short in the skirt, with a velvet toque to match--was
swinging briskly back from town.Macloud watched her a moment in silence."The old man is done for, at last!""Look at the poise of the
head, and ease of carriage, and the way she puts down her feet!--that's
the way to tell a woman."You better go over," said his friend."It's about the tea hour, she'll
brew you a cup.""And I'll drink it--as much as she will give me.I despise the stuff,
but I'll drink it!""She'll put rum in it, if you prefer!"laughed Croyden; "or make you a
high ball, or you can have it straight--just as you want.""I'll be over, presently," Croyden replied."_I_ don't want any tea,
you know.""Come along, as soon as you
wish--but don't come _too soon_."XV

AN OLD RUSE


Macloud found Miss Carrington plucking a few belated roses, which,
somehow, had escaped the frost.She looked up at his approach, and smiled--the bewilderingly bewitching
smile which lighted her whole countenance and seemed to say so much."And, if I may, to you," he replied.After them, you belong to _me_," she laughed."I don't know--it was the order of speech, and the order of
acquaintance," with a naive look."But not the order of--regard.""You did it very well for a--novice.""You decline to accept it?--Very well, sir, very well!""I can't accept, and be honest," he replied.Perchance,
you will accept a reward: a cup of tea--or a high ball!""Perchance, I will--the high ball!"She looked at him, with a sly smile."You know that I have just returned," she said."I saw you in the
window at Clarendon.""And you came over at once--prepared to be surprised that I was here.""And found you waiting for me--just as I expected."Peccavi!_" he said humbly."_Te absolvo!_" she replied, solemnly."Now, let us make a fresh
start--by going for a walk.You can postpone the high ball until we
return.""I can postpone the high ball for ever," he averred."Meaning, you could walk forever, or you're not thirsty?""Meaning, I could walk forever _with you_--on, and on, and on----"

"Until you walked into the Bay--I understand.I'll take the will for
the deed--the water's rather chilly at this season of the year."Macloud held up his hand, in mock despair."Let us make a third start--drop the attempt to be clever and talk
sense.I think I can do it, if I try."As they came out on the side walk, Croyden was going down the street."I've not forgot your admonition, so don't be uneasy," he observed to
Macloud."I'm going to town now, I'll be back in about half an hour--is
that too soon?"Miss Carrington looked at Macloud, quizzically, but made no comment."The regulation walk--to the Cemetery and back.""It's the favorite walk, here," she explained--"the most picturesque
and the smoothest.""To say nothing of accustoming the people to their future home,"
Macloud remarked."You're not used to the ways of small towns--the Cemetery is a resort,
a place to spend a while, a place to visit.""Does it make death any easier to hob-nob with it?""I shouldn't think so," she replied."However, I can see how it would
induce morbidity, though there are those who are happiest only when
they're miserable.""Such people ought to live in a morgue," agreed Macloud."However
we're safe enough--we can go to the Cemetery with impunity.""There are some rather queer old headstones, out there," she said."Remorse and the inevitable pay-up for earthly transgression seem to be
the leading subjects.There is one in the Duval lot--the Duvals from
whom Mr.Croyden got Clarendon, you know--and I never have been able to
understand just what it means.It is erected to the memory of one
Robert Parmenter, and has cut in the slab the legend: 'He feared nor
man, nor god, nor devil,' and below it, a man on his knees making
supplication to one standing over him.If he feared nor man, nor god,
nor devil, why should he be imploring mercy from any one?""Do you know who Parmenter was?""No--but I presume a connection of the family, from having been buried
with them.""You read his letter only last evening--his letter to Marmaduke
Duval.""His letter to Marmaduke Duval!""I didn't read any----"

"Robert Parmenter is the pirate who buried the treasure on Greenberry
Point," he interrupted.Then, suddenly, a light broke in on her."I see!--I didn't look at the name signed to the letter.And the
cutting on the tombstone----?""Is a victim begging mercy from him," said Macloud."I like that
Marmaduke Duval--there's something fine in a man, in those times,
bringing the old buccaneer over from Annapolis and burying him beside
the place where he, himself, some day would rest.--That is
friendship!""It was a sad day in Hampton
when the Colonel died.""He left a good deputy," Macloud replied."Croyden is well-born and
well-bred (the former does not always comprehend the latter, these
days), and of Southern blood on his mother's side.""We are a bit clannish,
still.""Delighted to hear you confess it!"Mine doesn't go so far South, however, as Croyden's--only,
to Virginia."I knew there was some reason for my liking you!""Than your Southern ancestors?--isn't that enough?""Not if there be a means to increase it.""Southern blood is never satisfied with _some_ things--it always wants
more!""Is the disposition to want more, in Southerners, confined to the male
sex?""In _some things_--yes, unquestionably yes!"Croyden told you of his experience, last
evening?""What possible danger could there be--the treasure isn't at
Clarendon.""But they think it is--and desperate men sometimes take desperate
means, when they feel sure that money is hidden on the premises.""In a town the size of Hampton, every stranger is known.""How will that advantage, in the prevention of the crime?""They don't need stay in the town--they can come in an automobile.""They could also drive, or walk, or come by boat," he added."They are not so likely to try it if there are two in the house.Do you
intend to remain at Clarendon some time?""It depends--on how you treat me.""I engage to be nice for--two weeks!""Done!--I'm booked for two weeks, at least.""And when the two weeks have expired we shall consider whether to
extend the period."She flung him a look that was delightfully alluring."Do you wish me to--consider that?""If you will," he said, bending down."This pace is getting rather
brisk--did you notice it, Mr."You're in a fast class, Miss Carrington.""Now don't misunderstand me----"

"You were speaking in the language of the race track, I presume.""A Southern girl usually loves--horses," with a tantalizing smile."It is well for you this is a public street," he said."But then if it hadn't been, you would not have ventured to tempt me,"
he added."I'm grateful for the temptation, at any rate.""No, not likely--but his first that he has resisted."The fact that we are on a public street would
not restrain you.There was absolutely no one within sight--and you
knew it.""This is rather faster than the former going!""Any way, here is
the Cemetery, and we dare not go faster than a walk in it.Yonder, just
within the gates, is the Duval burial place.Come, I'll show you
Parmenter's grave?"They crossed to it--marked by a blue slate slab, which covered it
entirely.The inscription, cut in script, was faint in places and
blurred by moss, in others.Macloud stooped and, with his knife, scratched out the latter."He died two days after the letter was written: May 12, 1738," said he.Duval did not know it, I reckon.""See, here is the picture--it stands out very plainly," said Miss
Carrington, indicating with the point of her shoe."I'm not given to moralizing, particularly over a grave," observed
Macloud, "but it's queer to think that the old pirate, who had so much
blood and death on his hands, who buried the treasure, and who wrote
the letter, lies at our feet; and we--or rather Croyden is the heir of
that treasure, and that we searched and dug all over Greenberry Point,
committed violence, were threatened with violence, did things
surreptitiously, are threatened, anew, with blackmail and
violence----"

"Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways," she quoted."It does seem one cannot get away from its pollution.It was gathered
in crime and crime clings to it, still.However, I fancy Croyden would
willingly chance the danger, if he could unearth the casket.""And is there no hope of finding it?""Absolutely none--there's half a million over on Greenberry Point, or
in the water close by, and none will ever see it--except by accident.""My own idea--and Croyden's (as he has,
doubtless, explained to you) is that the place, where Parmenter buried
the jewels, is now under water, possibly close to the shore.We dragged
every inch of the bottom, which has been washed away to a depth more
than sufficient to uncover the iron box, but found nothing.A great
storm, such as they say sometimes breaks over the Chesapeake, may wash
it on the beach--that, I think, is the only way it will ever be
found.... It makes everything seem very real to have stood by
Parmenter's grave!"he said, thoughtful, as they turned back toward
town.On nearing the Carrington house, they saw Croyden approaching."I've been communing with Parmenter," said Macloud."I didn't know there was a spiritualistic medium in Hampton!"Well, did he help you to locate his jewel box?""He wasn't especially communicative--he was in his grave.""That isn't surprising--he's been dead something over one hundred and
seventy years."He's buried with the Duvals in the Cemetery, here."one more circumstance to prove the
letter speaks the truth.We find his
will, probated with Marmaduke Duval as executor, we even discover a
notice of his death in the _Gazette_, and now, finally, you find his
body--or the place of its interment!what is really
worth while, we can't find.""Come into the house--I'll give you something to soothe your feelings
temporarily," said Miss Carrington.They encountered Miss Erskine just coming from the library on her way
to the door."My dear Davila, so glad to see you!"Croyden,
we thought you had deserted us, and just when we're trying to make you
feel at home."I'm delighted to be back," said Croyden."The Carringtons seemed
genuinely glad to see me--and, now, if I may include you, I'm quite
content to return," and he shook her hand, as though he meant it."Of course you may believe it," with an inane giggle."I'm going to
bring my art class over to Clarendon to revel in your treasures, some
day, soon.You'll be at home to them, won't you, dear Mr.I shall take pleasure in being at home," Croyden replied,
soberly.Then Macloud, who was talking with the Captain, was called over and
presented, that being, Miss Carrington thought, the quickest method of
getting rid of her.The evident intention to remain until he was
presented, being made entirely obvious by Miss Erskine, who, after she
had bubbled a bit more, departed."What is her name, I didn't catch it?--and" (observing smiles on
Croyden and Miss Carrington's faces) "what is she?""I think father can explain, in more appropriate language!""She's the most intolerable nuisance and greatest fool in Hampton!""A red flag to a bull isn't in it with Miss Erskine and father," Miss
Carrington observed."But I hide it pretty well--while she's here," he protested."If she's not here too long--and you can get away, in time."When the two men left the Carrington place, darkness had fallen.As
they approached Clarendon, the welcoming brightness of a well-lighted
house sprang out to greet them.It was Croyden's one extravagance--to
have plenty of illumination.He had always been accustomed to it, and
the gloom, at night, of the village residence, bright only in library
or living room--with, maybe, a timid taper in the hall--set his nerves
on edge.And Moses, with considerable wonder
at, to his mind, the waste of gas, and much grumbling to himself and
Josephine, obeyed.They had finished dinner and were smoking their cigars in the library,
when Croyden, suddenly bethinking himself of a matter which he had
forgotten, arose and pulled the bell.said old Mose a moment later from the doorway."Moses, who is the best carpenter in town?""Mistah Snyder, seh--he wuz heah dis arfternoon, yo knows, seh!""I didn't know it," said Croyden."Why yo sont 'im, seh.""Dat's mons'us 'culiar, seh--he said yo sont 'im.He com'd 'torrectly
arfter yo lef!Him an' a'nudder man, seh--I didn't know the nudder man,
hows'ever.""Dey sed yo warn dem to look over all de place, seh, an' see what
repairs wuz necessary, and fix dem.Dey wuz heah a'most two hours, I
s'pose.""Do you mean they were
in this house for two hours?"I didn't stays wid em, seh--I knows
Mistah Snyder well; he's bin heah off'n to wuk befo' yo cum, seh.But I
seed dem gwine th'oo de drawers, an' poundin on the floohs, seh.Dey
went down to de cellar, too, seh, an wuz dyar quite a while."seh, don't you t'inks I knows 'im?I knows 'im from de time
he wuz so high.""Go down and tell Snyder I want to see him, either
to-night or in the morning."The <DW64> bowed, and departed.Croyden got up and went to the escritoire: the drawers were in
confusion.He glanced at the book-cases: the books were disarranged.He
turned and looked, questioningly, at Macloud--and a smile slowly
overspread his face."Well, the tall gentleman has visited us!""I wondered how long you would be coming to it!""It's the old ruse, in a slightly modified form.Instead of a
telephone or gas inspector, it was a workman whom the servant knew; a
little more trouble in disguising himself, but vastly more satisfactory
in results.""They are clever rogues," said Croyden--"and the disguise must have
been pretty accurate to deceive Moses.""Disguise is their business," Macloud replied, laconically."If they're
not proficient in it, they go to prison--sure.""And if they _are_ proficient, they go--sometimes.""We'll make a tour of inspection--they couldn't find what they wanted,
so we'll see what they took."Every drawer was turned upside down, every
closet awry, every place, where the jewels could be concealed, bore
evidence of having been inspected--nothing, apparently, had been
missed.They had gone through the house completely, even into the
garret, where every board that was loose had evidently been taken up
and replaced--some of them carelessly.Not a thing was gone, so far as Croyden could judge--possibly, because
there was no money in the house; probably, because they were looking
for jewels, and scorned anything of moderate value."Really, this thing grows interesting--if it were not so ridiculous,"
said Croyden."I'm willing to go to almost any trouble to convince them
I haven't the treasure--just to be rid of them."Abduction, maybe," Macloud suggested."Some night a black cloth will
be thrown over your head, you'll be tossed into a cab--I mean, an
automobile--and borne off for ransom like Charlie Ross of fading
memory.""Moral--don't venture out after sunset!""And don't venture out at any time without a revolver handy and a good
pair of legs," added Macloud."I can work the legs better than I can the revolver.""Or, to make sure, you might have a guard of honor and a gatling gun.""You're appointed to the position--provide yourself with the gun!"said Macloud, "it would be well to take some
precaution.They seem obsessed with the idea that you have the jewels,
here--and they evidently intend to get a share, if it's possible."Macloud shrugged his shoulders, helplessly.XVI

THE MARABOU MUFF


The next two weeks passed uneventfully.The thieves did not manifest
themselves, and the Government authorities did nothing to suggest that
they had been informed of the Parmenter treasure.Macloud had developed an increasing fondness for Miss Carrington's
society, which she, on her part, seemed to accept with placid
equanimity.They rode, they drove, they walked, they sailed when the
weather warranted--and the weather had recovered from its fit of the
blues, and was lazy and warm and languid.In short, they did everything
which is commonly supposed to denote a growing fondness for each
other.Croyden had been paid promptly for the Virginia Development Company
bonds, and was once more on "comfortable street," as he expressed it.But he spoke no word of returning to Northumberland.On the contrary,
he settled down to enjoy the life of the village, social and otherwise.He was nice to all the girls, but showed a marked preference for Miss
Carrington; which, however, did not trouble his friend, in the least.Macloud was quite willing to run the risk with Croyden.He was
confident that the call of the old life, the memory of the girl that
was, and that was still, would be enough to hold Geoffrey from more
than firm friendship.He was not quite sure of himself, however--that
he wanted to marry.And he was entirely sure she had not decided
whether she wanted him--that was what gave him his lease of life; if
she decided _for_ him, he knew that he would decide for her--and
quickly.Then, one day, came a letter--forwarded by the Club, where he had left
his address with instructions that it be divulged to no one.It was
dated Northumberland, and read:

  "My dear Colin--

  "It is useless, between us, to dissemble, and I'm not going to
  try it.I want to know whether Geoffrey Croyden is coming back to
  Northumberland?If he is not
  coming and there is no one else--won't you tell me where you are?(I don't ask you to reveal his address, you see.)I shall come
  down--if only for an hour, between trains--and give him his
  chance.It is radically improper, according to accepted
  notions--but notions don't bother me, when they stand (as I am
  sure they do, in this case), in the way of happiness."Sincerely,

                                           "Elaine Cavendish."At dinner, Macloud casually remarked:

"I ought to go out to Northumberland, this week, for a short time,
won't you go along?""I'm not going back to Northumberland," he said."I'll promise to come back
with you in two days at the most.""You can easily find your
way back.For me, it's easier to stay away from Northumberland, than to
go away from it, _again_."And Macloud, being wise, dropped the conversation, saying only:

"Well, I may not have to go."A little later, as he sat in the drawing-room at Carringtons', he
broached a matter which had been on his mind for some time--working
around to it gradually, with Croyden the burden of their talk.When his
opportunity came--as it was bound to do--he took it without
hesitation."Croyden had two reasons for leaving
Northumberland: one of them has been eliminated; the other is stronger
than ever.""A woman who has plenty of money--more than she can ever
spend, indeed.""What was the
trouble--wouldn't she have him?""Her money--she has so much!--So much, that, in comparison, he is a
mere pauper:--twenty millions against two hundred thousand.""If she be willing, I can't see why he is shy?""He says it is all right for a poor girl to marry a rich man, but not
for a poor man to marry a rich girl.His idea is, that the husband
should be able to maintain his wife according to her condition.To
marry else, he says, is giving hostages to fortune, and is derogatory
to that mutual respect which should exist between them.""We all give hostages to fortune when we marry!""What is it you want me to do?"she asked hastily--"or can I do
anything?""You can ask Miss Cavendish to visit you for a
few days.""Can you, by any possibility, mean Elaine Cavendish?""That's exactly who I do mean--do you know her?""After a fashion--we went to Dobbs Ferry together.""She will think it a trifle peculiar.""On the contrary, she'll think it more than kind--a positive favor.You
see, she knows I'm with Croyden, but she doesn't know where; so she
wrote to me at my Club and they forwarded it.Croyden left
Northumberland without a word--and no one is aware of his residence but
me.She asks that I tell her where _I_ am.Then she intends to come
down and give Croyden a last chance.I want to help her--and your
invitation will be right to the point--she'll jump at it.""Come, we'll work out the letter
together.""Would I not be permitted to kiss you as Miss Cavendish's deputy?""Miss Cavendish can be her own deputy," she answered.--"Moreover, it
would be premature."The second morning after, when Elaine Cavendish's maid brought her
breakfast, Miss Carrington's letter was on the tray among tradesmen's
circulars, invitations, and friendly correspondence.She did not recognize the handwriting, and the postmark was unfamiliar,
wherefore, coupled with the fact that it was addressed in a
particularly stylish hand, she opened it first.It was very brief, very
succinct, very informing, and very satisfactory."Ashburton,

                             "Hampton, Md."My dear Elaine:--

  "Mr.Macloud tells me you are contemplating coming down to the
  Eastern Shore to look for a country-place.Let me advise
  Hampton--there are some delightful old residences in this
  vicinity which positively are crying for a purchaser.Geoffrey
  Croyden, whom you know, I believe, is resident here, and is
  thinking of making it his home permanently.If you can be
  persuaded to come, you are to stay with me--the hotels are simply
  impossible, and I shall be more than delighted to have you.We
  can talk over old times at Dobbs, and have a nice little visit
  together.Don't trouble to write--just wire the time of your
  arrival--and come before the good weather departs."With lots of love,

                                          "Davila Carrington."Elaine Cavendish read the letter slowly--and smiled."Colin is rather a diplomat--he
managed it with exceeding adroitness--and the letter is admirably
worded.I'd forgotten about
Davila Carrington, and I reckon she had forgotten me, till he somehow
found it out and jogged her memory.She went to her desk and wrote this wire,
in answer:

  "Miss Davila Carrington,

       "Hampton, Md."I shall be with you Friday, on morning train.Miss Carrington showed the wire to Macloud."Now, I've done all that I can; the rest is in your hands," she said."I'll cooperate, but you are the general.""Until Elaine comes--she will manage it then," Macloud answered.And on Friday morning, a little before noon, Miss Cavendish arrived.Miss Carrington, alone, met her at the station."You're just the same Davila I'd forgotten for years," said she,
laughingly, as they walked across the platform to the waiting carriage."And you're the same I had forgotten," Davila replied."And it's just as delightful to be able to remember," was the reply.Just after they left the business section, on the drive out, Miss
Carrington saw Croyden and Macloud coming down the street.Evidently
Macloud had not been able to detain him at home until she got her
charge safely into Ashburton.She glanced at Miss Cavendish--she had
seen them, also, and, settling back into the corner of the phaeton, she
hid her face with her Marabou muff.as both men raised their
hats--and drove straight on."Who was the girl with Miss Carrington?""I noticed a bag in the trap,
however, so I reckon she's a guest.""Your opportunity, for the
solitariness of two, will be limited."It depends on what she is--I'm not
sacrificing myself on the altar of general unattractiveness.""Rest easy, I'll fuss her to the limit.You shan't have her to
plead for an excuse."I'm not worried about the guest," Macloud
remarked."There was a certain style about as much of her as I could see which
promised very well," Croyden remarked."I think this would be a good
day to drop in for tea.""And if you find her something over sixty, you'll gallantly shove her
off on me, and preempt Miss Carrington."She's not over sixty--and you know it.You're by no means as blind as
you would have me believe.In fact, now that I think of it, there was
something about her that seems familiar.""You're an adept in many things," laughed Macloud, "but, I reckon,
you're not up to recognizing a brown coat and a brown hat.I think I've
seen the combination once or twice before on a woman.""Well, what about tea-time--shall we go over?""I haven't the slightest objection----"

"Really!""----to your going along with me--I'm expected!"pretty soon it will be: 'Come over and
see us, won't you?'""I trust so," said Macloud, placidly.--"But, as you're never coming
back to Northumberland, it's a bit impossible.""I've a faint recollection of having heard that remark before.""I dare say, it's popular there on smoky days.""Which is the same as saying it's popular there any time.""No, I don't mean that; Northumberland isn't half so bad as it's
painted.We may make fun of it--but we like it, just the same.""Yes, I suppose we do," said Macloud."Though we get mighty sick of
seeing every scatterbrain who sets fire to the Great White Way branded
by the newspapers as a Northumberland millionaire.We've got our share
of fools, but we haven't a monopoly of them, by any means.""We had a marvelously large crop, however, running loose at one time,
recently!""True!--and there's the reason for it, as well as the fallacy.Because
half a hundred light-weights were made millionaires over night, and,
top heavy, straightway went the devil's pace, doesn't imply that the
entire town is mad.""It's no worse than any other big town--and
the fellows with unsavory reputations aren't representative.They just
came all in a bunch.The misfortune is, that the whole country saw the
fireworks, and it hasn't forgot the lurid display.""And isn't likely to very soon," Macloud responded, "with the whole
Municipal Government rotten to the core, councilmen falling over one
another in their eagerness to plead _nolle contendere_ and escape the
penitentiary, bankers in jail for bribery, or fighting extradition; and
graft!permeating every department of the civic life--and
published by the newspapers' broadcast, through the land, for all the
world to read, while the people, as a body, sit supine, and meekly
suffer the robbers to remain.The trouble with the Northumberlander is,
that so long as he is not the immediate victim of a hold up, he is
quiescent.Let him be touched direct--by burglary, by theft, by
embezzlement--and the yell he lets out wakes the entire bailiwick.""It's the same everywhere," said Croyden."No, it's not,--other communities have waked up--Northumberland hasn't.There is too much of the moneyed interest to be looked after; and the
councilmen know it, and are out for the stuff, as brazen as the
street-walker, and vastly more insistent.--I'm going in here, for some
cigarettes--when I come out, we'll change the talk to something less
irritating.I like Northumberland, but I despise about ninety-nine one
hundredths of its inhabitants."When he returned, Croyden was gazing after an automobile which was
disappearing in a cloud of dust."The fellow driving, unless I am mightily
fooled, is the same who stopped me on the street, in front of
Clarendon," he said."That's interesting--any one with him?""He isn't travelling around with
a petticoat--at least, if he's thinking of tackling you.""It isn't likely, I admit--but suppose he is?""He is leaving here as fast as the wheels will turn.""I've got a very accurate memory for faces," said Croyden.If it was he, and he has some new scheme, it will be
declared in due time.So long as they think you have the jewels, they will try
for them.There's Captain Carrington standing at his office door."Sitting up to grandfather-in-law!""Distinctly
proper, sir, distinctly proper!Go and chat with him; I'll stop for
you, presently."*       *       *       *       *

Meanwhile, the two women had continued on to Ashburton.Elaine asked, dropping her muff from before her
face, when they were past the two men."It would make a difference in my--attitude toward him when we met!"The
fact that Croyden did not come out and stop them, that he let them go
on, was sufficient proof that he had not recognized her."You see, I am assuming that you know why I wanted to come to Hampton,"
Elaine said, when, her greeting made to Mrs.Carrington, she had
carried Davila along to her room."And you made it very easy for me to come.""I did as I thought you would want--and as I know you would do with me
were I in a similar position.""I'm sadly afraid I should not have thought of you, were you----"

"Oh, yes, you would!If you had been in a small town, and Mr.Croyden
had told you of my difficulty----"

"As _Mr.Macloud_ told you of mine--I see, dear.""Not exactly that," said Davila, blushing.Macloud has been very
attentive and very nice and all that, you know, but you mustn't forget
there are not many girls here, and I'm convenient, and--I don't take
him seriously.""I don't know--sometimes I think he does, and sometimes I think he
doesn't!""He is an accomplished flirt and difficult to
gauge.""Well, let me tell you one fact, for your information: there isn't a
more indifferent man in Northumberland.He goes everywhere, is in great
demand, is enormously popular, yet, I've never known him to have even
an affair.He is armor-plated--but he is a dear, a perfect dear,
Davila!"she said, with heightening color--and Elaine said no more,
then.Croyden alone, for the first time, or in
company?""I confess I don't know, but I think, however, it would be better to
have a few words with Colin, first--if it can be arranged."Macloud is to come in a moment before
luncheon, if he can find an excuse that will not include Mr."Is an excuse difficult to find--or is any, even, needed?""He doesn't usually come before four--that's the tea hour in Hampton.""If you've got him into the tea habit, you can
do what you want with him--he will eat out of your hand.""I never tried him with tea," said Davila."He chose a high ball the
first time--so it's been a high ball ever since."Elaine sat down on the couch and put her arm about Davila."But we shall be good friends, better
friends than ever, Davila, when you come to Northumberland to live.""That is just the question, Elaine," was the quick answer; "whether I
shall be given the opportunity, and whether I shall take it, if I am.I
haven't let it go so far, because I don't feel sure of him.Until I do,
I intend to keep tight hold on myself."Just before luncheon, Macloud arrived."I'm glad to see
you here.""Yes, I'm here, thanks to you," said Elaine--and Davila not being
present, she kissed him."No--but I wish the other--would, too!""You're not wont to be so timid," she returned."I wish I had some of your bravery," he said."Isn't it impetuous womanliness."There isn't a doubt as to his feelings.""But there is a doubt as to his letting them control--I see."And you alone can help him solve it--if any one can.And I have
great hopes, Elaine, great hopes!""How any chap could resist you is inconceivable--I could not.""You could not at one time, you mean.""You gave me no encouragement,--so I must, perforce, fare elsewhere.""How many love affairs have you come down here to settle?""By the way, Croyden is impatient to come over this afternoon.The
guest in the trap with Miss Carrington has aroused his curiosity.He
could see only a long brown coat and a brown hat, but the muff before
your face, and his imagination, did the rest."It's simply the country town beginning to tell
on him.He is curious about new guests, and Miss Carrington hadn't
mentioned your coming!He suggested, in a vague sort of way, that there
was something familiar about you, but he didn't attempt to
particularize."I think not--we shall all be present.""And _how_ shall you meet him?""I reckon you don't know much about it--haven't any plans?"He will know why I'm
here, and whether he is glad or sorry or displeased at my coming, I
shall know instantly.It's absurd, this
notion of his, and why let it rule him and me!I've always got what I
wanted, and I'm going to get Geoffrey.A Queen of a Nation must propose
to a suitor, so why not a Queen of Money to a man less rich than
she--especially when she is convinced that that alone keeps them apart.I shall give him a chance to propose to me first; several chances,
indeed!""Then, if he doesn't respond--I shall do it
myself."XVII

A HANDKERCHIEF AND A GLOVE


Miss Cavendish was standing behind the curtains in the window of her
room, when Croyden and Macloud came up the walk, at four o'clock.She was waiting!--not another touch to be given to her attire.Her
gown, of shimmering blue silk, clung to her figure with every movement,
and fell to the floor in suggestively revealing folds.Her dark hair
was arranged in simple fashion--the simplicity of exquisite
taste--making the fair face below it, seem fairer even than it was.She heard them enter the lower hall, and pass into the drawing-room.She glided out to the stairway, and stood, peering down over the
balustrade.She heard Miss Carrington's greeting and theirs--heard
Macloud's chuckle, and Croyden's quiet laugh.Then she heard Macloud
say:

"Mr.Croyden is anxious to meet your guest--at least, we took her to be
a guest you were driving with this morning.""My guest is equally anxious to meet Mr.Croyden," Miss Carrington
replied."Did you ever know a woman to be ready?"Croyden imagined there was something familiar about her," Macloud
remarked.(Elaine strained her ears to catch his answer.)"She didn't let me have the chance to recognize her," said he--"she
wouldn't let me see her face."(Elaine gave a little sigh of relief.)"She couldn't have covered it completely--she saw you.""She can't--I'm on the pinnacle of expectation, now.""Humpty-Dumpty risks a great fall!""If the guest doesn't please me, I'm going
to talk to Miss Carrington.""You're growing blase," she warned."If it is, I know one who must
be too blase even to move," with a meaning glance at Macloud.A light foot-fall on the stairs, the soft swish of skirts in the
hallway, Croyden turned, expectantly--and Miss Cavendish entered the
room.Croyden's from astonishment; the
others' with watching him.Elaine's eyes were intent on Croyden's face--and what she saw there
gave her great content: he might not be persuaded, but he loved her,
and he would not misunderstand.Her face brightened with a fascinating
smile."You are surprised to see me, messieurs?"Croyden's eyes turned quickly to his friend, and back again."I'm not so sure as to Monsieur Macloud," he said."Surprised is quite too light a word--stunned would but meekly express
it.""Did neither of you ever hear me mention Miss Carrington?--We were
friends, almost chums, at Dobbs Ferry.""If I did, it has escaped me?""Well, you're likely not to forget it again.""Did you know that I--that we were here?"I knew that you and Colin were both here," Elaine replied,
imperturbably."Do you think yourself so unimportant as not to be
mentioned by Miss Carrington?""What will you have to drink, Mr.she asked--while Elaine and Macloud
laughed."You said you would take a _sour_ ball."A man who mixes a
high ball with a sour ball is either rattled or drunk, I am not the
latter, therefore----"

"You mean that my coming has rattled you?""Yes--I'm rattled for very joy.""You could spare a few--and not miss them!"said Macloud, handing him the glass."Sweetened by your touch, I suppose!"By the ladies' presence--God save them!""Colin," said Croyden, as, an hour later, they walked back to
Clarendon, "you should have told me.""Don't affect ignorance, old man--you knew Elaine was coming.""And that it was she in the trap.""The muff hid her face from me, too.""Do you think it was wise to let her come?""I had nothing to do with her decision.Miss Carrington asked her, she
accepted.""Didn't you give her my address?"Croyden looked at him, doubtfully."I'm telling you the truth," said Macloud."She tried to get your
address, when I was last in Northumberland, and I refused.""And then, she stumbles on it through Davila Carrington!I reckon, if I went off into some deserted spot in Africa, it
wouldn't be a month until some fellow I knew, or who knows a mutual
friend, would come nosing around, and blow on me."I'm not sorry she came--at least, not now, since she's here.--I'll
be sorry enough when she goes, however.""I must--it's the only proper thing to do.""Would it not be better that _she_ should decide what is proper for
her?""Based on your peculiar notion of relative wealth between husband and
wife--without regard to what she may think on the subject.In other
words, have you any right to decline the risk, if she is willing to
undertake it?"Her income, for three
months, about equals my entire fortune.""And live at the rate of pretty near two hundred thousand dollars a
year?""I think I could, if I loved the girl.""And suffer in your self-respect forever after?"If you
play _your_ part, you won't lose your self-respect.""It is a trifle difficult to do--to play my part, when all the world is
saying, 'he married her for her money,' and shows me scant regard in
consequence.""Why the devil need you care what the world says!""I don't--the world may go hang.But the question is, how long can the
man retain the woman's esteem, with such a handicap.""It depends entirely on yourself.--If you start with it, you can hold
it, if you take the trouble to try."Croyden laughed, as they entered
Clarendon."Just what I should like to know----"

"Well, I'll tell you what you are if you don't marry Elaine Cavendish,"
Macloud interrupted--"You're an unmitigated fool!""Assuming that Miss Cavendish would marry me.""You're not likely to marry her, otherwise," retorted Macloud, as he
went up the stairs.On the landing he halted and looked down at Croyden
in the hall below."And if you don't take your chance, the chance she
has deliberately offered you by coming to Hampton, you are worse
than----" and, with an expressive gesture, he resumed the ascent."How do you know she came down here just for that purpose?"But all that came back in answer, as Macloud went down the hall and
into his room, was the whistled air from a popular opera, then running
in the Metropolis."Ev'ry little movement has a meaning all its own,
          Ev'ry thought and action----"

The door slammed--the music ceased."I won't believe it," Croyden reflected, "that Elaine would do anything
so utterly unconventional as to seek me out deliberately.... I might
have had a chance if--Oh, damn it all!why didn't we find the old
pirate's box--it would have clarified the whole situation."As he changed into his evening clothes, he went over the matter,
carefully, and laid out the line of conduct that he intended to
follow.He would that Elaine had stayed away from Hampton.It was putting him
to too severe a test--to be with her, to be subject to her alluring
loveliness, and, yet, to be unmoved.It is hard to see the luscious
fruit within one's reach and to refrain from even touching it.It grew
harder the more he contemplated it....

"It's no use fighting against it, here!"he exclaimed, going into
Macloud's room, and throwing himself on a chair."I'm going to cut the
whole thing."Macloud inquired, pausing with
his waistcoat half on."What the devil do you think I'm talking about?""Not being a success at solving riddles, I give it up.""Can you comprehend this:--I'm going to
leave town?""He is coming to it, at last," he thought.What he said was:--"You're
not going to be put to flight by a woman?""I am.--If I stay here I shall lose.""Most people would not call that _losing_," said Macloud."I have nothing to do with most people--only, with myself.""It seems so!--even Elaine isn't to be considered.""Haven't we gone over all that?""I don't know--but, if we have, go over it again.""You assume she came down here solely on my account--because I'm
here?""I assume nothing," Macloud answered, with a quiet chuckle."I said you
have a chance, and urged you not to let it slip.I should not have
offered any suggestion--I admit that----"

"Oh, bosh!""Don't be so humble--you're rather
proud of your interference."I'm only sorry it is so unavailing.""You did!--or, at least, I inferred as much.""I'm not responsible for your inferences."Nothing!--not even for my resolution--I haven't any--I can't
make any that holds.Desire clamors for me to stay--to hasten over to Ashburton--to
put it to the test.When I get to Ashburton, common sense will be in
control.When I come away, desire will tug me back, again--and so on,
and so on--and so on.""You need a cock-tail, instead
of a weather-cock.if we are to dine at the Carringtons' at
seven, we would better be moving.Having thrown the blue funk, usual to
a man in your position, you'll now settle down to business.""Let future events determine--take it as it comes," Macloud urged."If I let future events
decide for me, the end's already fixed."The big clock on the landing was chiming seven when they rang the bell
at Ashburton and the maid ushered them into the drawing-room.Carrington was out of town, visiting in an adjoining county, and the
Captain had not appeared.He came down stairs a moment later, and took
Macloud and Croyden over to the library.After about a quarter of an hour, he glanced at his watch a trifle
impatiently.--Another fifteen minutes, and he glanced at it again.he called, as the maid passed the door."Go up to Miss
Davila's room and tell her it's half-after-seven."Then he continued with the story he was relating.Presently, the maid returned; the Captain looked at her,
interrogatingly."Mis' Davila, she ain' deah, no seh," said the girl."She is probably in Miss Cavendish's room,--look, there, for her," the
Captain directed.I looks dyar--she ain' no place up stairs, and neither is
Mis' Cav'dish, seh.Hit's all dark, in dey rooms, seh, all dark.""Half-after-seven, and not here?""They were here, two hours ago," said Croyden."Find out from the other servants whether they left any word."excuse me, sirs, I'll try to locate them."He went to the telephone, and called up the Lashiels, the Tilghmans,
the Tayloes, and all their neighbors and intimates, only to receive the
same answer: "They were not there, and hadn't been there that
afternoon.""We are at your service, Captain Carrington," said Macloud
instantly.--"At your service for anything we can do.""They knew, of course, you were expected for dinner?"he asked, as he
led the way upstairs.--"I can't account for it."The Captain inspected his granddaughter's and Miss Cavendish's rooms,
Macloud and Croyden, being discreet, the rooms on the other side of the
house."We will have dinner," said the Captain."They will surely turn up
before we have finished."The dinner ended, however, and the missing ones had not returned."Might they have gone for a drive?""The keys of the stable are on my desk,
which shows that the horses are in for the night.I admit I am at a
loss--however, I reckon they will be in presently, with an explanation
and a good laugh at us for being anxious."But when nine o'clock came, and then half-after-nine, and still they
did not appear, the men grew seriously alarmed.The Captain had recourse to the telephone again, getting residence
after residence, without result."I don't know what to make of it," he said, bewildered."I've called
every place I can think of, and I can't locate them."Let us see how the matter stands," said Macloud."We left them here
about half-after-five, and, so far as can be ascertained, no one has
seen them since.Consequently, they must have gone out for a walk or a
drive.A drive is most unlikely, at this time of the day--it is dark
and cold.Furthermore, your horses are in the stable, so, if they went,
they didn't go alone--some one drove them.The alternative--a walk--is
the probable explanation; and that remits us to an accident as the
cause of delay.Which, it seems to me, is the likely explanation.""But if there were an accident, they would have been discovered, long
since; the walks are not deserted," the Captain objected."Possibly, they went out of the town.""A young woman never goes out of town, unescorted," was the decisive
answer."This is a Southern town, you know.""I suppose you don't care to telephone the police?""No--not yet," the Captain replied."Davila would never forgive me, if
nothing really were wrong--besides, I couldn't.The Mayor's office is
closed for the night--we're not supposed to need the police after six
o'clock.""Then Croyden and I will patrol the roads, hereabout," said Macloud.I will go out the Queen Street pike a mile or two," the Captain
said.Croyden can take the King Street pike, North and
South.We'll meet here not later than eleven o'clock.Excuse me a
moment----"

"What do you make of it?""It is either very serious or else it's nothing at all.I mean, if
anything _has_ happened, it's far out of the ordinary," Croyden
answered."Exactly my idea--though, I confess, I haven't a notion what the
serious side could be.It's safe to assume that they didn't go into the
country--the hour, alone, would have deterred them, even if the danger
from the <DW64> were not present, constantly, in Miss Carrington's mind.On the other hand, how could anything have happened in the town which
would prevent one of them from telephoning, or sending a message, or
getting some sort of word to the Captain.""It's all very mysterious--yet, I dare say, easy of solution and
explanation.There isn't any danger of the one thing that is really
terrifying, so I'm not inclined to be alarmed, unduly--just
disquieted."take these," he said, giving each a revolver."Let us hope there
won't be any occasion to use them, but it is well to be prepared."They went out together--at the intersection of Queen and King Streets,
they parted.eleven o'clock at my house," said the Captain."If any one
of us isn't there, the other two will know he needs assistance."It was a chilly November night, with
frost in the air.The moon, in its second quarter and about to sink
into the waters of the Bay, gave light sufficient to make walking easy,
where the useless street lamps did not kill it with their timid
brilliancy.He passed the limits of the town, and struck out into the
country.It had just struck ten, when they parted--he would walk for
half an hour, and then return.He could do three miles--a mile and a
half each way--and still be at the Carrington house by eleven.He
proceeded along the east side of the road, his eyes busy lest, in the
uncertain light, he miss anything which might serve as a clue.For the
allotted time, he searched but found nothing--he must return.He
crossed to the west side of the road, and faced homeward.A mile passed--a quarter more was added--the feeble lights of the town
were gleaming dimly in the fore, when, beside the track, he noticed a
small white object.It was a woman's handkerchief, and, as he picked it up, a faint odor of
violets was clinging to it still.Here might be a clue--there was a
monogram on the corner, but he could not distinguish it, in the
darkness.He put it in his pocket and hastened on.A hundred feet
farther, and his foot hit something soft.He groped about, with his
hands, and found--a woman's glove.It, also, bore the odor of violets.At the first lamp-post, he stopped and examined the handkerchief--the
monogram was plain: E.C.--and violets, he remembered, were her
favorite perfume.He took out the glove--a soft, undressed kid
affair--but there was no mark on it to help him.He pushed the feminine trifles back
into his pocket, and hurried on.He was late, and when he arrived at Ashburton, Captain Carrington and
Macloud were just about to start in pursuit.he said, tossing the glove and the handkerchief on the
table--"on the west side of the road, about half a mile from town.""The violets are familiar--and the handkerchief is Elaine's," said he."I'm going to call in our friends," he said.XVIII

THE LONE HOUSE BY THE BAY


When Croyden and Macloud left the Carrington residence that evening,
after their call and tea, Elaine and Davila remained for a little while
in the drawing-room rehearsing the events of the day, as women will.Presently, Davila went over to draw the shades."What do you say to a walk before we dress for dinner?""I should like it, immensely," Elaine answered.They went upstairs, changed quickly to street attire, and set out."We will go down to the centre of the town and back," said Davila."It's about half a mile each way, and there isn't any danger, so long
as you keep in the town.I shouldn't venture beyond it unescorted,
however, even in daylight."It's the curse that hangs over the South
since the Civil War: the <DW64>.""I don't mean that all black men are bad, for they are not.Many are
entirely trustworthy, but the trustworthy ones are much, very much, in
the minority.The vast majority are worthless--and a worthless <DW65>
is the worst thing on earth.""I think I prefer only the lighted streets," Elaine remarked."And you will be perfectly safe there," Davila replied.They swung briskly along to the centre of the town--where the two main
thoroughfares, King and Queen Streets, met each other in a wide circle
that, after the fashion of Southern towns, was known, incongruously
enough, as "The Diamond."Passing around this circle, they retraced
their steps toward home.As they neared Ashburton, an automobile with the top up and side
curtains on shot up behind them, hesitated a moment, as though
uncertain of its destination and then drew up before the Carrington
place.Two men alighted, gave an order to the driver, and went across
the pavement to the gate, while the engine throbbed, softly.Then they seemed to notice the women approaching, and stepping back
from the gate, they waited.said one, raising his hat and bowing, "can you
tell me if this is where Captain Carrington lives?"said the man, standing aside to let them pass."I am Miss Carrington--whom do you wish to see?""Captain Carrington, is he at home?""I do not know--if you will come in, I'll inquire."Davila thanked him with a smile,
and she and Elaine went in, leaving the strangers to follow.The next instant, each girl was struggling in the folds of a shawl,
which had been flung over her from behind and wrapped securely around
her head and arms, smothering her cries to a mere whisper.In a trice,
despite their struggles--which, with heads covered and arms held close
to their sides, were utterly unavailing--they were caught up, tossed
into the tonneau, and the car shot swiftly away.In a moment, it was clear of the town, the driver "opened her up," and
they sped through the country at thirty miles an hour."Better give them some air," said the leader."It doesn't matter how
much they yell here."He had been holding Elaine on his lap, his arms keeping the shawl tight
around her.Now he loosed her, and unwound the folds."You will please pardon the liberty we have taken," he said, as he
freed her, "but there are----"

Crack!Elaine had struck him straight in the face with all her strength, and,
springing free, was on the point of leaping out, when he seized her
and forced her back, caught her arms in the shawl, which was still
around her, and bound them tight to her side."I got an upper cut on the
jaw that made me see stars.""I've been very easy with mine," his companion returned.However, he took care not to loosen the shawl from her
arms."There you are, my lady, I hope you've not been greatly
inconvenienced.""Don't forget, Bill!--mum's the word!""At least, you can permit us to sit on the floor of the car," said
Elaine."Whatever may be your scheme, it's scarcely necessary to hold
us in this disgusting position.""I reckon that is a trifle overstated!""What about you,
Miss Carrington?"Davila did not answer--contenting herself with a look, which was far
more expressive than words."Well, we will take pleasure in honoring your first request, Miss
Cavendish."He caught up a piece of rope, passed it around her arms, outside the
shawl, tied it in a running knot, and quietly lifted her from his lap
to the floor."Do you, Miss Carrington, wish to sit beside your
friend?"He took the rope and tied her, likewise.he said, and they placed her beside Elaine."If you will permit your legs to be tied, we will gladly let you have
the seat----"

"No!----"

"Well, I didn't think you would--so you will have to remain on the
floor; you see, you might be tempted to jump, if we gave you the
seat."They were running so rapidly, through the night air, that the country
could scarcely be distinguished, as it rushed by them.To Elaine, it
was an unknown land.Davila, however, was looking for something she
could recognize--some building that she knew, some stream, some
topographical formation.But in the faint and uncertain moonlight,
coupled with the speed at which they travelled, she was baffled.he said, and taking two handkerchiefs from his
pocket, he bound the eyes of both."It is only for a short while," he explained--"matter of an hour or
so, and you suffer no particular inconvenience, I trust."Neither Elaine nor Davila condescended to reply.After a moment's pause, the man went on:

"I neglected to say--and I apologize for my remissness--that you need
fear no ill-treatment.You will be shown every consideration--barring
freedom, of course--and all your wants, within the facilities at our
command, will be gratified.Naturally, however, you will not be
permitted to communicate with your friends.""But I should be better pleased if you
would tell us the reason for this abduction.""That, I regret, I am not at liberty to discuss.""And if it is not acceded to?""In that event--it would be necessary to decide what should be done
with you.""Nothing!--the time hasn't come to imply--I hope it will not come.""Do you mean that your failure would imperil our lives?""Is it possible you mean to threaten our lives?""But you will threaten,
if----"

"Exactly!if--you are at liberty to guess the rest.""Do you appreciate that the
whole Eastern Shore will be searching for us by morning--and that, if
the least indignity is offered us, your lives won't be worth a penny?""We take the risk, Miss Carrington," replied the man, placidly.Davila shrugged her shoulders, and they rode in silence, for half an
hour.Then the speed of the car slackened, they ran slowly for half a mile,
and stopped.The chief reached down, untied the handkerchiefs, and
sprang out."You may descend," he said, offering his hand.Elaine saw the hand, and ignored it; Davila refused even to see the
hand.They could make out, in the dim light, that they were before a long,
low, frame building, with the waters of the Bay just beyond.A light
burned within, and, as they entered, the odor of cooking greeted them."I
suppose it's scarcely proper in an abducted maiden, but I'm positively
famished.""I'm too enraged to eat," said Davila."Afraid?--not in the least!""No more am I--but oughtn't we be afraid?"They had been halted on the porch, while the chief went in, presumably,
to see that all was ready for their reception."If you will come in," he said, "I will show you to your apartment.""Prison, you mean," said Davila."Apartment is a little better word, don't you think?""However, as you wish, Miss Carrington, as you wish!We shall try to
make you comfortable, whatever you may call your temporary
quarters.--These two rooms are yours," he continued, throwing open the
door."They are small, but quiet and retired; you will not, I am sure,
be disturbed.Pardon me, if I remove these ropes, you will be less
hampered in your movements.supper will be served in fifteen
minutes--you will be ready?""Yes, we shall be ready," said Elaine, and the man bowed and retired."They might be worse," Davila retorted."Yes!--and we best be thankful for it.""The rooms aren't so bad," said Elaine, looking around."We each have a bed, and a bureau, and a wash-stand, and a couple of
chairs, a few chromos, a rug on the floor--and bars at the window.""I noticed the bars," said Davila."They've provided us with water, so we may as well use it," she said."I think my face needs--Heavens!"Haven't you observed the same sight in me?""I've lost
all my puffs, I know--and so have you--and your hat is a trifle awry.""Since we're not trying to make an impression, I reckon it doesn't
matter!""We will have ample opportunity to put them to
rights before Colin and Geoffrey see us."She took off her hat, pressed her hair into shape, replaced a few pins,
dashed water on her face, and washed her hands."Now," she said, going into the other room where Miss Carrington was
doing likewise, "if I only had a powder-rag, I'd feel dressed."Davila turned, and, taking a little book, from the pocket of her coat,
extended it."Here is some Papier Poudre," she said.Elaine exclaimed, and, tearing out a sheet, she
rubbed it over her face.A door opened and a young girl appeared, wearing apron and cap.said Elaine as she saw the table, with its candles and
silver (plated, to be sure), dainty china, and pressed glass."If the food is in keeping, I think we can get along for a few days.We
may as well enjoy it while it lasts.""You always were of a philosophic mind."She might have added, that it was the only way she knew--her wealth
having made all roads easy to her.The meal finished, they went back to their apartment, to find the bed
turned down for the night, and certain lingerie, which they were
without, laid out for them."You might think this was a
hotel.""We haven't tried, yet--wait until morning."A pack of cards was on the
table.Come, I'll play you Camden for a
cent a point.""I can't understand what their move is?""What
can they hope to accomplish by abducting us--or me, at any rate.It
seems they don't want anything from us.""I make it, that they hope to extort something, from a third party,
through us--by holding us prisoners.""Captain Carrington has no money--it can't be he," said Davila, "and
yet, why else should they seize me?""The question is, whose hand are they trying to force?""They will hold us until something is acceded to, the man said.Until _what_ is acceded to, and _by whom_?""You think that we are simply the pawns?""And if it isn't acceded to, they will kill us?""We won't contemplate it, just yet.They may gain their point, or we may
be rescued; in either case, we'll be saved from dying!""And, at the worst, I may be able to buy them off--to pay our own
ransom.If it's money they want, we shall not die, I assure you.""If I have to choose between death and paying, I reckon I'll pay.""Yes, I think I can pay," she said quietly."I'm not used to boasting
my wealth, but I can draw my check for a million, and it will be
honored without a moment's question.Does that make you feel easier, my
dear?""Considerably easier," said Davila, with a glad laugh."I couldn't draw
my check for much more than ten thousand cents.I am only----" She
stopped, staring."What on earth is the matter, Davila?""I have it!--it's the thieves!""I reckon I must be in a trance,
also.""Then maybe I shouldn't--but I will.Parmenter's chest is a fortune in
jewels."Croyden has searched for and not
found--and the thieves think----"

"You would better tell me the story," said Elaine, pushing back the
cards.And Davila told her....

"It is too absurd!"laughed Elaine, "those rogues trying to force
Geoffrey to divide what he hasn't got, and can't find, and we abducted
to constrain him.He couldn't comply if he wanted to, poor fellow!""But they will never believe it," said Davila.Well, if we're not rescued shortly, I can
advance the price and buy our freedom.I
reckon two hundred thousand will be sufficient--and, maybe, we can
compromise for one hundred thousand.it's not so bad, Davila, it's
not so bad!"Unless she were wofully mistaken, this abduction
would release her from the embarrassment of declaring herself to
Geoffrey."I was thinking of Colin and Geoffrey--and how they are pretty sure to
know their minds when this affair is ended."I mean, if this doesn't bring Colin to his senses, he is
hopeless."All his theoretical notions of relative wealth
will be forgotten.I've only to wait for rescue or release.On the
whole, Davila, I'm quite satisfied with being abducted.Moreover, it is
an experience which doesn't come to every girl.""What are you going to do about Colin?I rather
think you should have an answer ready; the circumstances are apt to
make him rather precipitate."The next morning after breakfast, which was served in their rooms,
Elaine was looking out through the bars on her window, trying to get
some notion of the country, when she saw, what she took to be, the
chief abductor approaching.He was a tall, well-dressed man of middle
age, with the outward appearance of a gentleman.She looked at him a
moment, then rang for the maid."I should like to have a word with the man who just came in," she
said.He appeared almost immediately, an inquiring look on his face."How can I serve you, Miss Cavendish?""By permitting us to go out for some air--these rooms were not
designed, apparently, for permanent residence.""You will have no objection to being attended, to
make sure you don't stray off too far, you know?""None whatever, if the attendant remains at a reasonable distance."Elaine asked, when they were some distance
from the house."It is south of Hampton, I think, but I can't
give any reason for my impression.The car was running very rapidly; we
were, I reckon, almost two hours on the way, but we can't be more than
fifty miles away.""If they came direct--but if they circled, we could be much less,"
Elaine observed."It's a pity we didn't think to drop something from the car to inform
our friends which way to look for us.""I tossed out a handkerchief and a glove a short
distance from Hampton--just as I struck that fellow.The difficulty is,
there isn't any assurance we kept to that road.Like as not, we started
north and ended east or south of town.What is this house, a fishing
club?"There is a small wharf, and a board-walk down to
the Bay, and the house itself is one story and spread-out, so to
speak.""Likely it's a summer club-house, which these men have either rented or
preempted for our prison.""Hence, a proper choice for our temporary residence.""I can't understand the care they are taking of us--the deference with
which we are treated, the food that is given us.""Parmenter's treasure, and the prize they think they're playing for,
has much to do with it.We are of considerable value, according to
their idea."After a while, they went back to the house.The two men, who had
remained out of hearing, but near enough to prevent any attempt to
escape, having seen them safely within, disappeared.As they passed
through the hall they encountered the chief."You are incurring considerable expense for nothing.""It is a very great pleasure, I assure you.""You are asking the impossible," she went on.Croyden told you
the simple truth.He _didn't_ find the Parmenter jewels."The man's face showed his surprise, but he only shrugged his shoulders
expressively, and made no reply."I know you do not believe it--yet it's a fact, nevertheless.Croyden couldn't pay your demands, if he wished.Of course, we enjoy
the experience, but, as I said, it's a trifle expensive for you."he said--"a jolly good sport!Macloud, so, you'll pardon me if I decline to
discuss the subject."XIX

ROBERT PARMENTER'S SUCCESSORS


In half-an-hour from the time Captain Carrington strode to the
telephone to arouse his friends, all Hampton had the startling news:
Davila Carrington and her guest, Miss Cavendish, had disappeared.How, when, and where, it could not learn, so it supplied the deficiency
as best pleased the individual--by morning, the wildest tales were
rehearsed and credited.Miss Carrington and Miss Cavendish
were not in the town, nor anywhere within a circuit of five miles.Croyden, Macloud, all the men in the place had searched the night
through, and without avail.Every horse, and every boat had been
accounted for.It remained, that they either had fallen into the Bay,
or had gone in a strange conveyance.Croyden and Macloud had returned to Clarendon for a bite of
breakfast--very late breakfast, at eleven o'clock.They had met by
accident, on their way to the house, having come from totally different
directions of search."Parmenter:--Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways.I told you it was he I saw, yesterday, driving the
automobile.""I don't quite understand why they selected Elaine and Miss Carrington
to abduct," Macloud objected, after a moment's consideration."Because they thought we would come to time more quickly, if they took
the women.They seem to be informed on everything, so, we can assume,
they are acquainted with your fondness for Miss Carrington and mine for
Elaine.Or, it's possible they thought that we both were interested in
Davila--for I've been with her a lot this autumn--and then, at the
pinch, were obliged to take Elaine, also, because she was with her and
would give the alarm if left behind.""A pretty fair scheme," said Macloud."The fellow who is managing this
business knew we would do more for the women than for ourselves.""It's the same old difficulty--we haven't got Parmenter's treasure, but
they refuse to be convinced."The telephone rang, and Croyden himself answered it."Captain Carrington asks that we come over at once," he said, hanging
up the receiver.Half way to the gate, they
met the postman coming up the walk.He handed Croyden a letter, faced
about and trudged away.Croyden glanced at it, mechanically tore open the envelope, and drew it
out.As his eyes fell on the first line, he stopped, abruptly."On Board The Parmenter,
                                      "Pirate Sloop of War,
                             "Off the Capes of the Chesapeake."Dear Sir:--

  "It seems something is required to persuade you that we mean
  business.Therefore, we have abducted Miss Carrington and her
  friend, Miss Cavendish, in the hope that it will rouse you to a
  proper realization of the eternal fitness of things, and of our
  intention that there shall be a division of the jewels--or their
  value in money.Our attorney had the pleasure of an interview
  with you, recently, at which time he specified a sum of two
  hundred and fifty thousand dollars, as being sufficient.A
  further investigation of the probable value of the jewels, having
  convinced us that we were in slight error as to their present
  worth, induces us to reduce the amount, which we claim as our
  share, to two hundred thousand dollars.This is the minimum of
  our demand, however, and we have taken the ladies, aforesaid, as
  security for its prompt payment."They will be held in all comfort and respect (if no effort at
  rescue be attempted--otherwise we will deal with them as we see
  fit), for the period of ten days from the receipt of this letter,
  which will be at noon to-morrow.If the sum indicated is not
  paid, they will, at the expiration of the ten days, be turned
  over to the tender mercies of the crew.--Understand?"As to the manner of payment--You, yourself, must go to
  Annapolis, and, between eleven and twelve in the morning, proceed
  to the extreme edge of Greenberry Point and remain standing, in
  full view from the Bay, for the space of fifteen minutes.You
  will, then, face about, step ten paces, and bury the money, which
  must be in thousand dollar bills, under a foot of sand.You will
  then, immediately, return to Annapolis and take the first car to
  Baltimore, and, thence, to Hampton."In the event that you have not reduced the jewels to cash, we
  will be content with such a division as will insure us a moiety
  thereof.It will be useless to try deception concerning
  them,--though a few thousand dollars, one way or the other, won't
  matter.When you have complied with these terms, the young women
  will be released and permitted to return to Hampton.If not--they
  will wish they were dead, even before they are.We are, sir, with
  deep respect,

                       "Y'r h'mbl.serv'ts,

                               "Robert Parmenter's Successors."Geoffrey Croyden, Esq'r.It was postmarked Hampton, 6.30 A.M.,
of that day."Which implies that it was mailed some time during the night," said
he."Do you mean, will they carry out their threat?""They have been rather persistent," Macloud replied.Damn
Parmenter and his infernal letter!""Parmenter is not to blame," said Macloud."And damn my carelessness in letting them pick my pocket!"Well, the thing, now, is to save the women--and how?""The two hundred thousand I got
for the Virginia Development bonds will be just enough.""I'm in for half, old man.Aside from any personal
feelings we may have for the women in question," he said, with a
serious sort of smile, "we owe it to them--they were abducted solely
because of us--to force us to disgorge.""I'm ready to pay the cash at once.""We have ten days, and the police
can take a try at it.""They're
all bunglers--they will be sure to make a mess of it, and, then, no man
can foresee what will happen.It's not right to subject the women to
the risk.Let us pay first, and punish after--if we can catch the
scoundrels.How long do you think Henry Cavendish will hesitate when he
learns that Elaine has been abducted, and the peril which menaces
her?""Just what he shouldn't be," Croyden returned."What is the good in
alarming him?Free her--then she may tell him, or not, as it pleases
her.""Our first duty _is_ to save the women, the rest can
bide until they are free."Much obliged, old man," said Croyden, "but a wire will do it--they're
all listed on New York.""Will you lose much, if you sell now?"He wished Croyden
would let him pay the entire amount."Just about even; a little to the good, in fact," was the answer.And Macloud said no more--he knew it was useless.At Ashburton, they found Captain Carrington pacing the long hall, in
deep distress--uncertain what course to pursue, because there was no
indication as to what had caused the disappearance.He turned, as the
two men entered."The detectives are quizzing the servants in the library," he said."I
couldn't sit still.--You have news?"he exclaimed, reading Croyden's
face.said Croyden, and gave him the letter.As he read, concern, perplexity, amazement, anger, all
showed in his countenance."They have been abducted!--Davila and Miss Cavendish, and are held for
ransom!--a fabulous ransom, which you are asked to pay," he said,
incredulously."So much, at least, is intelligible.Who
are Robert Parmenter's Successors?--and who was he?and the jewels?--I
cannot understand----"

"I'm not surprised," said Croyden."It's a long story--too long to
tell--save that Parmenter was a pirate, back in 1720, who buried a
treasure on Greenberry Point, across the Severn from Annapolis, you
know, and died, making Marmaduke Duval his heir, under certain
conditions.Marmaduke, in turn, passed it on to his son, and so on,
until Colonel Duval bequeathed it to me.Macloud and
I--for three weeks, but did not find it.Our secret was chanced upon by
two rogues, who, with their confederates, however, are under the
conviction we _did_ find it.I laughed at
them--and this abduction is the result.""Because they think I can be coerced more easily.They are under the
impression that I am--fond of Miss Carrington.At any rate, they know
I'm enough of a friend to pay, rather than subject her to the hazard."My whole fortune isn't over twenty thousand dollars.It I will gladly sacrifice, but more is impossible.""You're not to pay, my old friend," said Croyden.Macloud and I
are the ones aimed at and we will pay.""There is no reason
for you----"

"Tut!said Croyden, "you forget that we are wholly responsible;
but for us, Miss Carrington and Miss Cavendish would not have been
abducted.The obligation is ours, and we will discharge it.It is our
plain, our very plain, duty."The old man threw up his hands in the extremity of despair.We'll have Miss Carrington back in
three days.""And safe--if the letter is trustworthy, and I think it is.The police
can't do as well--they may fail entirely--and think of the possible
consequences!Miss Carrington and Miss Cavendish are very handsome
women."If they were
men, or children, it would be different--they could take some chances.--He sank on a chair and covered his face with his hands."You must let me pay what I am able," he insisted."All that I
have----"

Croyden let his hand fall sympathizingly on the other's shoulder."It shall be as you wish," he said quietly."We will pay, and you can
settle with us afterward--our stocks can be converted instantly, you
see, while yours will likely require some time.""I've been sort of unmanned--I'm better now.Shall you show the detectives the letter--tell them we are going to pay
the amount demanded?""I don't know," said Croyden, uncertainly."What's your opinion,
Colin?""Let them see the letter," Macloud answered, "but on the distinct
stipulation, that they make no effort to apprehend 'Robert Parmenter's
Successors' until the women are safely returned.They may pick up
whatever clues they can obtain for after use, but they must not do
anything which will arouse suspicion, even.""Why take them into our confidence at all?""For two reasons: It's acting square with them (which, it seems to me,
is always the wise thing to do).And, if they are not let in on the
facts, they may blunder in and spoil everything.We want to save the
women at the earliest moment, without any possible handicaps due to
ignorance or inadvertence.""We will have to explain the letter, its reference to the Parmenter
jewels, and all that it contains."We didn't find the treasure, and, I reckon,
they're welcome to search, if they think there is a chance.""Well, let it be exactly as you wish--you're quite as much concerned
for success as I am," said Croyden."Possibly, more so," returned Macloud, seriously.The two detectives arose at their
entrance.The one, Rebbert, was a Pinkerton man, the other, Sanders,
was from the Bureau at City Hall.Both were small men, with clean
shaven faces, steady, searching eyes, and an especially quiet manner.Croyden," said Rebbert, "we have been questioning the servants,
but have obtained nothing of importance, except that the ladies wore
their hats and coats (at least, they have disappeared).This, with the
fact that you found Miss Cavendish's glove and handkerchief, on a road
without the limits of Hampton, leads to the conclusion that they have
been abducted.Miss Carrington, we are informed, has no great
wealth--how as to Miss Cavendish?""She has more than sufficient--in fact, she is very rich----"

"Ah!then we _have_ a motive," said the detective."There is a motive, but it is not Miss Cavendish," Croyden answered."You're correct as to the abduction, however--this will explain," and
he handed him the letter."At noon to-day," replied Croyden, passing over the envelope."Do you object to explaining certain things in this letter?""Not in the least," replied Croyden."I'll tell you the entire
story.... Is there anything I have missed?"Now, we prefer that you should take no measures to
apprehend the abductors, until after Miss Cavendish and Miss
Carrington have been released.We are going to pay the amount
demanded.""Going to pay the two hundred thousand dollars!"cried the detectives,
in one breath."Afterward, you can get as busy as you like."A knowing smile broke over the men's faces, at the same instant."It looks that way, sir," said Rebbert; while Sanders acquiesced, with
another smile.Croyden turned to Macloud and held up his hands, hopelessly.XX

THE CHECK


On the second morning after their abduction, when Elaine and Davila
arose, the sky was obscured by fog, the trees exuded moisture, and only
a small portion of the Bay was faintly visible through the mist."We must have moved out to
Northumberland, in the night."Davila smiled, a feeble sort of smile.It was not a morning to promote
light-heartedness, and particularly under such circumstances."Yes!--Only Northumberland is more so.For a misty day, this would be
remarkably fine.--With us, it's midnight at noon--all the lights
burning, in streets, and shops, and electric cars, bells jangling,
people rushing, pushing, diving through the dirty blackness, like
devils in hell.Oh, it's pleasant, when you get used to it.--Ever been
there?""No," said Davila, "I haven't.""We must have you out--say, immediately after the holidays."I'll be glad to come, if I'm alive--and we ever get out of this awful
place.""It _is_ stupid here," said Elaine."I thought there was something
novel in being abducted, but it's rather dreary business.I'm ready to
quit, are you?""I was ready to quit before we started!""We will see what can be done about it."Ask the chief to be kind enough to come here a
moment," she said, to the girl who attended them.In a few minutes, he appeared--suave, polite, courteous."You sent for me, Miss Cavendish?"Sit down, please, I've something to say to you, Mr.----"

"Jones, for short," he replied.Jones, for short--you will pardon me, I know, if I seem unduly
personal, but these quarters are not entirely to our liking.""I'm very sorry, indeed," he replied."We tried to make them
comfortable.In what are they unsatisfactory?--we will remedy it, if
possible.""We would prefer another locality--Hampton, to be specific.""You mean that you are tired of captivity?""I see your
point of view, and I'm hopeful that Mr.Croyden will see it, also, and
permit us to release you, in a few days.""It is that very point I wish to discuss a moment with you," she
interrupted.Croyden didn't find the
jewels and that, therefore, it is impossible for him to pay.""You will pardon me if I doubt your statement.--Moreover, we are not
privileged to discuss the matter with you.Croyden, as I think I have already intimated.""Then you will draw an empty covert," she replied."That remains to be seen, as I have also intimated," said Mr."But you don't want to draw an empty covert, do you--to have only your
trouble for your pains?""It would be a great disappointment, I assure you.""You have been at considerable expense to provide for our
entertainment?""Pray do not mention it!--it's a very great pleasure.""It would be a greater pleasure to receive the cash?""Since the cash is our ultimate aim, I confess it would be equally
satisfactory," he replied."Are _we_ not
to be given a chance to find the cash?""But assume that he cannot," she reiterated, "or won't--it's the same
result.""In that event, you----"

"Would be given the opportunity," she broke in."Then why not let us consider the matter in the first instance?"It can make no difference to you whence
it comes--from Mr."And it would be much more simple to accept a check and to release us
when it is paid?""Checks are not accepted in this business!""Ordinarily not, it would be too dangerous, I admit.But if it could be
arranged to your satisfaction, what then?""I don't think it can be arranged," he replied."And that amount is----" she persisted, smiling at him the while."None--not a fraction of a penny!""I want to know why you think it can't be arranged?"No bank would pay a check for that amount to
an unknown party, without the personal advice of the drawer.""Not if it were made payable to self, and properly indorsed for
identification?""You can try it--there's no harm in trying.When it's paid, they will pay you.If it's not paid, there
is no harm done--and we are still your prisoners.You stand to win
everything and lose nothing.""If it isn't paid, you still have us," said Elaine.If the check is presented, it will be paid--you may
rest easy, on that score.""But remember," she cautioned, "when it is paid, we are to be released,
instantly.If we play
square with you, you must play square with us.I risk a fortune, see
that you make good.""Your check--it should be one of the sort you always use----"

"I always carry a few blank checks in my handbag--and fortunately, I
have it with me.You were careful to wrap it in with my arms.In a moment she returned, the blank check in
her fingers, and handed it to him.It was of a delicate robin's-egg
blue, with "The Tuscarora Trust Company" printed across the face in a
darker shade, and her monogram, in gold, at the upper end."Is it sufficiently individual to raise a presumption of regularity?""Then, let us understand each other," she said."I give you my check for two hundred thousand dollars, duly executed,
payable to my order, and endorsed by me, which, when paid, you, on
behalf of your associates and yourself, engage to accept in lieu of the
amount demanded from Mr.Croyden, and to release Miss Carrington and
myself forthwith.""There is one thing more," he said."You, on your part, are to
stipulate that no attempt will be made to arrest us.""We will engage that _we_ will do nothing to apprehend you.""Yes!--more than that is not in our power.You will have to assume the
general risk you took when you abducted us.""We will take it," was the quiet answer."I think not--at least, everything is entirely satisfactory to us.""Despite the fact that it couldn't be made so!""I didn't know we had to deal with a woman of such business sense
and--wealth," he answered gallantly."If you will get me ink and pen, I will sign the check,"
she said.She filled it in for the amount specified, signed and endorsed it.Then
she took, from her handbag, a correspondence card, embossed with her
initials, and wrote this note:

                                              "Hampton, Md.Thompson:--

  "I have made a purchase, down here, and my check for Two Hundred
  Thousand dollars, in consideration, will come through, at once."Yours very sincerely,

                                            "Elaine Cavendish."To James Thompson, Esq'r., "Treasurer, The Tuscarora Trust Co.,
  "Northumberland."She addressed the envelope and passed it and the card across to Mr."If you will mail this, to-night, it will provide against any chance of
non-payment," she said."You are a marvel of accuracy," he answered, with a bow."I would I
could always do business with you."monsieur, I pray thee, no
more!"There was a knock on the door; the maid entered and spoke in a low tone
to Jones."I am sorry to inconvenience you again," he said, turning to them, "but
I must trouble you to go aboard the tug.""On the water--that is usually the place for well behaved tugs!""Now--before I go to deposit the check!""You will be safer
on the tug.There will be no danger of an escape or a rescue--and it
won't be for long, I trust.""Your trust is no greater than ours, I assure you," said Elaine.Their few things were quickly gathered, and they went down to the
wharf, where a small boat was drawn up ready to take them to the tug,
which was lying a short distance out in the Bay."One of the Baltimore tugs, likely," said Davila."There are scores of
them, there, and some are none too chary about the sort of business
they are employed in."Jones conducted them to the little
cabin, which they were to occupy together--an upper and a lower bunk
having been provided."The maid will sleep in the galley," said he."She will look after the
cooking, and you will dine in the small cabin next to this one.It's a
bit contracted quarters for you, and I'm sorry, but it won't be for
long--as we both trust, Miss Cavendish."I will have my bank send it direct for
collection, with instructions to wire immediately if paid.I presume
you don't wish it to go through the ordinary course.""The check, and your note, should reach
the Trust Company in the same mail to-morrow morning; they can be
depended upon to wire promptly, I presume?""Then, we may be able to release you to-morrow night, certainly by
Saturday.""It can't come too soon for us.""You don't seem to like our hospitality," Jones observed."It's excellent of its sort, but we don't fancy the sort--you
understand, monsieur.And then, too, it is frightfully expensive.""We have done the best we could under the circumstances," he smiled."Until Saturday at the latest--meanwhile, permit me to offer you a very
hopeful farewell.""Why do you treat him so amiably?""I couldn't, if I
would."It wouldn't help our case
to be sullen--and it might make it much worse.I would gladly shoot
him, and hurrah over it, too, as I fancy you would do, but it does no
good to show it, now--when we _can't_ shoot him.""But I'm glad I don't have to play the
part.""Elaine, I don't know how to thank you
for my freedom----"

"Wait until you have it!""Though there isn't a
doubt of the check being paid.""My grandfather, I know, will repay you with his entire fortune, but
that will be little----"

Elaine stopped her further words by placing a hand over her mouth, and
kissing her."Take it that the reward is for
my release, and that you were just tossed in for good measure--or, that
it is a slight return for the pleasure of visiting you--or, that the
money is a small circumstance to me--or, that it is a trifling sum to
pay to be saved the embarrassment of proposing to Geoffrey,
myself--or, take it any way you like, only, don't bother your pretty
head an instant more about it.In the slang of the day: 'Forget it,'
completely and utterly, as a favor to me if for no other reason.""I'll promise to forget it--until we're free," agreed Davila."And, in the meantime, let us have a look around this old boat," said
Elaine."You're nearer the door, will you open it?Davila tried the door--it refused to open.we will content ourselves with watching the Bay through the
port hole, and when one wants to turn around the other can crawl up in
her bunk.I'm going to write a book about this experience, some
time.--I wonder what Geoffrey and Colin are doing?"she
laughed--"running around like mad and stirring up the country, I
reckon."XXI

THE JEWELS


Macloud went to New York on the evening train.He carried Croyden's
power of attorney with stock sufficient, when sold, to make up his
share of the cash.He had provided for his own share by a wire to his
brokers and his bank in Northumberland.He would reduce both amounts to one thousand dollar bills and hurry
back to Annapolis to meet Croyden.But they counted not on the railroads,--or rather they did count on
them, and they were disappointed.A freight was derailed just south of
Hampton, tearing up the track for a hundred yards, and piling the right
of way with wreckage of every description.Macloud's train was twelve
hours late leaving Hampton.Then, to add additional ill luck, they ran
into a wash out some fifty miles further on; with the result that they
did not reach New York until after the markets were over and the banks
had closed for the day.The following day, he sold the stocks,
the brokers gave him the proceeds in the desired bills, after the
delivery hour, and he made a quick get-away for Annapolis, arriving
there at nine o'clock in the evening.Croyden was awaiting him, at Carvel Hall."I'm sorry, for the girls' sake," said he, "but it's only a day lost.And, then, pray God, they be freed
before another night!That lawyer thief is a rogue and a robber, but
something tells me he will play straight.""I reckon we will have to trust him," returned Macloud.He will be over on the Point in the morning, disguised
as a <DW64> and chopping wood, on the edge of the timber.There isn't
much chance of him identifying the gang, but it's the best we can do.It's the girls first, the scoundrels afterward, if possible."At eleven o'clock the following day, Croyden, mounted on one of
"Cheney's Best," rode away from the hotel.There had been a sudden
change in the weather, during the night; the morning was clear and
bright and warm, as happens, sometimes, in Annapolis, in late November.The Severn, blue and placid, flung up an occasional white cap to greet
him, as he crossed the bridge.He nodded to the draw-keeper, who
recognized him, drew aside for an automobile to pass, and then trotted
sedately up the hill, and into the woods beyond.He could hear the Band of the Academy pounding out a quick-step, and
catch a glimpse of the long line of midshipmen passing in review,
before some notable.The "custard and cream" of the chapel dome
obtruded itself in all its hideousness; the long reach of Bancroft Hall
glowed white in the sun; the library with its clock--the former, by
some peculiar idea, placed at the farthest point from the dormitory,
and the latter where the midshipmen cannot see it--dominated the
opposite end of the grounds.Everywhere was quiet, peace, and
discipline--the embodiment of order and law,--the Flag flying over
all.And yet, he was on his way to pay a ransom of very considerable amount,
for two women who were held prisoners!He tied his horse to a limb of a maple, and walked out on the Point.Save for a few trees, uprooted by the gales, it was the same Point they
had dug over a few weeks before.A <DW64>, chopping at a log, stopped
his work, a moment, to look at him curiously, then resumed his labor.thought Croyden, but he made no effort to speak to
him.Somewhere,--from a window in the town, or from one of the numerous
ships bobbing about on the Bay or the River--he did not doubt a glass
was trained on him, and his every motion was being watched.For full twenty minutes, he stood on the extreme tip of the Point, and
looked out to sea.Then he faced directly around and stepped ten paces
inland.Kneeling, he quickly dug with a small trowel a hole a foot deep
in the sand, put into it the package of bills, wrapped in oil-skin,
and replaced the ground."Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways.May
we have seen the last of you--and may the devil take you all!"He went slowly back to his horse, mounted, and rode back to town.They
had done their part--would the thieves do theirs?Adhering strictly to the instructions, Croyden and Macloud left
Annapolis on the next car, caught the boat at Baltimore, and arrived in
Hampton in the evening, in time for dinner.They stopped a few minutes
at Ashburton, to acquaint Captain Carrington with their return, and
then went on to Clarendon.Neither wanted the other to know and each
endeavored to appear at ease.He threw his cigarette into his coffee cup, and
pushed his chair back from the table."You're trying to appear nonchalant,
and you're doing it very well, too, but you can't control your fingers
and your eyes--and neither can I, I fancy, though I've tried hard
enough, God knows!These four days of strain and
uncertainty have taken it all out of us.If I had any doubt as to my
affection for Elaine, it's vanished, now.----I don't say I'm fool
enough to propose to her, yet I'm scarcely responsible, at present.If
I were to see her this minute, I'd likely do something rash.""You're coming around to it, gradually," said Macloud.I don't know about the 'gradually.'I want to pull
myself together--to get a rein on myself--to--what are you smiling at;
am I funny?""I never saw a man fight so hard against his
personal inclinations, and a rich wife.You don't deserve her!--if I
were Elaine, I'd turn you down hard, hard.""And hence, with a woman's unreasonableness and trust in the one she
loves, she will likely accept you."Macloud blew a couple of smoke rings and watched them sail upward."I suppose you're equally discerning as to Miss Carrington, and her
love for you," Croyden commented."I regret to say, I'm not," said Macloud, seriously."That is what
troubles me, indeed.Unlike my friend, Geoffrey Croyden, I'm perfectly
sure of my own mind, but I'm not sure of the lady's.""Then, why don't you find out?""Exactly what I shall do, when she returns."We each seem to be able to answer the other's uncertainty," he
remarked, calmly."I'm going over to Ashburton, and talk with the Captain a little--sort
of cheer him up."It's a very good occupation for you, sitting up to
the old gent.I'll give you a chance by staying away, to-night.Make a
hit with grandpa, Colin, make a hit with grandpa!""And you make a hit with yourself--get rid of your foolish theory, and
come down to simple facts," Macloud retorted, and he went out."Get rid of your foolish theory," Croyden soliloquized."Well,
maybe--but _is_ it foolish, that's the question?I'm poor, once
more--I've not enough even for Elaine Cavendish's husband--there's the
rub!she won't be Geoffrey Croyden's wife, it's I who will be Elaine
Cavendish's husband.'Elaine Cavendish _and her husband_ dine with us
to-night!'--'Elaine Cavendish _and her husband_ were at the horse
show!''Elaine Cavendish _and her husband_ were here!--or there!--or
thus and so!'"It would be too belittling, too disparaging of
self-respect.--Elaine Cavendish's husband!--Elaine Cavendish's
husband!Might he out-grow it--be known for himself?He glanced up at
the portrait of the gallant soldier of a lost cause, with the high-bred
face and noble bearing."You were a brave man, Colonel Duval!"He took out a cigar, lit it very deliberately, and fell to thinking....
Presently, worn out by fatigue and anxiety, he dozed....

                  *       *       *       *       *

And as he dozed, the street door opened softly, a light step crossed
the hall, and Elaine Cavendish stood in the doorway.She was clad in black velvet, trimmed in sable.A
blue cloak was thrown, with careless grace, about her gleaming
shoulders.One slender hand lifted the gown from before her feet.She
saw the sleeping man and paused, and a smile of infinite tenderness
passed across her face.A moment she hesitated, and at the thought, a faint blush suffused her
face.Then she glided softly over, bent and kissed him on the lips.She was there, before him,
the blush still on cheek and brow.And, straightway took her, unresisting,
in his arms....

"Tell me all about yourself," he said, at last, drawing her down into
the chair and seating himself on the arm."Where is Miss
Carrington--safe?""Colin's with her--I reckon she's safe!""It won't be
his fault if she isn't, I'm sure.--I left them at Ashburton, and came
over here to--you.""I'll go back at once----"

He laughed, joyously."My hair,
dear,--do be careful!""I'll be good--if you will kiss me again!""But you're not asleep," she objected."And you will promise--not to kiss me again?"She looked up at him tantalizingly, her red lips parted, her bosom
fluttering below."If it's worth coming half way for, sweetheart--you may," she said....

"Now, if you're done with foolishness--for a little while," she said,
gayly, "I'll tell you how we managed to get free.""Oh, yes!--the Parmenter jewels.Davila told me the story, and how you
didn't find them, though our abductors think you did, and won't believe
otherwise.""None--we were most courteously treated; and they released us, as
quickly as the check was paid.""I mean, that I gave them my check for the ransom money--you hadn't the
jewels, you couldn't comply with the demand.I knew you couldn't pay it, so I did.Don't let us think of
it, dear!--It's over, and we have each other, now.Then suddenly she, woman-like, went straight back to
it."How did you think we managed to get free--escaped?""Yes--I never thought of your paying the money."she said, "you are deceiving me!--you are--_you_ paid the money,
also!"Macloud and I _did_ pay the ransom to-day--but of what consequence is
it; whether you bought your freedom, or we bought it, or both bought
it?You and Davila are here, again--that's the only thing that
matters!"came Macloud's voice from the
hallway, and Davila and he walked into the room.Elaine, with a little shriek, sprang up."Davila and I were occupying similar
positions at Ashburton, a short time ago.as
he made a motion to put his arm around her.Davila eluded him--though the traitor red confirmed his words--and
sought Elaine's side for safety."It's a pleasure only deferred, my dear!""By the way,
Elaine, how did Croyden happen to give in?He was shying off at your
wealth--said it would be giving hostages to fortune, and all that
rot.""I'm going to try to make
good.""Geoffrey," said Elaine, "won't you show us the old pirate's
letter--we're all interested in it, now.""I'll show you the letter, and where I
found it, and anything else you want to see.Croyden opened the secret drawer, and
took out the letter.he said, solemnly, and handed it to Elaine.She carried it to the table, spread it out under the lamp, and Davila
and she studied it, carefully, even as Croyden and Macloud had
done--reading the Duval endorsements over and over again."It seems to me there is something queer about these postscripts," she
said, at last; "something is needed to make them clear.Is this the
entire letter?--didn't you find anything else?""It's a bit dark in this hole.She struck it, and peered back into the recess."Here is something!--only a corner visible.""It has slipped down, back of the false partition.She drew out a tiny sheet of paper, and handed it to Croyden.Croyden glanced at it; then gave a cry of amazed surprise.The rest crowded around him while he read:

                                         "Hampton, Maryland."Memorandum to accompany the letter of Robert Parmenter, dated 10
  May 1738."Whereas, it is stipulated by the said Parmenter that the Jewels
  shall be used only in the Extremity of Need; and hence, as I have
  an abundance of this world's Goods, that Need will, likely, not
  come to me.And judging that Greenberry Point will change, in
  time--so that my son or his Descendants, if occasion arise, may
  be unable to locate the Treasure--I have lifted the Iron box,
  from the place where Parmenter buried it, and have reinterred it
  in the cellar of my House in Hampton, renewing the Injunction
  which Parmenter put upon it, that it shall be used only in the
  Extremity of Need.When this Need arise, it will be found in the
  south-east corner of the front cellar.At the depth of two feet,
  between two large stones, is the Iron box.It contains the
  jewels, the most marvelous I have ever seen.For a moment, they stood staring at one another too astonished to
speak."To think that it was here, all
the time!"They trooped down to the cellar, Croyden leading the way.Moses was off
for the evening, they had the house to themselves.As they passed the
foot of the stairs, Macloud picked up a mattock."Which is the south-east corner,
Davila?""The ground is not especially hard," observed Macloud, with the first
stroke."I reckon a yard square is sufficient.--At a depth of two feet
the memorandum says, doesn't it?"Fascinated, they were watching the fall of the pick.With every blow, they were listening for it to strike the stones."Better get a shovel, Croyden, we'll need it," said Macloud, pausing
long enough, to throw off his coat.... "Oh!I forgot to say, I wired
the Pinkerton man to recover the package you buried this morning."Croyden only nodded--stood the lamp on a box, and returned with the
coal scoop."This will answer, I reckon," he said, and fell to work.remarked Macloud, between strokes."To have hunted
the treasure, for weeks, all over Greenberry Point, and then to find it
in the cellar, like a can of lard or a bushel of potatoes.""You haven't found it, yet," Croyden cautioned."And we've gone the
depth mentioned."we haven't found it, yet!--but we're going to find it!"Macloud
answered, sinking the pick, viciously, in the ground, with the last
word.Macloud cried, sinking the pick in at another
place.The fifth stroke laid the stone
bare--the sixth and seventh loosened it, still more--the eighth and
ninth completed the task.When the earth was away and the stone exposed, he stooped and, putting
his fingers under the edges, heaved it out."The rest is for you, Croyden!"For a moment, Croyden looked at it, rather dazedly.Could it be the
jewels were _there_!--within his reach!--under that lid!Suddenly, he
laughed!--gladly, gleefully, as a boy--and sprang down into the hole.The box clung to its resting place for a second, as though it was
reluctant to be disturbed--then it yielded, and Croyden swung it onto
the bank."We'll take it to the library," he said, scraping it clean of the
adhering earth.And carrying it before them, like the Ark of the Covenant, they went
joyously up to the floor above.He placed it on the table under the chandelier, where all could see.It
was of iron, rusty with age; in dimension, about a foot square; and
fastened by a hasp, with the bar of the lock thrust through but not
secured."Light the gas, Colin!--every burner," he said."We'll have the full
effulgence, if you please."...The scintillations which leaped out to meet them, were like the rays
from myriads of gleaming, glistening, varicolored lights, of dazzling
brightness and infinite depth.A wonderful cavern of coruscating
splendor--rubies and diamonds, emeralds and sapphires, pearls and opals
glowing with all the fire of self, and the resentment of long neglect."You may touch them--they will not
fade."They put them out on the table--in little heaps of color.The women
exclaiming whene'er they touched them, cooingly as a woman does when
handling jewels--fondling them, caressing them, loving them.They stood back and gazed--fascinated by it
all:--the color--the glowing reds and whites, and greens and blues."It is wonderful--and it's true!"Two necklaces lay among the rubies, alike as lapidary's art could make
them.Croyden handed one to Macloud, the other he took."In remembrance of your release, and of Parmenter's treasure!"he said,
and clasped it around Elaine's fair neck.Macloud clasped his around Davila's."Who cares, now, for the time spent on Greenberry Point or the double
reward!"*       *       *       *       *




Transcriber's note:

Minor changes have been made to correct typesetters' errors;
otherwise, every effort has been made to remain true to the
author's words and intent.That a
gratified sense of superiority is at the root of barbarous laughter may
be at least half the truth.But there is a loving laughter in which the
only recognised superiority is that of the ideal self, the God within,
holding the mirror and the scourge for our own pettiness as well as our
neighbours'.Most of us who have had decent parents would shrink from wishing that
our father and mother had been somebody else whom we never knew; yet it
is held no impiety, rather, a graceful mark of instruction, for a man to
wail that he was not the son of another age and another nation, of which
also he knows nothing except through the easy process of an imperfect
imagination and a flattering fancy.But the period thus looked back on with a purely admiring regret, as
perfect enough to suit a superior mind, is always a long way off; the
desirable contemporaries are hardly nearer than Leonardo da Vinci, most
likely they are the fellow-citizens of Pericles, or, best of all, of the
Aeolic lyrists whose sparse remains suggest a comfortable contrast with
our redundance.No impassioned personage wishes he had been born in the
age of Pitt, that his ardent youth might have eaten the dearest bread,
dressed itself with the longest coat-tails and the shortest waist, or
heard the loudest grumbling at the heaviest war-taxes; and it would be
really something original in polished verse if one of our young writers
declared he would gladly be turned eighty-five that he might have known
the joy and pride of being an Englishman when there were fewer reforms
and plenty of highwaymen, fewer discoveries and more faces pitted with
the small-pox, when laws were made to keep up the price of corn, and the
troublesome Irish were more miserable.Three-quarters of a century ago
is not a distance that lends much enchantment to the view.We are
familiar with the average men of that period, and are still consciously
encumbered with its bad contrivances and mistaken acts.The lords and
gentlemen painted by young Lawrence talked and wrote their nonsense in a
tongue we thoroughly understand; hence their times are not much
flattered, not much glorified by the yearnings of that modern sect of
Flagellants who make a ritual of lashing--not themselves but--all their
neighbours.To me, however, that paternal time, the time of my father's
youth, never seemed prosaic, for it came to my imagination first through
his memories, which made a wondrous perspective to my little daily world
of discovery.And for my part I can call no age absolutely unpoetic: how
should it be so, since there are always children to whom the acorns and
the swallow's eggs are a wonder, always those human passions and
fatalities through which Garrick as Hamlet in bob-wig and knee-breeches
moved his audience more than some have since done in velvet tunic and
plume?But every age since the golden may be made more or less prosaic
by minds that attend only to its vulgar and sordid elements, of which
there was always an abundance even in Greece and Italy, the favourite
realms of the retrospective optimists.To be quite fair towards the
ages, a little ugliness as well as beauty must be allowed to each of
them, a little implicit poetry even to those which echoed loudest with
servile, pompous, and trivial prose.Such impartiality is not in vogue at present.If we acknowledge our
obligation to the ancients, it is hardly to be done without some
flouting of our contemporaries, who with all their faults must be
allowed the merit of keeping the world habitable for the refined
eulogists of the blameless past.One wonders whether the remarkable
originators who first had the notion of digging wells, or of churning
for butter, and who were certainly very useful to their own time as well
as ours, were left quite free from invidious comparison with
predecessors who let the water and the milk alone, or whether some
rhetorical nomad, as he stretched himself on the grass with a good
appetite for contemporary butter, became loud on the virtue of ancestors
who were uncorrupted by the produce of the cow; nay, whether in a high
flight of imaginative self-sacrifice (after swallowing the butter) he
even wished himself earlier born and already eaten for the sustenance of
a generation more _naive_ than his own.I have often had the fool's hectic of wishing about the unalterable, but
with me that useless exercise has turned chiefly on the conception of a
different self, and not, as it usually does in literature, on the
advantage of having been born in a different age, and more especially in
one where life is imagined to have been altogether majestic and
graceful.With my present abilities, external proportions, and generally
small provision for ecstatic enjoyment, where is the ground for
confidence that I should have had a preferable career in such an epoch
of society?An age in which every department has its awkward-squad seems
in my mind's eye to suit me better.I might have wandered by the Strymon
under Philip and Alexander without throwing any new light on method or
organising the sum of human knowledge; on the other hand, I might have
objected to Aristotle as too much of a systematiser, and have preferred
the freedom of a little self-contradiction as offering more chances of
truth.I gather, too, from the undeniable testimony of his disciple
Theophrastus that there were bores, ill-bred persons, and detractors
even in Athens, of species remarkably corresponding to the English, and
not yet made endurable by being classic; and altogether, with my present
fastidious nostril, I feel that I am the better off for possessing
Athenian life solely as an inodorous fragment of antiquity.As to
Sappho's Mitylene, while I am convinced that the Lesbian capital held
some plain men of middle stature and slow conversational powers, the
addition of myself to their number, though clad in the majestic folds of
the himation and without cravat, would hardly have made a sensation
among the accomplished fair ones who were so precise in adjusting their
own drapery about their delicate ankles.Whereas by being another sort
of person in the present age I might have given it some needful
theoretic clue; or I might have poured forth poetic strains which would
have anticipated theory and seemed a voice from "the prophetic soul of
the wide world dreaming of things to come;" or I might have been one of
those benignant lovely souls who, without astonishing the public and
posterity, make a happy difference in the lives close around them, and
in this way lift the average of earthly joy: in some form or other I
might have been so filled from the store of universal existence that I
should have been freed from that empty wishing which is like a child's
cry to be inside a golden cloud, its imagination being too ignorant to
figure the lining of dimness and damp.On the whole, though there is some rash boasting about enlightenment,
and an occasional insistance on an originality which is that of the
present year's corn-crop, we seem too much disposed to indulge, and to
call by complimentary names, a greater charity for other portions of the
human race than for our contemporaries.All reverence and gratitude for
the worthy Dead on whose labours we have entered, all care for the
future generations whose lot we are preparing; but some affection and
fairness for those who are doing the actual work of the world, some
attempt to regard them with the same freedom from ill-temper, whether on
private or public grounds, as we may hope will be felt by those who will
call us ancient!Otherwise, the looking before and after, which is our
grand human privilege, is in danger of turning to a sort of
other-worldliness, breeding a more illogical indifference or bitterness
than was ever bred by the ascetic's contemplation of heaven.Except on
the ground of a primitive golden age and continuous degeneracy, I see no
rational footing for scorning the whole present population of the globe,
unless I scorn every previous generation from whom they have inherited
their diseases of mind and body, and by consequence scorn my own scorn,
which is equally an inheritance of mixed ideas and feelings concocted
for me in the boiling caldron of this universally contemptible life, and
so on--scorning to infinity.This may represent some actual states of
mind, for it is a narrow prejudice of mathematicians to suppose that
ways of thinking are to be driven out of the field by being reduced to
an absurdity.The Absurd is taken as an excellent juicy thistle by many
constitutions.Reflections of this sort have gradually determined me not to grumble at
the age in which I happen to have been born--a natural tendency
certainly older than Hesiod.Many ancient beautiful things are lost,
many ugly modern things have arisen; but invert the proposition and it
is equally true.I at least am a modern with some interest in advocating
tolerance, and notwithstanding an inborn beguilement which carries my
affection and regret continually into an imagined past, I am aware that
I must lose all sense of moral proportion unless I keep alive a stronger
attachment to what is near, and a power of admiring what I best know and
understand.Hence this question of wishing to be rid of one's
contemporaries associates itself with my filial feeling, and calls up
the thought that I might as justifiably wish that I had had other
parents than those whose loving tones are my earliest memory, and whose
last parting first taught me the meaning of death.I feel bound to quell
such a wish as blasphemy.Besides, there are other reasons why I am contented that my father was a
country parson, born much about the same time as Scott and Wordsworth;
notwithstanding certain qualms I have felt at the fact that the property
on which I am living was saved out of tithe before the period of
commutation, and without the provisional transfiguration into a modus.It has sometimes occurred to me when I have been taking a slice of
excellent ham that, from a too tenable point of view, I was breakfasting
on a small squealing black pig which, more than half a century ago, was
the unwilling representative of spiritual advantages not otherwise
acknowledged by the grudging farmer or dairyman who parted with him.One
enters on a fearful labyrinth in tracing compound interest backward, and
such complications of thought have reduced the flavour of the ham; but
since I have nevertheless eaten it, the chief effect has been to
moderate the severity of my radicalism (which was not part of my
paternal inheritance) and to raise the assuaging reflection, that if the
pig and the parishioner had been intelligent enough to anticipate my
historical point of view, they would have seen themselves and the rector
in a light that would have made tithe voluntary.Notwithstanding such
drawbacks I am rather fond of the mental furniture I got by having a
father who was well acquainted with all ranks of his neighbours, and am
thankful that he was not one of those aristocratic clergymen who could
not have sat down to a meal with any family in the parish except my
lord's--still more that he was not an earl or a marquis.A chief
misfortune of high birth is that it usually shuts a man out from the
large sympathetic knowledge of human experience which comes from contact
with various classes on their own level, and in my father's time that
entail of social ignorance had not been disturbed as we see it now.To
look always from overhead at the crowd of one's fellow-men must be in
many ways incapacitating, even with the best will and intelligence.The
serious blunders it must lead to in the effort to manage them for their
good, one may see clearly by the mistaken ways people take of flattering
and enticing those whose associations are unlike their own.Hence I have
always thought that the most fortunate Britons are those whose
experience has given them a practical share in many aspects of the
national lot, who have lived long among the mixed commonalty, roughing
it with them under difficulties, knowing how their food tastes to them,
and getting acquainted with their notions and motives not by inference
from traditional types in literature or from philosophical theories, but
from daily fellowship and observation.Of course such experience is apt
to get antiquated, and my father might find himself much at a loss
amongst a mixed rural population of the present day; but he knew very
well what could be wisely expected from the miners, the weavers, the
field-labourers, and farmers of his own time--yes, and from the
aristocracy, for he had been brought up in close contact with them and
had been companion to a young nobleman who was deaf and dumb."A
clergyman, lad," he used to say to me, "should feel in himself a bit of
every class;" and this theory had a felicitous agreement with his
inclination and practice, which certainly answered in making him beloved
by his parishioners.They grumbled at their obligations towards him; but
what then?It was natural to grumble at any demand for payment, tithe
included, but also natural for a rector to desire his tithe and look
well after the levying.A Christian pastor who did not mind about his
money was not an ideal prevalent among the rural minds of fat central
England, and might have seemed to introduce a dangerous laxity of
supposition about Christian laymen who happened to be creditors.My
father was none the less beloved because he was understood to be of a
saving disposition, and how could he save without getting his tithe?The
sight of him was not unwelcome at any door, and he was remarkable among
the clergy of his district for having no lasting feud with rich or poor
in his parish.I profited by his popularity, and for months after my
mother's death, when I was a little fellow of nine, I was taken care of
first at one homestead and then at another; a variety which I enjoyed
much more than my stay at the Hall, where there was a tutor.Afterwards
for several years I was my father's constant companion in his outdoor
business, riding by his side on my little pony and listening to the
lengthy dialogues he held with Darby or Joan, the one on the road or in
the fields, the other outside or inside her door.In my earliest
remembrance of him his hair was already grey, for I was his youngest as
well as his only surviving child; and it seemed to me that advanced age
was appropriate to a father, as indeed in all respects I considered him
a parent so much to my honour, that the mention of my relationship to
him was likely to secure me regard among those to whom I was otherwise a
stranger--my father's stories from his life including so many names of
distant persons that my imagination placed no limit to his
acquaintanceship.He was a pithy talker, and his sermons bore marks of
his own composition.It is true, they must have been already old when I
began to listen to them, and they were no more than a year's supply, so
that they recurred as regularly as the Collects.But though this system
has been much ridiculed, I am prepared to defend it as equally sound
with that of a liturgy; and even if my researches had shown me that some
of my father's yearly sermons had been copied out from the works of
elder divines, this would only have been another proof of his good
judgment.One may prefer fresh eggs though laid by a fowl of the meanest
understanding, but why fresh sermons?Nor can I be sorry, though myself given to meditative if not active
innovation, that my father was a Tory who had not exactly a dislike to
innovators and dissenters, but a slight opinion of them as persons of
ill-founded self-confidence; whence my young ears gathered many details
concerning those who might perhaps have called themselves the more
advanced thinkers in our nearest market-town, tending to convince me
that their characters were quite as mixed as those of the thinkers
behind them.This circumstance of my rearing has at least delivered me
from certain mistakes of classification which I observe in many of my
superiors, who have apparently no affectionate memories of a goodness
mingled with what they now regard as outworn prejudices.Indeed, my
philosophical notions, such as they are, continually carry me back to
the time when the fitful gleams of a spring day used to show me my own
shadow as that of a small boy on a small pony, riding by the side of a
larger cob-mounted shadow over the breezy uplands which we used to
dignify with the name of hills, or along by-roads with broad grassy
borders and hedgerows reckless of utility, on our way to outlying
hamlets, whose groups of inhabitants were as distinctive to my
imagination as if they had belonged to different regions of the globe.From these we sometimes rode onward to the adjoining parish, where also
my father officiated, for he was a pluralist, but--I hasten to add--on
the smallest scale; for his one extra living was a poor vicarage, with
hardly fifty parishioners, and its church would have made a very shabby
barn, the grey worm-eaten wood of its pews and pulpit, with their doors
only half hanging on the hinges, being exactly the colour of a lean
mouse which I once observed as an interesting member of the scant
congregation, and conjectured to be the identical church mouse I had
heard referred to as an example of extreme poverty; for I was a
precocious boy, and often reasoned after the fashion of my elders,
arguing that "Jack and Jill" were real personages in our parish, and
that if I could identify "Jack" I should find on him the marks of a
broken crown.Sometimes when I am in a crowded London drawing-room (for I am a
town-bird now, acquainted with smoky eaves, and tasting Nature in the
parks) quick flights of memory take me back among my father's
parishioners while I am still conscious of elbowing men who wear the
same evening uniform as myself; and I presently begin to wonder what
varieties of history lie hidden under this monotony of aspect.Some of
them, perhaps, belong to families with many quarterings; but how many
"quarterings" of diverse contact with their fellow-countrymen enter into
their qualifications to be parliamentary leaders, professors of social
science, or journalistic guides of the popular mind?Not that I feel
myself a person made competent by experience; on the contrary, I argue
that since an observation of different ranks has still left me
practically a poor creature, what must be the condition of those who
object even to read about the life of other British classes than their
own?But of my elbowing neighbours with their crush hats, I usually
imagine that the most distinguished among them have probably had a far
more instructive journey into manhood than mine.Here, perhaps, is a
thought-worn physiognomy, seeming at the present moment to be classed as
a mere species of white cravat and swallow-tail, which may once, like
Faraday's, have shown itself in curiously dubious embryonic form leaning
against a cottage lintel in small corduroys, and hungrily eating a bit
of brown bread and bacon; _there_ is a pair of eyes, now too much
wearied by the gas-light of public assemblies, that once perhaps learned
to read their native England through the same alphabet as mine--not
within the boundaries of an ancestral park, never even being driven
through the county town five miles off, but--among the midland villages
and markets, along by the tree-studded hedgerows, and where the heavy
barges seem in the distance to float mysteriously among the rushes and
the feathered grass.Our vision, both real and ideal, has since then
been filled with far other scenes: among eternal snows and stupendous
sun-scorched monuments of departed empires; within the scent of the long
orange-groves; and where the temple of Neptune looks out over the
siren-haunted sea.But my eyes at least have kept their early
affectionate joy in our native landscape, which is one deep root of our
national life and language.And I often smile at my consciousness that certain conservative
prepossessions have mingled themselves for me with the influences of our
midland scenery, from the tops of the elms down to the buttercups and
the little wayside vetches.That part of my father's
prime to which he oftenest referred had fallen on the days when the
great wave of political enthusiasm and belief in a speedy regeneration
of all things had ebbed, and the supposed millennial initiative of
France was turning into a Napoleonic empire, the sway of an Attila with
a mouth speaking proud things in a jargon half revolutionary, half
Roman.Men were beginning to shrink timidly from the memory of their
own words and from the recognition of the fellowships they had formed
ten years before; and even reforming Englishmen for the most part were
willing to wait for the perfection of society, if only they could keep
their throats perfect and help to drive away the chief enemy of mankind
from our coasts.To my father's mind the noisy teachers of revolutionary
doctrine were, to speak mildly, a variable mixture of the fool and the
scoundrel; the welfare of the nation lay in a strong Government which
could maintain order; and I was accustomed to hear him utter the word
"Government" in a tone that charged it with awe, and made it part of my
effective religion, in contrast with the word "rebel," which seemed to
carry the stamp of evil in its syllables, and, lit by the fact that
Satan was the first rebel, made an argument dispensing with more
detailed inquiry.I gathered that our national troubles in the first two
decades of this century were not at all due to the mistakes of our
administrators; and that England, with its fine Church and Constitution,
would have been exceedingly well off if every British subject had been
thankful for what was provided, and had minded his own business--if,
for example, numerous Catholics of that period had been aware how very
modest they ought to be considering they were Irish.The times, I heard,
had often been bad; but I was constantly hearing of "bad times" as a
name for actual evenings and mornings when the godfathers who gave them
that name appeared to me remarkably comfortable.Altogether, my father's
England seemed to me lovable, laudable, full of good men, and having
good rulers, from Mr Pitt on to the Duke of Wellington, until he was for
emancipating the Catholics; and it was so far from prosaic to me that I
looked into it for a more exciting romance than such as I could find in
my own adventures, which consisted mainly in fancied crises calling for
the resolute wielding of domestic swords and firearms against unapparent
robbers, rioters, and invaders who, it seemed, in my father's prime had
more chance of being real.The morris-dancers had not then dwindled to a
ragged and almost vanished rout (owing the traditional name probably to
the historic fancy of our superannuated groom); also, the good old king
was alive and well, which made all the more difference because I had no
notion what he was and did--only understanding in general that if he had
been still on the throne he would have hindered everything that wise
persons thought undesirable.Certainly that elder England with its frankly saleable boroughs, so
cheap compared with the seats obtained under the reformed method, and
its boroughs kindly presented by noblemen desirous to encourage
gratitude; its prisons with a miscellaneous company of felons and
maniacs and without any supply of water; its bloated, idle charities;
its non-resident, jovial clergy; its militia-balloting; and above all,
its blank ignorance of what we, its posterity, should be thinking of
it,--has great differences from the England of to-day.Is there any country which shows at once as much
stability and as much susceptibility to change as ours?Our national
life is like that scenery which I early learned to love, not subject to
great convulsions, but easily showing more or less delicate (sometimes
melancholy) effects from minor changes.Hence our midland plains have
never lost their familiar expression and conservative spirit for me;
yet at every other mile, since I first looked on them, some sign of
world-wide change, some new direction of human labour has wrought itself
into what one may call the speech of the landscape--in contrast with
those grander and vaster regions of the earth which keep an indifferent
aspect in the presence of men's toil and devices.What does it signify
that a lilliputian train passes over a viaduct amidst the abysses of the
Apennines, or that a caravan laden with a nation's offerings creeps
across the unresting sameness of the desert, or that a petty cloud of
steam sweeps for an instant over the face of an Egyptian colossus
immovably submitting to its slow burial beneath the sand?But our
woodlands and pastures, our hedge-parted corn-fields and meadows, our
bits of high common where we used to plant the windmills, our quiet
little rivers here and there fit to turn a mill-wheel, our villages
along the old coach-roads, are all easily alterable lineaments that seem
to make the face of our Motherland sympathetic with the laborious lives
of her children.She does not take their ploughs and waggons
contemptuously, but rather makes every hovel and every sheepfold, every
railed bridge or fallen tree-trunk an agreeably noticeable incident; not
a mere speck in the midst of unmeasured vastness, but a piece of our
social history in pictorial writing.Our rural tracts--where no Babel-chimney scales the heavens--are without
mighty objects to fill the soul with the sense of an outer world
unconquerably aloof from our efforts.The wastes are playgrounds (and
let us try to keep them such for the children's children who will
inherit no other sort of demesne); the grasses and reeds nod to each
other over the river, but we have cut a canal close by; the very heights
laugh with corn in August or lift the plough-team against the sky in
September.Then comes a crowd of burly navvies with pickaxes and
barrows, and while hardly a wrinkle is made in the fading mother's face
or a new curve of health in the blooming girl's, the hills are cut
through or the breaches between them spanned, we choose our level and
the white steam-pennon flies along it.But because our land shows this readiness to be changed, all signs of
permanence upon it raise a tender attachment instead of awe: some of us,
at least, love the scanty relics of our forests, and are thankful if a
bush is left of the old hedgerow.A crumbling bit of wall where the
delicate ivy-leaved toad-flax hangs its light branches, or a bit of grey
thatch with patches of dark moss on its shoulder and a troop of
grass-stems on its ridge, is a thing to visit.And then the tiled roof
of cottage and homestead, of the long cow-shed where generations of the
milky mothers have stood patiently, of the broad-shouldered barns where
the old-fashioned flail once made resonant music, while the watch-dog
barked at the timidly venturesome fowls making pecking raids on the
outflying grain--the roofs that have looked out from among the elms and
walnut-trees, or beside the yearly group of hay and corn stacks, or
below the square stone steeple, gathering their grey or ochre-tinted
lichens and their olive-green mosses under all ministries,--let us
praise the sober harmonies they give to our landscape, helping to unite
us pleasantly with the elder generations who tilled the soil for us
before we were born, and paid heavier and heavier taxes, with much
grumbling, but without that deepest root of corruption--the
self-indulgent despair which cuts down and consumes and never plants.Perhaps this England of my affections is half
visionary--a dream in which things are connected according to my
well-fed, lazy mood, and not at all by the multitudinous links of
graver, sadder fact, such as belong everywhere to the story of human
labour.Well, well, the illusions that began for us when we were less
acquainted with evil have not lost their value when we discern them to
be illusions.They feed the ideal Better, and in loving them still, we
strengthen the precious habit of loving something not visibly, tangibly
existent, but a spiritual product of our visible tangible selves.I cherish my childish loves--the memory of that warm little nest where
my affections were fledged.Since then I have learned to care for
foreign countries, for literatures foreign and ancient, for the life of
Continental towns dozing round old cathedrals, for the life of London,
half sleepless with eager thought and strife, with indigestion or with
hunger; and now my consciousness is chiefly of the busy, anxious
metropolitan sort.My system responds sensitively to the London
weather-signs, political, social, literary; and my bachelor's hearth is
imbedded where by much craning of head and neck I can catch sight of a
sycamore in the Square garden: I belong to the "Nation of London."There have been many voluntary exiles in the world, and probably in the
very first exodus of the patriarchal Aryans--for I am determined not to
fetch my examples from races whose talk is of uncles and no
fathers--some of those who sallied forth went for the sake of a loved
companionship, when they would willingly have kept sight of the familiar
plains, and of the hills to which they had first lifted up their eyes.HOW WE ENCOURAGE RESEARCH.The serene and beneficent goddess Truth, like other deities whose
disposition has been too hastily inferred from that of the men who have
invoked them, can hardly be well pleased with much of the worship paid
to her even in this milder age, when the stake and the rack have ceased
to form part of her ritual.Some cruelties still pass for service done
in her honour: no thumb-screw is used, no iron boot, no scorching of
flesh; but plenty of controversial bruising, laceration, and even
lifelong maiming.Less than formerly; but so long as this sort of
truth-worship has the sanction of a public that can often understand
nothing in a controversy except personal sarcasm or slanderous ridicule,
it is likely to continue.The sufferings of its victims are often as
little regarded as those of the sacrificial pig offered in old time,
with what we now regard as a sad miscalculation of effects.One such victim is my old acquaintance Merman.Twenty years ago Merman was a young man of promise, a conveyancer with a
practice which had certainly budded, but, like Aaron's rod, seemed not
destined to proceed further in that marvellous activity.Meanwhile he
occupied himself in miscellaneous periodical writing and in a
multifarious study of moral and physical science.What chiefly attracted
him in all subjects were the vexed questions which have the advantage of
not admitting the decisive proof or disproof that renders many ingenious
arguments superannuated.Not that Merman had a wrangling disposition: he
put all his doubts, queries, and paradoxes deferentially, contended
without unpleasant heat and only with a sonorous eagerness against the
personality of Homer, expressed himself civilly though firmly on the
origin of language, and had tact enough to drop at the right moment such
subjects as the ultimate reduction of all the so-called elementary
substances, his own total scepticism concerning Manetho's chronology, or
even the relation between the magnetic condition of the earth and the
outbreak of revolutionary tendencies.Such flexibility was naturally
much helped by his amiable feeling towards woman, whose nervous system,
he was convinced, would not bear the continuous strain of difficult
topics; and also by his willingness to contribute a song whenever the
same desultory charmer proposed music.Indeed his tastes were domestic
enough to beguile him into marriage when his resources were still very
moderate and partly uncertain.His friends wished that so ingenious and
agreeable a fellow might have more prosperity than they ventured to hope
for him, their chief regret on his account being that he did not
concentrate his talent and leave off forming opinions on at least
half-a-dozen of the subjects over which he scattered his attention,
especially now that he had married a "nice little woman" (the generic
name for acquaintances' wives when they are not markedly disagreeable).He could not, they observed, want all his various knowledge and Laputan
ideas for his periodical writing which brought him most of his bread,
and he would do well to use his talents in getting a speciality that
would fit him for a post.Perhaps these well-disposed persons were a
little rash in presuming that fitness for a post would be the surest
ground for getting it; and on the whole, in now looking back on their
wishes for Merman, their chief satisfaction must be that those wishes
did not contribute to the actual result.For in an evil hour Merman did concentrate himself.He had for many
years taken into his interest the comparative history of the ancient
civilisations, but it had not preoccupied him so as to narrow his
generous attention to everything else.One sleepless night, however (his
wife has more than once narrated to me the details of an event memorable
to her as the beginning of sorrows), after spending some hours over the
epoch-making work of Grampus, a new idea seized him with regard to the
possible connection of certain symbolic monuments common to widely
scattered races.The night was cold, and the
sudden withdrawal of warmth made his wife first dream of a snowball,
and then cry--

"What is the matter, Proteus?"That fellow Grampus, whose book is cried up as a
revelation, is all wrong about the Magicodumbras and the Zuzumotzis, and
I have got hold of the right clue.""It signifies this, Julia, that if I am right I shall set the world
right; I shall regenerate history; I shall win the mind of Europe to a
new view of social origins; I shall bruise the head of many
superstitions.""Oh no, dear, don't go too far into things.What are the Madicojumbras and Zuzitotzums?I never heard
you talk of them before.What use can it be troubling yourself about
such things?""That is the way, Julia--that is the way wives alienate their husbands,
and make any hearth pleasanter to him than his own!""What _do_ you mean, Proteus?""Why, if a woman will not try to understand her husband's ideas, or at
least to believe that they are of more value than she can understand--if
she is to join anybody who happens to be against him, and suppose he is
a fool because others contradict him--there is an end of our happiness."Oh no, Proteus, dear.I do believe what you say is right That is my
only guide.I am sure I never have any opinions in any other way: I mean
about subjects.Of course there are many little things that would tease
you, that you like me to judge of for myself.I know I said once that I
did not want you to sing 'Oh ruddier than the cherry,' because it was
not in your voice.But I cannot remember ever differing from you about
_subjects_.I never in my life thought any one cleverer than you."Julia Merman was really a "nice little woman," not one of the stately
Dians sometimes spoken of in those terms.Her black _silhouette_ had a
very infantine aspect, but she had discernment and wisdom enough to act
on the strong hint of that memorable conversation, never again giving
her husband the slightest ground for suspecting that she thought
treasonably of his ideas in relation to the Magicodumbras and
Zuzumotzis, or in the least relaxed her faith in his infallibility
because Europe was not also convinced of it.It was well for her that
she did not increase her troubles in this way; but to do her justice,
what she was chiefly anxious about was to avoid increasing her husband's
troubles.In the first development and
writing out of his scheme, Merman had a more intense kind of
intellectual pleasure than he had ever known before.His face became
more radiant, his general view of human prospects more cheerful.Foreseeing that truth as presented by himself would win the recognition
of his contemporaries, he excused with much liberality their rather
rough treatment of other theorists whose basis was less perfect.His own
periodical criticisms had never before been so amiable: he was sorry for
that unlucky majority whom the spirit of the age, or some other
prompting more definite and local, compelled to write without any
particular ideas.The possession of an original theory which has not yet
been assailed must certainly sweeten the temper of a man who is not
beforehand ill-natured.And Merman was the reverse of ill-natured.But the hour of publication came; and to half-a-dozen persons, described
as the learned world of two hemispheres, it became known that Grampus
was attacked.This might have been a small matter; for who or what on
earth that is good for anything is not assailed by ignorance, stupidity,
or malice--and sometimes even by just objection?But on examination it
appeared that the attack might possibly be held damaging, unless the
ignorance of the author were well exposed and his pretended facts shown
to be chimeras of that remarkably hideous kind begotten by imperfect
learning on the more feminine element of original incapacity.Grampus
himself did not immediately cut open the volume which Merman had been
careful to send him, not without a very lively and shifting conception
of the possible effects which the explosive gift might produce on the
too eminent scholar--effects that must certainly have set in on the
third day from the despatch of the parcel.But in point of fact Grampus
knew nothing of the book until his friend Lord Narwhal sent him an
American newspaper containing a spirited article by the well-known
Professor Sperm N. Whale which was rather equivocal in its bearing, the
passages quoted from Merman being of rather a telling sort, and the
paragraphs which seemed to blow defiance being unaccountably feeble,
coming from so distinguished a Cetacean.Then, by another post, arrived
letters from Butzkopf and Dugong, both men whose signatures were
familiar to the Teutonic world in the _Selten-erscheinende
Monat-schrift_ or Hayrick for the insertion of Split Hairs, asking their
Master whether he meant to take up the combat, because, in the contrary
case, both were ready.Thus America and Germany were roused, though England was still drowsy,
and it seemed time now for Grampus to find Merman's book under the heap
and cut it open.For his own part he was perfectly at ease about his
system; but this is a world in which the truth requires defence, and
specious falsehood must be met with exposure.Grampus having once looked
through the book, no longer wanted any urging to write the most crushing
of replies.This, and nothing less than this, was due from him to the
cause of sound inquiry; and the punishment would cost him little pains.In three weeks from that time the palpitating Merman saw his book
announced in the programme of the leading Review.No need for Grampus to
put his signature.Who else had his vast yet microscopic knowledge, who
else his power of epithet?This article in which Merman was pilloried
and as good as mutilated--for he was shown to have neither ear nor nose
for the subtleties of philological and archaeological study--was much
read and more talked of, not because of any interest in the system of
Grampus, or any precise conception of the danger attending lax views of
the Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis, but because the sharp epigrams with
which the victim was lacerated, and the soaring fountains of acrid mud
which were shot upward and poured over the fresh wounds, were found
amusing in recital.A favourite passage was one in which a certain kind
of sciolist was described as a creature of the Walrus kind, having a
phantasmal resemblance to higher animals when seen by ignorant minds in
the twilight, dabbling or hobbling in first one element and then the
other, without parts or organs suited to either, in fact one of Nature's
impostors who could not be said to have any artful pretences, since a
congenital incompetence to all precision of aim and movement made their
every action a pretence--just as a being born in doeskin gloves would
necessarily pass a judgment on surfaces, but we all know what his
judgment would be worth.In drawing-room circles, and for the immediate
hour, this ingenious comparison was as damaging as the showing up of
Merman's mistakes and the mere smattering of linguistic and historical
knowledge which he had presumed to be a sufficient basis for theorising;
but the more learned cited his blunders aside to each other and laughed
the laugh of the initiated.In fact, Merman's was a remarkable case of
sudden notoriety.In London drums and clubs he was spoken of abundantly
as one who had written ridiculously about the Magicodumbras and
Zuzumotzis: the leaders of conversation, whether Christians, Jews,
infidels, or of any other confession except the confession of ignorance,
pronouncing him shallow and indiscreet if not presumptuous and absurd.He was heard of at Warsaw, and even Paris took knowledge of him.M.
Cachalot had not read either Grampus or Merman, but he heard of their
dispute in time to insert a paragraph upon it in his brilliant work,
_L'orient au point de vue actuel_, in which he was dispassionate enough
to speak of Grampus as possessing a _coup d'oeil presque francais_ in
matters of historical interpretation, and of Merman as nevertheless an
objector _qui merite d'etre connu_.M. Porpesse, also, availing himself
of M. Cachalot's knowledge, reproduced it in an article with certain
additions, which it is only fair to distinguish as his own, implying
that the vigorous English of Grampus was not always as correct as a
Frenchman could desire, while Merman's objections were more sophistical
than solid.Presently, indeed, there appeared an able _extrait_ of
Grampus's article in the valuable _Rapporteur scientifique et
historique_, and Merman's mistakes were thus brought under the notice of
certain Frenchmen who are among the masters of those who know on
oriental subjects.In a word, Merman, though not extensively read, was
extensively read about.Perhaps nobody, except his wife, for a
moment reflected on that.An amused society considered that he was
severely punished, but did not take the trouble to imagine his
sensations; indeed this would have been a difficulty for persons less
sensitive and excitable than Merman himself.Perhaps that popular
comparison of the Walrus had truth enough to bite and blister on
thorough application, even if exultant ignorance had not applauded it.But it is well known that the walrus, though not in the least a
malignant animal, if allowed to display its remarkably plain person and
blundering performances at ease in any element it chooses, becomes
desperately savage and musters alarming auxiliaries when attacked or
hurt.In this characteristic, at least, Merman resembled the walrus.And
now he concentrated himself with a vengeance.That his counter-theory
was fundamentally the right one he had a genuine conviction, whatever
collateral mistakes he might have committed; and his bread would not
cease to be bitter to him until he had convinced his contemporaries that
Grampus had used his minute learning as a dust-cloud to hide
sophistical evasions--that, in fact, minute learning was an obstacle to
clear-sighted judgment, more especially with regard to the Magicodumbras
and Zuzumotzis, and that the best preparation in this matter was a wide
survey of history and a diversified observation of men.Still, Merman
was resolved to muster all the learning within his reach, and he
wandered day and night through many wildernesses of German print, he
tried compendious methods of learning oriental tongues, and, so to
speak, getting at the marrow of languages independently of the bones,
for the chance of finding details to corroborate his own views, or
possibly even to detect Grampus in some oversight or textual tampering.All other work was neglected: rare clients were sent away and amazed
editors found this maniac indifferent to his chance of getting
book-parcels from them.It was many months before Merman had satisfied
himself that he was strong enough to face round upon his adversary.But
at last he had prepared sixty condensed pages of eager argument which
seemed to him worthy to rank with the best models of controversial
writing.He had acknowledged his mistakes, but had restated his theory
so as to show that it was left intact in spite of them; and he had even
found cases in which Ziphius, Microps, Scrag Whale the explorer, and
other Cetaceans of unanswerable authority, were decidedly at issue with
Grampus.Especially a passage cited by this last from that greatest of
fossils Megalosaurus was demonstrated by Merman to be capable of three
different interpretations, all preferable to that chosen by Grampus, who
took the words in their most literal sense; for, 1 deg., the incomparable
Saurian, alike unequalled in close observation and far-glancing
comprehensiveness, might have meant those words ironically; 2 deg., _motzis_
was probably a false reading for _potzis_, in which case its bearing was
reversed; and 3 deg., it is known that in the age of the Saurians there
were conceptions about the _motzis_ which entirely remove it from the
category of things comprehensible in an age when Saurians run
ridiculously small: all which views were godfathered by names quite fit
to be ranked with that of Grampus.In fine, Merman wound up his
rejoinder by sincerely thanking the eminent adversary without whose
fierce assault he might not have undertaken a revision in the course of
which he had met with unexpected and striking confirmations of his own
fundamental views.Evidently Merman's anger was at white heat.The rejoinder being complete, all that remained was to find a suitable
medium for its publication.Distinguished mediums
would not lend themselves to contradictions of Grampus, or if they
would, Merman's article was too long and too abstruse, while he would
not consent to leave anything out of an article which had no
superfluities; for all this happened years ago when the world was at a
different stage.At last, however, he got his rejoinder printed, and not
on hard terms, since the medium, in every sense modest, did not ask him
to pay for its insertion.But if Merman expected to call out Grampus again, he was mistaken.Everybody felt it too absurd that Merman should undertake to correct
Grampus in matters of erudition, and an eminent man has something else
to do than to refute a petty objector twice over.What was essential had
been done: the public had been enabled to form a true judgment of
Merman's incapacity, the Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis were but
subsidiary elements in Grampus's system, and Merman might now be dealt
with by younger members of the master's school.But he had at least the
satisfaction of finding that he had raised a discussion which would not
be let die.The followers of Grampus took it up with an ardour and
industry of research worthy of their exemplar.Butzkopf made it the
subject of an elaborate _Einleitung_ to his important work, _Die
Bedeutung des Aegyptischen Labyrinthes_; and Dugong, in a remarkable
address which he delivered to a learned society in Central Europe,
introduced Merman's theory with so much power of sarcasm that it became
a theme of more or less derisive allusion to men of many tongues.Merman
with his Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis was on the way to become a
proverb, being used illustratively by many able journalists who took
those names of questionable things to be Merman's own invention, "than
which," said one of the graver guides, "we can recall few more
melancholy examples of speculative aberration."Naturally the subject
passed into popular literature, and figured very commonly in advertised
programmes.The fluent Loligo, the formidable Shark, and a younger
member of his remarkable family known as S. Catulus, made a special
reputation by their numerous articles, eloquent, lively, or abusive, all
on the same theme, under titles ingeniously varied, alliterative,
sonorous, or boldly fanciful; such as, "Moments with Mr Merman," "Mr
Merman and the Magicodumbras," "Greenland Grampus and Proteus Merman,"
"Grampian Heights and their Climbers, or the New Excelsior."They tossed
him on short sentences; they swathed him in paragraphs of winding
imagery; they found him at once a mere plagiarist and a theoriser of
unexampled perversity, ridiculously wrong about _potzis_ and ignorant of
Pali; they hinted, indeed, at certain things which to their knowledge he
had silently brooded over in his boyhood, and seemed tolerably well
assured that this preposterous attempt to gainsay an incomparable
Cetacean of world-wide fame had its origin in a peculiar mixture of
bitterness and eccentricity which, rightly estimated and seen in its
definite proportions, would furnish the best key to his argumentation.All alike were sorry for Merman's lack of sound learning, but how could
their readers be sorry?Sound learning would not have been amusing; and
as it was, Merman was made to furnish these readers with amusement at no
expense of trouble on their part.Even burlesque writers looked into his
book to see where it could be made use of, and those who did not know
him were desirous of meeting him at dinner as one likely to feed their
comic vein.On the other hand, he made a serious figure in sermons under the name of
"Some" or "Others" who had attempted presumptuously to scale eminences
too high and arduous for human ability, and had given an example of
ignominious failure edifying to the humble Christian.All this might be very advantageous for able persons whose superfluous
fund of expression needed a paying investment, but the effect on Merman
himself was unhappily not so transient as the busy writing and speaking
of which he had become the occasion.His certainty that he was right
naturally got stronger in proportion as the spirit of resistance was
stimulated.The scorn and unfairness with which he felt himself to have
been treated by those really competent to appreciate his ideas had
galled him and made a chronic sore; and the exultant chorus of the
incompetent seemed a pouring of vinegar on his wound.His brain became a
registry of the foolish and ignorant objections made against him, and of
continually amplified answers to these objections.Unable to get his
answers printed, he had recourse to that more primitive mode of
publication, oral transmission or button-holding, now generally regarded
as a troublesome survival, and the once pleasant, flexible Merman was on
the way to be shunned as a bore.His interest in new acquaintances
turned chiefly on the possibility that they would care about the
Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis; that they would listen to his complaints
and exposures of unfairness, and not only accept copies of what he had
written on the subject, but send him appreciative letters in
acknowledgment.Repeated disappointment of such hopes tended to embitter
him, and not the less because after a while the fashion of mentioning
him died out, allusions to his theory were less understood, and people
could only pretend to remember it.And all the while Merman was
perfectly sure that his very opponents who had knowledge enough to be
capable judges were aware that his book, whatever errors of statement
they might detect in it, had served as a sort of divining rod, pointing
out hidden sources of historical interpretation; nay, his jealous
examination discerned in a new work by Grampus himself a certain
shifting of ground which--so poor Merman declared--was the sign of an
intention gradually to appropriate the views of the man he had attempted
to brand as an ignorant impostor.And the housekeeping?--the rent, food, and clothing, which
controversy can hardly supply unless it be of the kind that serves as a
recommendation to certain posts.Controversial pamphlets have been known
to earn large plums; but nothing of the sort could be expected from
unpractical heresies about the Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis.Merman's reputation as a sober thinker, a safe writer, a
sound lawyer, was irretrievably injured: the distractions of controversy
had caused him to neglect useful editorial connections, and indeed his
dwindling care for miscellaneous subjects made his contributions too
dull to be desirable.Even if he could now have given a new turn to his
concentration, and applied his talents so as to be ready to show himself
an exceptionally qualified lawyer, he would only have been like an
architect in competition, too late with his superior plans; he would not
have had an opportunity of showing his qualification.The small capital which had filled up deficiencies of
income was almost exhausted, and Julia, in the effort to make supplies
equal to wants, had to use much ingenuity in diminishing the wants.The
brave and affectionate woman whose small outline, so unimpressive
against an illuminated background, held within it a good share of
feminine heroism, did her best to keep up the charm of home and soothe
her husband's excitement; parting with the best jewel among her wedding
presents in order to pay rent, without ever hinting to her husband that
this sad result had come of his undertaking to convince people who only
laughed at him.She was a resigned little creature, and reflected that
some husbands took to drinking and others to forgery: hers had only
taken to the Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis, and was not unkind--only a
little more indifferent to her and the two children than she had ever
expected he would be, his mind being eaten up with "subjects," and
constantly a little angry, not with her, but with everybody else,
especially those who were celebrated.Merman felt himself ill-used by the world, and
thought very much worse of the world in consequence.The gall of his
adversaries' ink had been sucked into his system and ran in his blood.He was still in the prime of life, but his mind was aged by that eager
monotonous construction which comes of feverish excitement on a single
topic and uses up the intellectual strength.Merman had never been a rich man, but he was now conspicuously poor, and
in need of the friends who had power or interest which he believed they
could exert on his behalf.Their omitting or declining to give this help
could not seem to him so clearly as to them an inevitable consequence of
his having become impracticable, or at least of his passing for a man
whose views were not likely to be safe and sober.Each friend in turn
offended him, though unwillingly, and was suspected of wishing to shake
him off.It was not altogether so; but poor Merman's society had
undeniably ceased to be attractive, and it was difficult to help him.At
last the pressure of want urged him to try for a post far beneath his
earlier prospects, and he gained it.He holds it still, for he has no
vices, and his domestic life has kept up a sweetening current of motive
around and within him.Nevertheless, the bitter flavour mingling itself
with all topics, the premature weariness and withering, are irrevocably
there.It is as if he had gone through a disease which alters what we
call the constitution.He has long ceased to talk eagerly of the ideas
which possess him, or to attempt making proselytes.The dial has moved
onward, and he himself sees many of his former guesses in a new light.On the other hand, he has seen what he foreboded, that the main idea
which was at the root of his too rash theorising has been adopted by
Grampus and received with general respect, no reference being heard to
the ridiculous figure this important conception made when ushered in by
the incompetent "Others."Now and then, on rare occasions, when a sympathetic _tete-a-tete_ has
restored some of his old expansiveness, he will tell a companion in a
railway carriage, or other place of meeting favourable to
autobiographical confidences, what has been the course of things in his
particular case, as an example of the justice to be expected of the
world.The companion usually allows for the bitterness of a disappointed
man, and is secretly disinclined to believe that Grampus was to blame.A MAN SURPRISED AT HIS ORIGINALITY.Among the many acute sayings of La Rochefoucauld, there is hardly one
more acute than this: "La plus grande ambition n'en a pas la moindre
apparence lorsqu'elle se rencontre dans une impossibilite absolue
d'arriver ou elle aspire."Some of us might do well to use this hint in
our treatment of acquaintances and friends from whom we are expecting
gratitude because we are so very kind in thinking of them, inviting
them, and even listening to what they say--considering how insignificant
they must feel themselves to be.We are often fallaciously confident in
supposing that our friend's state of mind is appropriate to our moderate
estimate of his importance: almost as if we imagined the humble mollusc
(so useful as an illustration) to have a sense of his own exceeding
softness and low place in the scale of being.Your mollusc, on the
contrary, is inwardly objecting to every other grade of solid rather
than to himself.Accustomed to observe what we think an unwarrantable
conceit exhibiting itself in ridiculous pretensions and forwardness to
play the lion's part, in obvious self-complacency and loud
peremptoriness, we are not on the alert to detect the egoistic claims of
a more exorbitant kind often hidden under an apparent neutrality or an
acquiescence in being put out of the question.Thoughts of this kind occurred to me yesterday when I saw the name of
Lentulus in the obituary.The majority of his acquaintances, I imagine,
have always thought of him as a man justly unpretending and as nobody's
rival; but some of them have perhaps been struck with surprise at his
reserve in praising the works of his contemporaries, and have now and
then felt themselves in need of a key to his remarks on men of celebrity
in various departments.He was a man of fair position, deriving his
income from a business in which he did nothing, at leisure to frequent
clubs and at ease in giving dinners; well-looking, polite, and generally
acceptable in society as a part of what we may call its bread-crumb--the
neutral basis needful for the plums and spice.Why, then, did he speak
of the modern Maro or the modern Flaccus with a peculiarity in his tone
of assent to other people's praise which might almost have led you to
suppose that the eminent poet had borrowed money of him and showed an
indisposition to repay?He had no criticism to offer, no sign of
objection more specific than a slight cough, a scarcely perceptible
pause before assenting, and an air of self-control in his utterance--as
if certain considerations had determined him not to inform against the
so-called poet, who to his knowledge was a mere versifier.If you had
questioned him closely, he would perhaps have confessed that he did
think something better might be done in the way of Eclogues and
Georgics, or of Odes and Epodes, and that to his mind poetry was
something very different from what had hitherto been known under that
name.For my own part, being of a superstitious nature, given readily to
imagine alarming causes, I immediately, on first getting these mystic
hints from Lentulus, concluded that he held a number of entirely
original poems, or at the very least a revolutionary treatise on
poetics, in that melancholy manuscript state to which works excelling
all that is ever printed are necessarily condemned; and I was long timid
in speaking of the poets when he was present.For what might not
Lentulus have done, or be profoundly aware of, that would make my
ignorant impressions ridiculous?One cannot well be sure of the negative
in such a case, except through certain positives that bear witness to
it; and those witnesses are not always to be got hold of.But time
wearing on, I perceived that the attitude of Lentulus towards the
philosophers was essentially the same as his attitude towards the poets;
nay, there was something so much more decided in his mode of closing his
mouth after brief speech on the former, there was such an air of rapt
consciousness in his private hints as to his conviction that all
thinking hitherto had been an elaborate mistake, and as to his own
power of conceiving a sound basis for a lasting superstructure, that I
began to believe less in the poetical stores, and to infer that the line
of Lentulus lay rather in the rational criticism of our beliefs and in
systematic construction.In this case I did not figure to myself the
existence of formidable manuscripts ready for the press; for great
thinkers are known to carry their theories growing within their minds
long before committing them to paper, and the ideas which made a new
passion for them when their locks were jet or auburn, remain perilously
unwritten, an inwardly developing condition of their successive selves,
until the locks are grey or scanty.I only meditated improvingly on the
way in which a man of exceptional faculties, and even carrying within
him some of that fierce refiner's fire which is to purge away the dross
of human error, may move about in society totally unrecognised, regarded
as a person whose opinion is superfluous, and only rising into a power
in emergencies of threatened black-balling.Imagine a Descartes or a
Locke being recognised for nothing more than a good fellow and a
perfect gentleman--what a painful view does such a picture suggest of
impenetrable dulness in the society around them!I would at all times rather be reduced to a cheaper estimate of a
particular person, if by that means I can get a more cheerful view of my
fellow-men generally; and I confess that in a certain curiosity which
led me to cultivate Lentulus's acquaintance, my hope leaned to the
discovery that he was a less remarkable man than he had seemed to imply.It would have been a grief to discover that he was bitter or malicious,
but by finding him to be neither a mighty poet, nor a revolutionary
poetical critic, nor an epoch-making philosopher, my admiration for the
poets and thinkers whom he rated so low would recover all its buoyancy,
and I should not be left to trust to that very suspicious sort of merit
which constitutes an exception in the history of mankind, and recommends
itself as the total abolitionist of all previous claims on our
confidence.You are not greatly surprised at the infirm logic of the
coachman who would persuade you to engage him by insisting that any
other would be sure to rob you in the matter of hay and corn, thus
demanding a difficult belief in him as the sole exception from the
frailties of his calling; but it is rather astonishing that the
wholesale decriers of mankind and its performances should be even more
unwary in their reasoning than the coachman, since each of them not
merely confides in your regarding himself as an exception, but overlooks
the almost certain fact that you are wondering whether he inwardly
excepts _you_.Now, conscious of entertaining some common opinions which
seemed to fall under the mildly intimated but sweeping ban of Lentulus,
my self-complacency was a little concerned.Hence I deliberately attempted to draw out Lentulus in private dialogue,
for it is the reverse of injury to a man to offer him that hearing which
he seems to have found nowhere else.And for whatever purposes silence
may be equal to gold, it cannot be safely taken as an indication of
specific ideas.I sought to know why Lentulus was more than indifferent
to the poets, and what was that new poetry which he had either written
or, as to its principles, distinctly conceived.But I presently found
that he knew very little of any particular poet, and had a general
notion of poetry as the use of artificial language to express unreal
sentiments: he instanced "The Giaour," "Lalla Rookh," "The Pleasures of
Hope," and "Ruin seize thee, ruthless King;" adding, "and plenty more."On my observing that he probably preferred a larger, simpler style, he
emphatically assented."Have you not," said I, "written something of
that order?""No; but I often compose as I go along.I see how things
might be written as fine as Ossian, only with true ideas.The world has
no notion what poetry will be."It was impossible to disprove this, and I am always glad to believe that
the poverty of our imagination is no measure of the world's resources.Our posterity will no doubt get fuel in ways that we are unable to
devise for them.But what this conversation persuaded me of was, that
the birth with which the mind of Lentulus was pregnant could not be
poetry, though I did not question that he composed as he went along, and
that the exercise was accompanied with a great sense of power.This is a
frequent experience in dreams, and much of our waking experience is but
a dream in the daylight.Nay, for what I saw, the compositions might be
fairly classed as Ossianic.But I was satisfied that Lentulus could not
disturb my grateful admiration for the poets of all ages by eclipsing
them, or by putting them under a new electric light of criticism.Still, he had himself thrown the chief emphasis of his protest and his
consciousness of corrective illumination on the philosophic thinking of
our race; and his tone in assuring me that everything which had been
done in that way was wrong--that Plato, Robert Owen, and Dr Tuffle who
wrote in the 'Regulator,' were all equally mistaken--gave my
superstitious nature a thrill of anxiety.After what had passed about
the poets, it did not seem likely that Lentulus had all systems by
heart; but who could say he had not seized that thread which may
somewhere hang out loosely from the web of things and be the clue of
unravelment?We need not go far to learn that a prophet is not made by
erudition.Lentulus at least had not the bias of a school; and if it
turned out that he was in agreement with any celebrated thinker,
ancient or modern, the agreement would have the value of an undesigned
coincidence not due to forgotten reading.It was therefore with renewed
curiosity that I engaged him on this large subject--the universal
erroneousness of thinking up to the period when Lentulus began that
process.And here I found him more copious than on the theme of poetry.He admitted that he did contemplate writing down his thoughts, but his
difficulty was their abundance.Apparently he was like the woodcutter
entering the thick forest and saying, "Where shall I begin?"The same
obstacle appeared in a minor degree to cling about his verbal
exposition, and accounted perhaps for his rather helter-skelter choice
of remarks bearing on the number of unaddressed letters sent to the
post-office; on what logic really is, as tending to support the buoyancy
of human mediums and mahogany tables; on the probability of all miracles
under all religions when explained by hidden laws, and my
unreasonableness in supposing that their profuse occurrence at half a
guinea an hour in recent times was anything more than a coincidence; on
the haphazard way in which marriages are determined--showing the
baselessness of social and moral schemes; and on his expectation that he
should offend the scientific world when he told them what he thought of
electricity as an agent.No man's appearance could be graver or more gentleman-like than that of
Lentulus as we walked along the Mall while he delivered these
observations, understood by himself to have a regenerative bearing on
human society.His wristbands and black gloves, his hat and nicely
clipped hair, his laudable moderation in beard, and his evident
discrimination in choosing his tailor, all seemed to excuse the
prevalent estimate of him as a man untainted with heterodoxy, and likely
to be so unencumbered with opinions that he would always be useful as an
assenting and admiring listener.Men of science seeing him at their
lectures doubtless flattered themselves that he came to learn from them;
the philosophic ornaments of our time, expounding some of their luminous
ideas in the social circle, took the meditative gaze of Lentulus for one
of surprise not unmixed with a just reverence at such close reasoning
towards so novel a conclusion; and those who are called men of the
world considered him a good fellow who might be asked to vote for a
friend of their own and would have no troublesome notions to make him
unaccommodating.You perceive how very much they were all mistaken,
except in qualifying him as a good fellow.This Lentulus certainly was, in the sense of being free from envy,
hatred, and malice; and such freedom was all the more remarkable an
indication of native benignity, because of his gaseous, illimitably
expansive conceit.Yes, conceit; for that his enormous and contentedly
ignorant confidence in his own rambling thoughts was usually clad in a
decent silence, is no reason why it should be less strictly called by
the name directly implying a complacent self-estimate unwarranted by
performance.Nay, the total privacy in which he enjoyed his
consciousness of inspiration was the very condition of its undisturbed
placid nourishment and gigantic growth.Your audibly arrogant man
exposes himself to tests: in attempting to make an impression on others
he may possibly (not always) be made to feel his own lack of
definiteness; and the demand for definiteness is to all of us a needful
check on vague depreciation of what others do, and vague ecstatic trust
in our own superior ability.But Lentulus was at once so unreceptive,
and so little gifted with the power of displaying his miscellaneous
deficiency of information, that there was really nothing to hinder his
astonishment at the spontaneous crop of ideas which his mind secretly
yielded.If it occurred to him that there were more meanings than one
for the word "motive," since it sometimes meant the end aimed at and
sometimes the feeling that prompted the aiming, and that the word
"cause" was also of changeable import, he was naturally struck with the
truth of his own perception, and was convinced that if this vein were
well followed out much might be made of it.Men were evidently in the
wrong about cause and effect, else why was society in the confused state
we behold?And as to motive, Lentulus felt that when he came to write
down his views he should look deeply into this kind of subject and show
up thereby the anomalies of our social institutions; meanwhile the
various aspects of "motive" and "cause" flitted about among the motley
crowd of ideas which he regarded as original, and pregnant with
reformative efficacy.For his unaffected goodwill made him regard all
his insight as only valuable because it tended towards reform.The respectable man had got into his illusory maze of discoveries by
letting go that clue of conformity in his thinking which he had kept
fast hold of in his tailoring and manners.He regarded heterodoxy as a
power in itself, and took his inacquaintance with doctrines for a
creative dissidence.But his epitaph needs not to be a melancholy one.His benevolent disposition was more effective for good than his silent
presumption for harm.He might have been mischievous but for the lack of
words: instead of being astonished at his inspirations in private, he
might have clad his addled originalities, disjointed commonplaces, blind
denials, and balloon-like conclusions, in that mighty sort of language
which would have made a new Koran for a knot of followers.I mean no
disrespect to the ancient Koran, but one would not desire the roc to lay
more eggs and give us a whole wing-flapping brood to soar and make
twilight.Peace be with Lentulus, for he has left us in peace.Blessed is the man
who, having nothing to say, abstains from giving us wordy evidence of
the fact--from calling on us to look through a heap of millet-seed in
order to be sure that there is no pearl in it.V.


A TOO DEFERENTIAL MAN.A little unpremeditated insincerity must be indulged under the stress of
social intercourse.The talk even of an honest man must often represent
merely his wish to be inoffensive or agreeable rather than his genuine
opinion or feeling on the matter in hand.His thought, if uttered, might
be wounding; or he has not the ability to utter it with exactness and
snatches at a loose paraphrase; or he has really no genuine thought on
the question and is driven to fill up the vacancy by borrowing the
remarks in vogue.These are the winds and currents we have all to steer
amongst, and they are often too strong for our truthfulness or our wit.Let us not bear too hardly on each other for this common incidental
frailty, or think that we rise superior to it by dropping all
considerateness and deference.But there are studious, deliberate forms of insincerity which it is fair
to be impatient with: Hinze's, for example.From his name you might
suppose him to be German: in fact, his family is Alsatian, but has been
settled in England for more than one generation.He is the superlatively
deferential man, and walks about with murmured wonder at the wisdom and
discernment of everybody who talks to him.He cultivates the low-toned
_tete-a-tete,_ keeping his hat carefully in his hand and often stroking
it, while he smiles with downcast eyes, as if to relieve his feelings
under the pressure of the remarkable conversation which it is his honour
to enjoy at the present moment.I confess to some rage on hearing him
yesterday talking to Felicia, who is certainly a clever woman, and,
without any unusual desire to show her cleverness, occasionally says
something of her own or makes an allusion which is not quite common.Still, it must happen to her as to every one else to speak of many
subjects on which the best things were said long ago, and in
conversation with a person who has been newly introduced those
well-worn themes naturally recur as a further development of salutations
and preliminary media of understanding, such as pipes, chocolate, or
mastic-chewing, which serve to confirm the impression that our new
acquaintance is on a civilised footing and has enough regard for
formulas to save us from shocking outbursts of individualism, to which
we are always exposed with the tamest bear or baboon.Considered purely
as a matter of information, it cannot any longer be important for us to
learn that a British subject included in the last census holds Shakspere
to be supreme in the presentation of character; still, it is as
admissible for any one to make this statement about himself as to rub
his hands and tell you that the air is brisk, if only he will let it
fall as a matter of course, with a parenthetic lightness, and not
announce his adhesion to a commonplace with an emphatic insistance, as
if it were a proof of singular insight.We mortals should chiefly like
to talk to each other out of goodwill and fellowship, not for the sake
of hearing revelations or being stimulated by witticisms; and I have
usually found that it is the rather dull person who appears to be
disgusted with his contemporaries because they are not always strikingly
original, and to satisfy whom the party at a country house should have
included the prophet Isaiah, Plato, Francis Bacon, and Voltaire.It is
always your heaviest bore who is astonished at the tameness of modern
celebrities: naturally; for a little of his company has reduced them to
a state of flaccid fatigue.It is right and meet that there should be an
abundant utterance of good sound commonplaces.Part of an agreeable
talker's charm is that he lets them fall continually with no more than
their due emphasis.Giving a pleasant voice to what we are all well
assured of, makes a sort of wholesome air for more special and dubious
remark to move in.Hence it seemed to me far from unbecoming in Felicia that in her first
dialogue with Hinze, previously quite a stranger to her, her
observations were those of an ordinarily refined and well-educated woman
on standard subjects, and might have been printed in a manual of polite
topics and creditable opinions.She had no desire to astonish a man of
whom she had heard nothing particular.It was all the more exasperating
to see and hear Hinze's reception of her well-bred conformities.Felicia's acquaintances know her as the suitable wife of a distinguished
man, a sensible, vivacious, kindly-disposed woman, helping her husband
with graceful apologies written and spoken, and making her receptions
agreeable to all comers.But you would have imagined that Hinze had been
prepared by general report to regard this introduction to her as an
opportunity comparable to an audience of the Delphic Sibyl.When she had
delivered herself on the changes in Italian travel, on the difficulty of
reading Ariosto in these busy times, on the want of equilibrium in
French political affairs, and on the pre-eminence of German music, he
would know what to think.Felicia was evidently embarrassed by his
reverent wonder, and, in dread lest she should seem to be playing the
oracle, became somewhat confused, stumbling on her answers rather than
choosing them.But this made no difference to Hinze's rapt attention and
subdued eagerness of inquiry.He continued to put large questions,
bending his head slightly that his eyes might be a little lifted in
awaiting her reply."What, may I ask, is your opinion as to the state of Art in England?""Oh," said Felicia, with a light deprecatory laugh, "I think it suffers
from two diseases--bad taste in the patrons and want of inspiration in
the artists.""That is true indeed," said Hinze, in an undertone of deep conviction."You have put your finger with strict accuracy on the causes of decline.To a cultivated taste like yours this must be particularly painful.""I did not say there was actual decline," said Felicia, with a touch of
_brusquerie_."I don't set myself up as the great personage whom nothing
can please.""That would be too severe a misfortune for others," says my
complimentary ape."You approve, perhaps, of Rosemary's 'Babes in the
Wood,' as something fresh and _naive_ in sculpture?"Or _will_ you permit me to tell him?"It would be an impertinence in me to praise a work of
his--to pronounce on its quality; and that I happen to like it can be of
no consequence to him."Here was an occasion for Hinze to smile down on his hat and stroke
it--Felicia's ignorance that her praise was inestimable being peculiarly
noteworthy to an observer of mankind.Presently he was quite sure that
her favourite author was Shakspere, and wished to know what she thought
of Hamlet's madness.When she had quoted Wilhelm Meister on this point,
and had afterwards testified that "Lear" was beyond adequate
presentation, that "Julius Caesar" was an effective acting play, and
that a poet may know a good deal about human nature while knowing little
of geography, Hinze appeared so impressed with the plenitude of these
revelations that he recapitulated them, weaving them together with
threads of compliment--"As you very justly observed;" and--"It is most
true, as you say;" and--"It were well if others noted what you have
remarked."Some listeners incautious in their epithets would have called Hinze an
"ass."For my part I would never insult that intelligent and
unpretending animal who no doubt brays with perfect simplicity and
substantial meaning to those acquainted with his idiom, and if he feigns
more submission than he feels, has weighty reasons for doing so--I would
never, I say, insult that historic and ill-appreciated animal, the ass,
by giving his name to a man whose continuous pretence is so shallow in
its motive, so unexcused by any sharp appetite as this of Hinze's.But perhaps you would say that his adulatory manner was originally
adopted under strong promptings of self-interest, and that his absurdly
over-acted deference to persons from whom he expects no patronage is the
unreflecting persistence of habit--just as those who live with the deaf
will shout to everybody else.And you might indeed imagine that in talking to Tulpian, who has
considerable interest at his disposal, Hinze had a desired appointment
in his mind.Tulpian is appealed to on innumerable subjects, and if he
is unwilling to express himself on any one of them, says so with
instructive copiousness: he is much listened to, and his utterances are
registered and reported with more or less exactitude.But I think he
has no other listener who comports himself as Hinze does--who,
figuratively speaking, carries about a small spoon ready to pick up any
dusty crumb of opinion that the eloquent man may have let drop.Tulpian,
with reverence be it said, has some rather absurd notions, such as a
mind of large discourse often finds room for: they slip about among his
higher conceptions and multitudinous acquirements like disreputable
characters at a national celebration in some vast cathedral, where to
the ardent soul all is glorified by rainbow light and grand
associations: any vulgar detective knows them for what they are.But
Hinze is especially fervid in his desire to hear Tulpian dilate on his
crotchets, and is rather troublesome to bystanders in asking them
whether they have read the various fugitive writings in which these
crotchets have been published.If an expert is explaining some matter on
which you desire to know the evidence, Hinze teases you with Tulpian's
guesses, and asks the expert what he thinks of them.In general, Hinze delights in the citation of opinions, and would
hardly remark that the sun shone without an air of respectful appeal or
fervid adhesion.The 'Iliad,' one sees, would impress him little if it
were not for what Mr Fugleman has lately said about it; and if you
mention an image or sentiment in Chaucer he seems not to heed the
bearing of your reference, but immediately tells you that Mr Hautboy,
too, regards Chaucer as a poet of the first order, and he is delighted
to find that two such judges as you and Hautboy are at one.What is the reason of all this subdued ecstasy, moving about, hat in
hand, with well-dressed hair and attitudes of unimpeachable correctness?Some persons conscious of sagacity decide at once that Hinze knows what
he is about in flattering Tulpian, and has a carefully appraised end to
serve though they may not see it They are misled by the common mistake
of supposing that men's behaviour, whether habitual or occasional, is
chiefly determined by a distinctly conceived motive, a definite object
to be gained or a definite evil to be avoided.The truth is, that, the
primitive wants of nature once tolerably satisfied, the majority of
mankind, even in a civilised life full of solicitations, are with
difficulty aroused to the distinct conception of an object towards which
they will direct their actions with careful adaptation, and it is yet
rarer to find one who can persist in the systematic pursuit of such an
end.Few lives are shaped, few characters formed, by the contemplation
of definite consequences seen from a distance and made the goal of
continuous effort or the beacon of a constantly avoided danger: such
control by foresight, such vivid picturing and practical logic are the
distinction of exceptionally strong natures; but society is chiefly made
up of human beings whose daily acts are all performed either in
unreflecting obedience to custom and routine or from immediate
promptings of thought or feeling to execute an immediate purpose.They
pay their poor-rates, give their vote in affairs political or parochial,
wear a certain amount of starch, hinder boys from tormenting the
helpless, and spend money on tedious observances called pleasures,
without mentally adjusting these practices to their own well-understood
interest or to the general, ultimate welfare of the human race; and when
they fall into ungraceful compliment, excessive smiling or other
luckless efforts of complaisant behaviour, these are but the tricks or
habits gradually formed under the successive promptings of a wish to be
agreeable, stimulated day by day without any widening resources for
gratifying the wish.It does not in the least follow that they are
seeking by studied hypocrisy to get something for themselves.And so
with Hinze's deferential bearing, complimentary parentheses, and
worshipful tones, which seem to some like the over-acting of a part in a
comedy.He expects no appointment or other appreciable gain through
Tulpian's favour; he has no doubleness towards Felicia; there is no
sneering or backbiting obverse to his ecstatic admiration.He is very
well off in the world, and cherishes no unsatisfied ambition that could
feed design and direct flattery.As you perceive, he has had the
education and other advantages of a gentleman without being conscious of
marked result, such as a decided preference for any particular ideas or
functions: his mind is furnished as hotels are, with everything for
occasional and transient use.But one cannot be an Englishman and
gentleman in general: it is in the nature of things that one must have
an individuality, though it may be of an often-repeated type.As Hinze
in growing to maturity had grown into a particular form and expression
of person, so he necessarily gathered a manner and frame of speech which
made him additionally recognisable.His nature is not tuned to the pitch
of a genuine direct admiration, only to an attitudinising deference
which does not fatigue itself with the formation of real judgments.All
human achievement must be wrought down to this spoon-meat--this mixture
of other persons' washy opinions and his own flux of reverence for what
is third-hand, before Hinze can find a relish for it.He has no more leading characteristic than the desire to stand well with
those who are justly distinguished; he has no base admirations, and you
may know by his entire presentation of himself, from the management of
his hat to the angle at which he keeps his right foot, that he aspires
to correctness.Desiring to behave becomingly and also to make a figure
in dialogue, he is only like the bad artist whose picture is a failure.We may pity these ill-gifted strivers, but not pretend that their works
are pleasant to behold.A man is bound to know something of his own
weight and muscular dexterity, and the puny athlete is called foolish
before he is seen to be thrown.Hinze has not the stuff in him to be at
once agreeably conversational and sincere, and he has got himself up to
be at all events agreeably conversational.Notwithstanding this
deliberateness of intention in his talk he is unconscious of falsity,
for he has not enough of deep and lasting impression to find a contrast
or diversity between his words and his thoughts.He is not fairly to be
called a hypocrite, but I have already confessed to the more
exasperation at his make-believe reverence, because it has no deep
hunger to excuse it.Its primary meaning, the proportion and mode in which
qualities are mingled, is much neglected in popular speech, yet even
here the word often carries a reference to an habitual state or general
tendency of the organism in distinction from what are held to be
specific virtues and vices.As people confess to bad memory without
expecting to sink in mental reputation, so we hear a man declared to
have a bad temper and yet glorified as the possessor of every high
quality.When he errs or in any way commits himself, his temper is
accused, not his character, and it is understood that but for a brutal
bearish mood he is kindness itself.If he kicks small animals, swears
violently at a servant who mistakes orders, or is grossly rude to his
wife, it is remarked apologetically that these things mean nothing--they
are all temper.Certainly there is a limit to this form of apology, and the forgery of a
bill, or the ordering of goods without any prospect of paying for them,
has never been set down to an unfortunate habit of sulkiness or of
irascibility.But on the whole there is a peculiar exercise of
indulgence towards the manifestations of bad temper which tends to
encourage them, so that we are in danger of having among us a number of
virtuous persons who conduct themselves detestably, just as we have
hysterical patients who, with sound organs, are apparently labouring
under many sorts of organic disease.Let it be admitted, however, that a
man may be "a good fellow" and yet have a bad temper, so bad that we
recognise his merits with reluctance, and are inclined to resent his
occasionally amiable behaviour as an unfair demand on our admiration.He is by turns insolent,
quarrelsome, repulsively haughty to innocent people who approach him
with respect, neglectful of his friends, angry in face of legitimate
demands, procrastinating in the fulfilment of such demands, prompted to
rude words and harsh looks by a moody disgust with his fellow-men in
general--and yet, as everybody will assure you, the soul of honour, a
steadfast friend, a defender of the oppressed, an affectionate-hearted
creature.Pity that, after a certain experience of his moods, his
intimacy becomes insupportable!A man who uses his balmorals to tread on
your toes with much frequency and an unmistakeable emphasis may prove a
fast friend in adversity, but meanwhile your adversity has not arrived
and your toes are tender.The daily sneer or growl at your remarks is
not to be made amends for by a possible eulogy or defence of your
understanding against depredators who may not present themselves, and on
an occasion which may never arise.I cannot submit to a chronic state of
blue and green bruise as a form of insurance against an accident.Touchwood's bad temper is of the contradicting pugnacious sort.He is
the honourable gentleman in opposition, whatever proposal or proposition
may be broached, and when others join him he secretly damns their
superfluous agreement, quickly discovering that his way of stating the
case is not exactly theirs.An invitation or any sign of expectation
throws him into an attitude of refusal.Ask his concurrence in a
benevolent measure: he will not decline to give it, because he has a
real sympathy with good aims; but he complies resentfully, though where
he is let alone he will do much more than any one would have thought of
asking for.No man would shrink with greater sensitiveness from the
imputation of not paying his debts, yet when a bill is sent in with any
promptitude he is inclined to make the tradesman wait for the money he
is in such a hurry to get.One sees that this antagonistic temper must
be much relieved by finding a particular object, and that its worst
moments must be those where the mood is that of vague resistance, there
being nothing specific to oppose.Touchwood is never so little engaging
as when he comes down to breakfast with a cloud on his brow, after
parting from you the night before with an affectionate effusiveness at
the end of a confidential conversation which has assured you of mutual
understanding.Impossible that you can have committed any offence.If
mice have disturbed him, that is not your fault; but, nevertheless, your
cheerful greeting had better not convey any reference to the weather,
else it will be met by a sneer which, taking you unawares, may give you
a crushing sense that you make a poor figure with your cheerfulness,
which was not asked for.Some daring person perhaps introduces another
topic, and uses the delicate flattery of appealing to Touchwood for his
opinion, the topic being included in his favourite studies.An
indistinct muttering, with a look at the carving-knife in reply, teaches
that daring person how ill he has chosen a market for his deference.If
Touchwood's behaviour affects you very closely you had better break your
leg in the course of the day: his bad temper will then vanish at once;
he will take a painful journey on your behalf; he will sit up with you
night after night; he will do all the work of your department so as to
save you from any loss in consequence of your accident; he will be even
uniformly tender to you till you are well on your legs again, when he
will some fine morning insult you without provocation, and make you wish
that his generous goodness to you had not closed your lips against
retort.It is not always necessary that a friend should break his leg for
Touchwood to feel compunction and endeavour to make amends for his
bearishness or insolence.He becomes spontaneously conscious that he has
misbehaved, and he is not only ashamed of himself, but has the better
prompting to try and heal any wound he has inflicted.Unhappily the
habit of being offensive "without meaning it" leads usually to a way of
making amends which the injured person cannot but regard as a being
amiable without meaning it.The kindnesses, the complimentary
indications or assurances, are apt to appear in the light of a penance
adjusted to the foregoing lapses, and by the very contrast they offer
call up a keener memory of the wrong they atone for.They are not a
spontaneous prompting of goodwill, but an elaborate compensation.And,
in fact, Dion's atoning friendliness has a ring of artificiality.Because he formerly disguised his good feeling towards you he now
expresses more than he quite feels.Having made you
extremely uncomfortable last week he has absolutely diminished his
power of making you happy to-day: he struggles against this result by
excessive effort, but he has taught you to observe his fitfulness rather
than to be warmed by his episodic show of regard.I suspect that many persons who have an uncertain, incalculable temper
flatter themselves that it enhances their fascination; but perhaps they
are under the prior mistake of exaggerating the charm which they suppose
to be thus strengthened; in any case they will do well not to trust in
the attractions of caprice and moodiness for a long continuance or for
close intercourse.A pretty woman may fan the flame of distant adorers
by harassing them, but if she lets one of them make her his wife, the
point of view from which he will look at her poutings and tossings and
mysterious inability to be pleased will be seriously altered.And if
slavery to a pretty woman, which seems among the least conditional forms
of abject service, will not bear too great a strain from her bad temper
even though her beauty remain the same, it is clear that a man whose
claims lie in his high character or high performances had need impress
us very constantly with his peculiar value and indispensableness, if he
is to test our patience by an uncertainty of temper which leaves us
absolutely without grounds for guessing how he will receive our persons
or humbly advanced opinions, or what line he will take on any but the
most momentous occasions.For it is among the repulsive effects of this bad temper, which is
supposed to be compatible with shining virtues, that it is apt to
determine a man's sudden adhesion to an opinion, whether on a personal
or impersonal matter, without leaving him time to consider his grounds.The adhesion is sudden and momentary, but it either forms a precedent
for his line of thought and action, or it is presently seen to have been
inconsistent with his true mind.This determination of partisanship by
temper has its worst effects in the career of the public man, who is
always in danger of getting so enthralled by his own words that he looks
into facts and questions not to get rectifying knowledge, but to get
evidence that will justify his actual attitude which was assumed under
an impulse dependent on something else than knowledge.There has been
plenty of insistance on the evil of swearing by the words of a master,
and having the judgment uniformly controlled by a "He said it;" but a
much worse woe to befall a man is to have every judgment controlled by
an "I said it"--to make a divinity of his own short-sightedness or
passion-led aberration and explain the world in its honour.There is
hardly a more pitiable degradation than this for a man of high gifts.Hence I cannot join with those who wish that Touchwood, being young
enough to enter on public life, should get elected for Parliament and
use his excellent abilities to serve his country in that conspicuous
manner.For hitherto, in the less momentous incidents of private life,
his capricious temper has only produced the minor evil of inconsistency,
and he is even greatly at ease in contradicting himself, provided he can
contradict you, and disappoint any smiling expectation you may have
shown that the impressions you are uttering are likely to meet with his
sympathy, considering that the day before he himself gave you the
example which your mind is following.He is at least free from those
fetters of self-justification which are the curse of parliamentary
speaking, and what I rather desire for him is that he should produce the
great book which he is generally pronounced capable of writing, and put
his best self imperturbably on record for the advantage of society;
because I should then have steady ground for bearing with his diurnal
incalculableness, and could fix my gratitude as by a strong staple to
that unvarying monumental service.Unhappily, Touchwood's great powers
have been only so far manifested as to be believed in, not demonstrated.Everybody rates them highly, and thinks that whatever he chose to do
would be done in a first-rate manner.Is it his love of disappointing
complacent expectancy which has gone so far as to keep up this
lamentable negation, and made him resolve not to write the comprehensive
work which he would have written if nobody had expected it of him?One can see that if Touchwood were to become a public man and take to
frequent speaking on platforms or from his seat in the House, it would
hardly be possible for him to maintain much integrity of opinion, or to
avoid courses of partisanship which a healthy public sentiment would
stamp with discredit.Say that he were endowed with the purest honesty,
it would inevitably be dragged captive by this mysterious, Protean bad
temper.There would be the fatal public necessity of justifying
oratorical Temper which had got on its legs in its bitter mood and made
insulting imputations, or of keeping up some decent show of consistency
with opinions vented out of Temper's contradictoriness.And words would
have to be followed up by acts of adhesion.Certainly if a bad-tempered man can be admirably virtuous, he must be so
under extreme difficulties.I doubt the possibility that a high order of
character can coexist with a temper like Touchwood's.For it is of the
nature of such temper to interrupt the formation of healthy mental
habits, which depend on a growing harmony between perception,
conviction, and impulse.There may be good feelings, good deeds--for a
human nature may pack endless varieties and blessed inconsistencies in
its windings--but it is essential to what is worthy to be called high
character, that it may be safely calculated on, and that its qualities
shall have taken the form of principles or laws habitually, if not
perfectly, obeyed.If a man frequently passes unjust judgments, takes up false attitudes,
intermits his acts of kindness with rude behaviour or cruel words, and
falls into the consequent vulgar error of supposing that he can make
amends by laboured agreeableness, I cannot consider such courses any the
less ugly because they are ascribed to "temper."Especially I object to
the assumption that his having a fundamentally good disposition is
either an apology or a compensation for his bad behaviour.If his temper
yesterday made him lash the horses, upset the curricle and cause a
breakage in my rib, I feel it no compensation that to-day he vows he
will drive me anywhere in the gentlest manner any day as long as he
lives.Yesterday was what it was, my rib is paining me, it is not a main
object of my life to be driven by Touchwood--and I have no confidence in
his lifelong gentleness.The utmost form of placability I am capable of
is to try and remember his better deeds already performed, and, mindful
of my own offences, to bear him no malice.If the bad-tempered man wants to apologise he had need to do it on a
large public scale, make some beneficent discovery, produce some
stimulating work of genius, invent some powerful process--prove himself
such a good to contemporary multitudes and future generations, as to
make the discomfort he causes his friends and acquaintances a vanishing
quality, a trifle even in their own estimate.The most arrant denier must admit that a man often furthers larger ends
than he is conscious of, and that while he is transacting his particular
affairs with the narrow pertinacity of a respectable ant, he subserves
an economy larger than any purpose of his own.Society is happily not
dependent for the growth of fellowship on the small minority already
endowed with comprehensive sympathy: any molecule of the body politic
working towards his own interest in an orderly way gets his
understanding more or less penetrated with the fact that his interest is
included in that of a large number.I have watched several political
molecules being educated in this way by the nature of things into a
faint feeling of fraternity.But at this moment I am thinking of Spike,
an elector who voted on the side of Progress though he was not inwardly
attached to it under that name.For abstractions are deities having many
specific names, local habitations, and forms of activity, and so get a
multitude of devout servants who care no more for them under their
highest titles than the celebrated person who, putting with forcible
brevity a view of human motives now much insisted on, asked what
Posterity had done for him that he should care for Posterity?To many
minds even among the ancients (thought by some to have been invariably
poetical) the goddess of wisdom was doubtless worshipped simply as the
patroness of spinning and weaving.Now spinning and weaving from a
manufacturing, wholesale point of view, was the chief form under which
Spike from early years had unconsciously been a devotee of Progress.He was a political molecule of the most gentleman-like appearance, not
less than six feet high, and showing the utmost nicety in the care of
his person and equipment.His umbrella was especially remarkable for its
neatness, though perhaps he swung it unduly in walking.His complexion
was fresh, his eyes small, bright, and twinkling.He was seen to great
advantage in a hat and greatcoat--garments frequently fatal to the
impressiveness of shorter figures; but when he was uncovered in the
drawing-room, it was impossible not to observe that his head shelved off
too rapidly from the eyebrows towards the crown, and that his length of
limb seemed to have used up his mind so as to cause an air of
abstraction from conversational topics.He appeared, indeed, to be
preoccupied with a sense of his exquisite cleanliness, clapped his hands
together and rubbed them frequently, straightened his back, and even
opened his mouth and closed it again with a slight snap, apparently for
no other purpose than the confirmation to himself of his own powers in
that line.These are innocent exercises, but they are not such as give
weight to a man's personality.Sometimes Spike's mind, emerging from its
preoccupation, burst forth in a remark delivered with smiling zest; as,
that he did like to see gravel walks well rolled, or that a lady should
always wear the best jewellery, or that a bride was a most interesting
object; but finding these ideas received rather coldly, he would relapse
into abstraction, draw up his back, wrinkle his brows longitudinally,
and seem to regard society, even including gravel walks, jewellery, and
brides, as essentially a poor affair.Indeed his habit of mind was
desponding, and he took melancholy views as to the possible extent of
human pleasure and the value of existence.Especially after he had made
his fortune in the cotton manufacture, and had thus attained the chief
object of his ambition--the object which had engaged his talent for
order and persevering application.For his easy leisure caused him much
_ennui_.He was abstemious, and had none of those temptations to sensual
excess which fill up a man's time first with indulgence and then with
the process of getting well from its effects.He had not, indeed,
exhausted the sources of knowledge, but here again his notions of human
pleasure were narrowed by his want of appetite; for though he seemed
rather surprised at the consideration that Alfred the Great was a
Catholic, or that apart from the Ten Commandments any conception of
moral conduct had occurred to mankind, he was not stimulated to further
inquiries on these remote matters.Yet he aspired to what he regarded as
intellectual society, willingly entertained beneficed clergymen, and
bought the books he heard spoken of, arranging them carefully on the
shelves of what he called his library, and occasionally sitting alone in
the same room with them.But some minds seem well glazed by nature
against the admission of knowledge, and Spike's was one of them.It was
not, however, entirely so with regard to politics.He had had a strong
opinion about the Reform Bill, and saw clearly that the large trading
towns ought to send members.Portraits of the Reform heroes hung framed
and glazed in his library: he prided himself on being a Liberal.In this
last particular, as well as in not giving benefactions and not making
loans without interest, he showed unquestionable firmness.On the Repeal
of the Corn Laws, again, he was thoroughly convinced.His mind was
expansive towards foreign markets, and his imagination could see that
the people from whom we took corn might be able to take the cotton goods
which they had hitherto dispensed with.On his conduct in these
political concerns, his wife, otherwise influential as a woman who
belonged to a family with a title in it, and who had condescended in
marrying him, could gain no hold: she had to blush a little at what was
called her husband's "radicalism"--an epithet which was a very unfair
impeachment of Spike, who never went to the root of anything.But he
understood his own trading affairs, and in this way became a genuine,
constant political element.If he had been born a little later he could
have been accepted as an eligible member of Parliament, and if he had
belonged to a high family he might have done for a member of the
Government.Perhaps his indifference to "views" would have passed for
administrative judiciousness, and he would have been so generally silent
that he must often have been silent in the right place.But this is
empty speculation: there is no warrant for saying what Spike would have
been and known so as to have made a calculable political element, if he
had not been educated by having to manage his trade.A small mind
trained to useful occupation for the satisfying of private need becomes
a representative of genuine class-needs.Spike objected to certain items
of legislation because they hampered his own trade, but his neighbours'
trade was hampered by the same causes; and though he would have been
simply selfish in a question of light or water between himself and a
fellow-townsman, his need for a change in legislation, being shared by
all his neighbours in trade, ceased to be simply selfish, and raised him
to a sense of common injury and common benefit.True, if the law could
have been changed for the benefit of his particular business, leaving
the cotton trade in general in a sorry condition while he prospered,
Spike might not have thought that result intolerably unjust; but the
nature of things did not allow of such a result being contemplated as
possible; it allowed of an enlarged market for Spike only through the
enlargement of his neighbours' market, and the Possible is always the
ultimate master of our efforts and desires.Spike was obliged to
contemplate a general benefit, and thus became public-spirited in spite
of himself.Or rather, the nature of things transmuted his active egoism
into a demand for a public benefit.Certainly if Spike had been born a
marquis he could not have had the same chance of being useful as a
political element.But he might have had the same appearance, have been
equally null in conversation, sceptical as to the reality of pleasure,
and destitute of historical knowledge; perhaps even dimly disliking
Jesuitism as a quality in Catholic minds, or regarding Bacon as the
inventor of physical science.The depths of middle-aged gentlemen's
ignorance will never be known, for want of public examinations in this
branch.THE WATCH-DOG OF KNOWLEDGE

Mordax is an admirable man, ardent in intellectual work,
public-spirited, affectionate, and able to find the right words in
conveying ingenious ideas or elevated feeling.Pity that to all these
graces he cannot add what would give them the utmost finish--the
occasional admission that he has been in the wrong, the occasional frank
welcome of a new idea as something not before present to his mind!But
no: Mordax's self-respect seems to be of that fiery quality which
demands that none but the monarchs of thought shall have an advantage
over him, and in the presence of contradiction or the threat of having
his notions corrected, he becomes astonishingly unscrupulous and cruel
for so kindly and conscientious a man."You are fond of attributing those fine qualities to Mordax," said
Acer, the other day, "but I have not much belief in virtues that are
always requiring to be asserted in spite of appearances against them.True fairness and goodwill show themselves precisely where his are
conspicuously absent.I mean, in recognising claims which the rest of
the world are not likely to stand up for.It does not need much love of
truth and justice in me to say that Aldebaran is a bright star, or Isaac
Newton the greatest of discoverers; nor much kindliness in me to want my
notes to be heard above the rest in a chorus of hallelujahs to one
already crowned.Does the man who has the
ear of the public use his advantage tenderly towards poor fellows who
may be hindered of their due if he treats their pretensions with scorn?That is my test of his justice and benevolence."My answer was, that his system of moral tests might be as delusive as
what ignorant people take to be tests of intellect and learning.If the
scholar or _savant_ cannot answer their haphazard questions on the
shortest notice, their belief in his capacity is shaken.But the
better-informed have given up the Johnsonian theory of mind as a pair of
legs able to walk east or west according to choice.Intellect is no
longer taken to be a ready-made dose of ability to attain eminence (or
mediocrity) in all departments; it is even admitted that application in
one line of study or practice has often a laming effect in other
directions, and that an intellectual quality or special facility which
is a furtherance in one medium of effort is a drag in another.We have
convinced ourselves by this time that a man may be a sage in celestial
physics and a poor creature in the purchase of seed-corn, or even in
theorising about the affections; that he may be a mere fumbler in
physiology and yet show a keen insight into human motives; that he may
seem the "poor Poll" of the company in conversation and yet write with
some humorous vigour.It is not true that a man's intellectual power is
like the strength of a timber beam, to be measured by its weakest point.Why should we any more apply that fallacious standard of what is called
consistency to a man's moral nature, and argue against the existence of
fine impulses or habits of feeling in relation to his actions
generally, because those better movements are absent in a class of cases
which act peculiarly on an irritable form of his egoism?The mistake
might be corrected by our taking notice that the ungenerous words or
acts which seem to us the most utterly incompatible with good
dispositions in the offender, are those which offend ourselves.All
other persons are able to draw a milder conclusion.Laniger, who has a
temper but no talent for repartee, having been run down in a fierce way
by Mordax, is inwardly persuaded that the highly-lauded man is a wolf at
heart: he is much tried by perceiving that his own friends seem to think
no worse of the reckless assailant than they did before; and Corvus, who
has lately been flattered by some kindness from Mordax, is unmindful
enough of Laniger's feeling to dwell on this instance of good-nature
with admiring gratitude.There is a fable that when the badger had been
stung all over by bees, a bear consoled him by a rhapsodic account of
how he himself had just breakfasted on their honey.The badger replied,
peevishly, "The stings are in my flesh, and the sweetness is on your
muzzle."The bear, it is said, was surprised at the badger's want of
altruism.But this difference of sensibility between Laniger and his friends only
mirrors in a faint way the difference between his own point of view and
that of the man who has injured him.If those neutral, perhaps even
affectionate persons, form no lively conception of what Laniger suffers,
how should Mordax have any such sympathetic imagination to check him in
what he persuades himself is a scourging administered by the qualified
man to the unqualified?Depend upon it, his conscience, though active
enough in some relations, has never given him a twinge because of his
polemical rudeness and even brutality.He would go from the room where
he has been tiring himself through the watches of the night in lifting
and turning a sick friend, and straightway write a reply or rejoinder in
which he mercilessly pilloried a Laniger who had supposed that he could
tell the world something else or more than had been sanctioned by the
eminent Mordax--and what was worse, had sometimes really done so.Does
this nullify the genuineness of motive which made him tender to his
suffering friend?It only proves that his arrogant egoism,
set on fire, sends up smoke and flame where just before there had been
the dews of fellowship and pity.He is angry and equips himself
accordingly--with a penknife to give the offender a _comprachico_
countenance, a mirror to show him the effect, and a pair of nailed boots
to give him his dismissal.All this to teach him who the Romans really
were, and to purge Inquiry of incompetent intrusion, so rendering an
important service to mankind.When a man is in a rage and wants to hurt another in consequence, he can
always regard himself as the civil arm of a spiritual power, and all the
more easily because there is real need to assert the righteous efficacy
of indignation.I for my part feel with the Lanigers, and should object
all the more to their or my being lacerated and dressed with salt, if
the administrator of such torture alleged as a motive his care for Truth
and posterity, and got himself pictured with a halo in consequence.In
transactions between fellow-men it is well to consider a little, in the
first place, what is fair and kind towards the person immediately
concerned, before we spit and roast him on behalf of the next century
but one.Wide-reaching motives, blessed and glorious as they are, and of
the highest sacramental virtue, have their dangers, like all else that
touches the mixed life of the earth.They are archangels with awful brow
and flaming sword, summoning and encouraging us to do the right and the
divinely heroic, and we feel a beneficent tremor in their presence; but
to learn what it is they thus summon us to do, we have to consider the
mortals we are elbowing, who are of our own stature and our own
appetites.I cannot feel sure how my voting will affect the condition of
Central Asia in the coming ages, but I have good reason to believe that
the future populations there will be none the worse off because I
abstain from conjectural vilification of my opponents during the present
parliamentary session, and I am very sure that I shall be less injurious
to my contemporaries.On the whole, and in the vast majority of
instances, the action by which we can do the best for future ages is of
the sort which has a certain beneficence and grace for contemporaries.A
sour father may reform prisons, but considered in his sourness he does
harm.The deed of Judas has been attributed to far-reaching views, and
the wish to hasten his Master's declaration of himself as the Messiah.Perhaps--I will not maintain the contrary--Judas represented his motive
in this way, and felt justified in his traitorous kiss; but my belief
that he deserved, metaphorically speaking, to be where Dante saw him, at
the bottom of the Malebolge, would not be the less strong because he was
not convinced that his action was detestable.I refuse to accept a man
who has the stomach for such treachery, as a hero impatient for the
redemption of mankind and for the beginning of a reign when the kisses
shall be those of peace and righteousness.All this is by the way, to show that my apology for Mordax was not
founded on his persuasion of superiority in his own motives, but on the
compatibility of unfair, equivocal, and even cruel actions with a nature
which, apart from special temptations, is kindly and generous; and also
to enforce the need of checks from a fellow-feeling with those whom our
acts immediately (not distantly) concern.Will any one be so hardy as to
maintain that an otherwise worthy man cannot be vain and arrogant?I
think most of us have some interest in arguing the contrary.And it is
of the nature of vanity and arrogance, if unchecked, to become cruel and
self-justifying.There are fierce beasts within: chain them, chain them,
and let them learn to cower before the creature with wider reason.This
is what one wishes for Mordax--that his heart and brain should restrain
the outleap of roar and talons.As to his unwillingness to admit that an idea which he has not
discovered is novel to him, one is surprised that quick intellect and
shrewd observation do not early gather reasons for being ashamed of a
mental trick which makes one among the comic parts of that various actor
Conceited Ignorance.I have a sort of valet and factotum, an excellent, respectable servant,
whose spelling is so unvitiated by non-phonetic superfluities that he
writes _night_ as _nit_.One day, looking over his accounts, I said to
him jocosely, "You are in the latest fashion with your spelling, Pummel:
most people spell "night" with a _gh_ between the _i_ and the _t_, but
the greatest scholars now spell it as you do.""So I suppose, sir,"
says Pummel; "I've see it with a _gh_, but I've noways give into that
myself."You would never catch Pummel in an interjection of surprise.I
have sometimes laid traps for his astonishment, but he has escaped them
all, either by a respectful neutrality, as of one who would not appear
to notice that his master had been taking too much wine, or else by that
strong persuasion of his all-knowingness which makes it simply
impossible for him to feel himself newly informed.If I tell him that
the world is spinning round and along like a top, and that he is
spinning with it, he says, "Yes, I've heard a deal of that in my time,
sir," and lifts the horizontal lines of his brow a little higher,
balancing his head from side to side as if it were too painfully full.Whether I tell him that they cook puppies in China, that there are ducks
with fur coats in Australia, or that in some parts of the world it is
the pink of politeness to put your tongue out on introduction to a
respectable stranger, Pummel replies, "So I suppose, sir," with an air
of resignation to hearing my poor version of well-known things, such as
elders use in listening to lively boys lately presented with an
anecdote book.His utmost concession is, that what you state is what he
would have supplied if you had given him _carte blanche_ instead of your
needless instruction, and in this sense his favourite answer is, "I
should say.""Pummel," I observed, a little irritated at not getting my coffee, "if
you were to carry your kettle and spirits of wine up a mountain of a
morning, your water would boil there sooner.""Or,
there are boiling springs in Iceland."That's
what I've been thinking, sir."I have taken to asking him hard questions, and as I expected, he never
admits his own inability to answer them without representing it as
common to the human race."What is the cause of the tides, Pummel?"Many gives their opinion, but if I
was to give mine, it 'ud be different."But while he is never surprised himself, he is constantly imagining
situations of surprise for others.His own consciousness is that of one
so thoroughly soaked in knowledge that further absorption is
impossible, but his neighbours appear to him to be in the state of
thirsty sponges which it is a charity to besprinkle.His great
interest in thinking of foreigners is that they must be surprised at
what they see in England, and especially at the beef.He is often
occupied with the surprise Adam must have felt at the sight of the
assembled animals--"for he was not like us, sir, used from a b'y to
Wombwell's shows."He is fond of discoursing to the lad who acts as
shoe-black and general subaltern, and I have overheard him saying to
that small upstart, with some severity, "Now don't you pretend to know,
because the more you pretend the more I see your ignirance"--a lucidity
on his part which has confirmed my impression that the thoroughly
self-satisfied person is the only one fully to appreciate the charm of
humility in others.Your diffident self-suspecting mortal is not very angry that others
should feel more comfortable about themselves, provided they are not
otherwise offensive: he is rather like the chilly person, glad to sit
next a warmer neighbour; or the timid, glad to have a courageous
fellow-traveller.It cheers him to observe the store of small comforts
that his fellow-creatures may find in their self-complacency, just as
one is pleased to see poor old souls soothed by the tobacco and snuff
for which one has neither nose nor stomach oneself.But your arrogant man will not tolerate a presumption which he sees to
be ill-founded.The service he regards society as most in need of is to
put down the conceit which is so particularly rife around him that he is
inclined to believe it the growing characteristic of the present age.In
the schools of Magna Graecia, or in the sixth century of our era, or
even under Kublai Khan, he finds a comparative freedom from that
presumption by which his contemporaries are stirring his able gall.The
way people will now flaunt notions which are not his without appearing
to mind that they are not his, strikes him as especially disgusting.It
might seem surprising to us that one strongly convinced of his own value
should prefer to exalt an age in which _he_ did not flourish, if it were
not for the reflection that the present age is the only one in which
anybody has appeared to undervalue him.A HALF-BREED

An early deep-seated love to which we become faithless has its unfailing
Nemesis, if only in that division of soul which narrows all newer joys
by the intrusion of regret and the established presentiment of change.I
refer not merely to the love of a person, but to the love of ideas,
practical beliefs, and social habits.And faithlessness here means not a
gradual conversion dependent on enlarged knowledge, but a yielding to
seductive circumstance; not a conviction that the original choice was a
mistake, but a subjection to incidents that flatter a growing desire.In
this sort of love it is the forsaker who has the melancholy lot; for an
abandoned belief may be more effectively vengeful than Dido.The child
of a wandering tribe caught young and trained to polite life, if he
feels an hereditary yearning can run away to the old wilds and get his
nature into tune.But there is no such recovery possible to the man who
remembers what he once believed without being convinced that he was in
error, who feels within him unsatisfied stirrings towards old beloved
habits and intimacies from which he has far receded without conscious
justification or unwavering sense of superior attractiveness in the new.This involuntary renegade has his character hopelessly jangled and out
of tune.He is like an organ with its stops in the lawless condition of
obtruding themselves without method, so that hearers are amazed by the
most unexpected transitions--the trumpet breaking in on the flute, and
the oboee confounding both.Hence the lot of Mixtus affects me pathetically, notwithstanding that he
spends his growing wealth with liberality and manifest enjoyment.To
most observers he appears to be simply one of the fortunate and also
sharp commercial men who began with meaning to be rich and have become
what they meant to be: a man never taken to be well-born, but
surprisingly better informed than the well-born usually are, and
distinguished among ordinary commercial magnates by a personal kindness
which prompts him not only to help the suffering in a material way
through his wealth, but also by direct ministration of his own; yet with
all this, diffusing, as it were, the odour of a man delightedly
conscious of his wealth as an equivalent for the other social
distinctions of rank and intellect which he can thus admire without
envying.Hardly one among those superficial observers can suspect that
he aims or has ever aimed at being a writer; still less can they imagine
that his mind is often moved by strong currents of regret and of the
most unworldly sympathies from the memories of a youthful time when his
chosen associates were men and women whose only distinction was a
religious, a philanthropic, or an intellectual enthusiasm, when the lady
on whose words his attention most hung was a writer of minor religious
literature, when he was a visitor and exhorter of the poor in the alleys
of a great provincial town, and when he attended the lectures given
specially to young men by Mr Apollos, the eloquent congregational
preacher, who had studied in Germany and had liberal advanced views then
far beyond the ordinary teaching of his sect.At that time Mixtus
thought himself a young man of socially reforming ideas, of religious
principles and religious yearnings.It was within his prospects also to
be rich, but he looked forward to a use of his riches chiefly for
reforming and religious purposes.His opinions were of a strongly
democratic stamp, except that even then, belonging to the class of
employers, he was opposed to all demands in the employed that would
restrict the expansiveness of trade.He was the most democratic in
relation to the unreasonable privileges of the aristocracy and landed
interest; and he had also a religious sense of brotherhood with the
poor.Altogether, he was a sincerely benevolent young man, interested in
ideas, and renouncing personal ease for the sake of study, religious
communion, and good works.If you had known him then you would have
expected him to marry a highly serious and perhaps literary woman,
sharing his benevolent and religious habits, and likely to encourage
his studies--a woman who along with himself would play a distinguished
part in one of the most enlightened religious circles of a great
provincial capital.How is it that Mixtus finds himself in a London mansion, and in society
totally unlike that which made the ideal of his younger years?Why, he married Scintilla, who fascinated him as she had fascinated
others, by her prettiness, her liveliness, and her music.It is a common
enough case, that of a man being suddenly captivated by a woman nearly
the opposite of his ideal; or if not wholly captivated, at least
effectively captured by a combination of circumstances along with an
unwarily manifested inclination which might otherwise have been
transient.Mixtus was captivated and then captured on the worldly side
of his disposition, which had been always growing and flourishing side
by side with his philanthropic and religious tastes.He had ability in
business, and he had early meant to be rich; also, he was getting rich,
and the taste for such success was naturally growing with the pleasure
of rewarded exertion.It was during a business sojourn in London that he
met Scintilla, who, though without fortune, associated with families of
Greek merchants living in a style of splendour, and with artists
patronised by such wealthy entertainers.Mixtus on this occasion became
familiar with a world in which wealth seemed the key to a more brilliant
sort of dominance than that of a religious patron in the provincial
circles of X. Would it not be possible to unite the two kinds of sway?A
man bent on the most useful ends might, _with a fortune large enough_,
make morality magnificent, and recommend religious principle by showing
it in combination with the best kind of house and the most liberal of
tables; also with a wife whose graces, wit, and accomplishments gave a
finish sometimes lacking even to establishments got up with that
unhesitating worldliness to which high cost is a sufficient reason.Now this lively lady knew nothing of
Nonconformists, except that they were unfashionable: she did not
distinguish one conventicle from another, and Mr Apollos with his
enlightened interpretations seemed to her as heavy a bore, if not quite
so ridiculous, as Mr Johns could have been with his solemn twang at the
Baptist chapel in the lowest suburbs, or as a local preacher among the
Methodists.In general, people who appeared seriously to believe in any
sort of doctrine, whether religious, social, or philosophical, seemed
rather absurd to Scintilla.Ten to one these theoretic people pronounced
oddly, had some reason or other for saying that the most agreeable
things were wrong, wore objectionable clothes, and wanted you to
subscribe to something.They were probably ignorant of art and music,
did not understand _badinage_, and, in fact, could talk of nothing
amusing.In Scintilla's eyes the majority of persons were ridiculous and
deplorably wanting in that keen perception of what was good taste, with
which she herself was blest by nature and education; but the people
understood to be religious or otherwise theoretic, were the most
ridiculous of all, without being proportionately amusing and invitable.Did Mixtus not discover this view of Scintilla's before their marriage?Or did he allow her to remain in ignorance of habits and opinions which
had made half the occupation of his youth?When a man is inclined to marry a particular woman, and has made any
committal of himself, this woman's opinions, however different from his
own, are readily regarded as part of her pretty ways, especially if they
are merely negative; as, for example, that she does not insist on the
Trinity or on the rightfulness or expediency of church rates, but simply
regards her lover's troubling himself in disputation on these heads as
stuff and nonsense.The man feels his own superior strength, and is sure
that marriage will make no difference to him on the subjects about which
he is in earnest.And to laugh at men's affairs is a woman's privilege,
tending to enliven the domestic hearth.If Scintilla had no liking for
the best sort of nonconformity, she was without any troublesome bias
towards Episcopacy, Anglicanism, and early sacraments, and was quite
contented not to go to church.As to Scintilla's acquaintance with her lover's tastes on these
subjects, she was equally convinced on her side that a husband's queer
ways while he was a bachelor would be easily laughed out of him when he
had married an adroit woman.Mixtus, she felt, was an excellent
creature, quite likable, who was getting rich; and Scintilla meant to
have all the advantages of a rich man's wife.She was not in the least a
wicked woman; she was simply a pretty animal of the ape kind, with an
aptitude for certain accomplishments which education had made the most
of.But we have seen what has been the result to poor Mixtus.He has become
richer even than he dreamed of being, has a little palace in London, and
entertains with splendour the half-aristocratic, professional, and
artistic society which he is proud to think select.This society regards
him as a clever fellow in his particular branch, seeing that he has
become a considerable capitalist, and as a man desirable to have on the
list of one's acquaintance.But from every other point of view Mixtus
finds himself personally submerged: what he happens to think is not felt
by his esteemed guests to be of any consequence, and what he used to
think with the ardour of conviction he now hardly ever expresses.He is
transplanted, and the sap within him has long been diverted into other
than the old lines of vigorous growth.How could he speak to the artist
Crespi or to Sir Hong Kong Bantam about the enlarged doctrine of Mr
Apollos?How could he mention to them his former efforts towards
evangelising the inhabitants of the X. alleys?And his references to his
historical and geographical studies towards a survey of possible markets
for English products are received with an air of ironical suspicion by
many of his political friends, who take his pretension to give advice
concerning the Amazon, the Euphrates, and the Niger as equivalent to the
currier's wide views on the applicability of leather.He can only make a
figure through his genial hospitality.It is in vain that he buys the
best pictures and statues of the best artists.Nobody will call him a
judge in art.If his pictures and statues are well chosen it is
generally thought that Scintilla told him what to buy; and yet Scintilla
in other connections is spoken of as having only a superficial and
often questionable taste.Mixtus, it is decided, is a good fellow, not
ignorant--no, really having a good deal of knowledge as well as sense,
but not easy to classify otherwise than as a rich man.He has
consequently become a little uncertain as to his own point of view, and
in his most unreserved moments of friendly intercourse, even when
speaking to listeners whom he thinks likely to sympathise with the
earlier part of his career, he presents himself in all his various
aspects and feels himself in turn what he has been, what he is, and what
others take him to be (for this last status is what we must all more or
less accept).He will recover with some glow of enthusiasm the vision of
his old associates, the particular limit he was once accustomed to trace
of freedom in religious speculation, and his old ideal of a worthy life;
but he will presently pass to the argument that money is the only means
by which you can get what is best worth having in the world, and will
arrive at the exclamation "Give me money!"with the tone and gesture of
a man who both feels and knows.Then if one of his audience, not having
money, remarks that a man may have made up his mind to do without money
because he prefers something else, Mixtus is with him immediately,
cordially concurring in the supreme value of mind and genius, which
indeed make his own chief delight, in that he is able to entertain the
admirable possessors of these attributes at his own table, though not
himself reckoned among them.Yet, he will proceed to observe, there was
a time when he sacrificed his sleep to study, and even now amid the
press of business he from time to time thinks of taking up the
manuscripts which he hopes some day to complete, and is always
increasing his collection of valuable works bearing on his favourite
topics.And it is true that he has read much in certain directions, and
can remember what he has read; he knows the history and theories of
colonisation and the social condition of countries that do not at
present consume a sufficiently large share of our products and
manufactures.He continues his early habit of regarding the spread of
Christianity as a great result of our commercial intercourse with black,
brown, and yellow populations; but this is an idea not spoken of in the
sort of fashionable society that Scintilla collects round her husband's
table, and Mixtus now philosophically reflects that the cause must come
before the effect, and that the thing to be directly striven for is the
commercial intercourse, not excluding a little war if that also should
prove needful as a pioneer of Christianity.He has long been wont to
feel bashful about his former religion; as if it were an old attachment
having consequences which he did not abandon but kept in decent privacy,
his avowed objects and actual position being incompatible with their
public acknowledgment.There is the same kind of fluctuation in his aspect towards social
questions and duties.He has not lost the kindness that used to make him
a benefactor and succourer of the needy, and he is still liberal in
helping forward the clever and industrious; but in his active
superintendence of commercial undertakings he has contracted more and
more of the bitterness which capitalists and employers often feel to be
a reasonable mood towards obstructive proletaries.Hence many who this
is an idea not spoken of in the sort of fashionable society that
Scintilla collects round her husband's table, and Mixtus now
philosophically reflects that the cause must come before the effect, and
that the thing to be directly striven for is the commercial intercourse,
not excluding a little war if that also should prove needful as a
pioneer of Christianity.He has long been wont to feel bashful about his

more of the bitterness which capitalists and employers often feel to be
a reasonable mood towards obstructive proletaries.Hence many who have
occasionally met him when trade questions were being discussed, conclude
him to be indistinguishable from the ordinary run of moneyed and
money-getting men.Indeed, hardly any of his acquaintances know what
Mixtus really is, considered as a whole--nor does Mixtus himself know
it.X.


DEBASING THE MORAL CURRENCY."Il ne faut pas mettre un ridicule ou il n'y en a point: c'est se gater
le gout, c'est corrompre son jugement et celui des autres.Mais le
ridicule qui est quelque part, il faut l'y voir, l'en tirer avec grace
et d'une maniere qui plaise et qui instruise."I am fond of quoting this passage from La Bruyere, because the subject
is one where I like to show a Frenchman on my side, to save my
sentiments from being set down to my peculiar dulness and deficient
sense of the ludicrous, and also that they may profit by that
enhancement of ideas when presented in a foreign tongue, that glamour of
unfamiliarity conferring a dignity on the foreign names of very common
things, of which even a philosopher like Dugald Stewart confesses the
influence.I remember hearing a fervid woman attempt to recite in
English the narrative of a begging Frenchman who described the violent
death of his father in the July days.The narrative had impressed her,
through the mists of her flushed anxiety to understand it, as something
quite grandly pathetic; but finding the facts turn out meagre, and her
audience cold, she broke off, saying, "It sounded so much finer in
French--_j'ai vu le sang de mon pere_, and so on--I wish I could repeat
it in French."This was a pardonable illusion in an old-fashioned lady
who had not received the polyglot education of the present day; but I
observe that even now much nonsense and bad taste win admiring
acceptance solely by virtue of the French language, and one may fairly
desire that what seems a just discrimination should profit by the
fashionable prejudice in favour of La Bruyere's idiom.But I wish he had
added that the habit of dragging the ludicrous into topics where the
chief interest is of a different or even opposite kind is a sign not of
endowment, but of deficiency.The art of spoiling is within reach of the
dullest faculty: the coarsest clown with a hammer in his hand might
chip the nose off every statue and bust in the Vatican, and stand
grinning at the effect of his work.Because wit is an exquisite product
of high powers, we are not therefore forced to admit the sadly confused
inference of the monotonous jester that he is establishing his
superiority over every less facetious person, and over every topic on
which he is ignorant or insensible, by being uneasy until he has
distorted it in the small cracked mirror which he carries about with him
as a joking apparatus.Some high authority is needed to give many worthy
and timid persons the freedom of muscular repose under the growing
demand on them to laugh when they have no other reason than the peril of
being taken for dullards; still more to inspire them with the courage to
say that they object to the theatrical spoiling for themselves and their
children of all affecting themes, all the grander deeds and aims of men,
by burlesque associations adapted to the taste of rich fishmongers in
the stalls and their assistants in the gallery.The English people in
the present generation are falsely reputed to know Shakspere (as, by
some innocent persons, the Florentine mule-drivers are believed to have
known the _Divina Commedia_, not, perhaps, excluding all the subtle
discourses in the _Purgatorio_ and _Paradiso_); but there seems a clear
prospect that in the coming generation he will be known to them through
burlesques, and that his plays will find a new life as pantomimes.A
bottle-nosed Lear will come on with a monstrous corpulence from which he
will frantically dance himself free during the midnight storm; Rosalind
and Celia will join in a grotesque ballet with shepherds and
shepherdesses; Ophelia in fleshings and a voluminous brevity of
grenadine will dance through the mad scene, finishing with the famous
"attitude of the scissors" in the arms of Laertes; and all the speeches
in "Hamlet" will be so ingeniously parodied that the originals will be
reduced to a mere _memoria technica_ of the improver's puns--premonitory
signs of a hideous millennium, in which the lion will have to lie down
with the lascivious monkeys whom (if we may trust Pliny) his soul
naturally abhors.I have been amazed to find that some artists whose own works have the
ideal stamp, are quite insensible to the damaging tendency of the
burlesquing spirit which ranges to and fro and up and down on the earth,
seeing no reason (except a precarious censorship) why it should not
appropriate every sacred, heroic, and pathetic theme which serves to
make up the treasure of human admiration, hope, and love.One would have
thought that their own half-despairing efforts to invest in worthy
outward shape the vague inward impressions of sublimity, and the
consciousness of an implicit ideal in the commonest scenes, might have
made them susceptible of some disgust or alarm at a species of burlesque
which is likely to render their compositions no better than a dissolving
view, where every noble form is seen melting into its preposterous
caricature.It used to be imagined of the unhappy medieval Jews that
they parodied Calvary by crucifying dogs; if they had been guilty they
would at least have had the excuse of the hatred and rage begotten by
persecution.Are we on the way to a parody which shall have no other
excuse than the reckless search after fodder for degraded
appetites--after the pay to be earned by pasturing Circe's herd where
they may defile every monument of that growing life which should have
kept them human?The world seems to me well supplied with what is genuinely ridiculous:
wit and humour may play as harmlessly or beneficently round the changing
facets of egoism, absurdity, and vice, as the sunshine over the rippling
sea or the dewy meadows.Why should we make our delicious sense of the
ludicrous, with its invigorating shocks of laughter and its
irrepressible smiles which are the outglow of an inward radiation as
gentle and cheering as the warmth of morning, flourish like a brigand on
the robbery of our mental wealth?--or let it take its exercise as a
madman might, if allowed a free nightly promenade, by drawing the
populace with bonfires which leave some venerable structure a blackened
ruin or send a scorching smoke across the portraits of the past, at
which we once looked with a loving recognition of fellowship, and
disfigure them into butts of mockery?--nay, worse--use it to degrade the
healthy appetites and affections of our nature as they are seen to be
degraded in insane patients whose system, all out of joint, finds
matter for screaming laughter in mere topsy-turvy, makes every passion
preposterous or obscene, and turns the hard-won order of life into a
second chaos hideous enough to make one wail that the first was ever
thrilled with light?This is what I call debasing the moral currency: lowering the value of
every inspiring fact and tradition so that it will command less and less
of the spiritual products, the generous motives which sustain the charm
and elevation of our social existence--the something besides bread by
which man saves his soul alive.The bread-winner of the family may
demand more and more coppery shillings, or assignats, or greenbacks for
his day's work, and so get the needful quantum of food; but let that
moral currency be emptied of its value--let a greedy buffoonery debase
all historic beauty, majesty, and pathos, and the more you heap up the
desecrated symbols the greater will be the lack of the ennobling
emotions which subdue the tyranny of suffering, and make ambition one
with social virtue.And yet, it seems, parents will put into the hands of their children
ridiculous parodies (perhaps with more ridiculous "illustrations") of
the poems which stirred their own tenderness or filial piety, and carry
them to make their first acquaintance with great men, great works, or
solemn crises through the medium of some miscellaneous burlesque which,
with its idiotic puns and farcical attitudes, will remain among their
primary associations, and reduce them throughout their time of studious
preparation for life to the moral imbecility of an inward giggle at what
might have stimulated their high emulation or fed the fountains of
compassion, trust, and constancy.One wonders where these parents have
deposited that stock of morally educating stimuli which is to be
independent of poetic tradition, and to subsist in spite of the finest
images being degraded and the finest words of genius being poisoned as
with some befooling drug.Will fine wit, will exquisite humour prosper the more through this
turning of all things indiscriminately into food for a gluttonous
laughter, an idle craving without sense of flavours?That delightful power which La Bruyere points to--"le ridicule qui est
quelque part, il faut l'y voir, l'en tirer avec grace et d'une maniere
qui plaise et qui instruise"--depends on a discrimination only
compatible with the varied sensibilities which give sympathetic insight,
and with the justice of perception which is another name for grave
knowledge.Such a result is no more to be expected from faculties on the
strain to find some small hook by which they may attach the lowest
incongruity to the most momentous subject, than it is to be expected of
a sharper, watching for gulls in a great political assemblage, that he
will notice the blundering logic of partisan speakers, or season his
observation with the salt of historical parallels.But after all our
psychological teaching, and in the midst of our zeal for education, we
are still, most of us, at the stage of believing that mental powers and
habits have somehow, not perhaps in the general statement, but in any
particular case, a kind of spiritual glaze against conditions which we
are continually applying to them.We soak our children in habits of
contempt and exultant gibing, and yet are confident that--as Clarissa
one day said to me--"We can always teach them to be reverent in the
right place, you know."And doubtless if she were to take her boys to
see a burlesque Socrates, with swollen legs, dying in the utterance of
cockney puns, and were to hang up a sketch of this comic scene among
their bedroom prints, she would think this preparation not at all to the
prejudice of their emotions on hearing their tutor read that narrative
of the _Apology_ which has been consecrated by the reverent gratitude of
ages.This is the impoverishment that threatens our posterity:--a new
Famine, a meagre fiend with lewd grin and clumsy hoof, is breathing a
moral mildew over the harvest of our human sentiments.These are the
most delicate elements of our too easily perishable civilisation.And
here again I like to quote a French testimony.Sainte Beuve, referring
to a time of insurrectionary disturbance, says: "Rien de plus prompt a
baisser que la civilisation dans des crises comme celle-ci; on perd en
trois semaines le resultat de plusieurs siecles.La civilisation, la
_vie_ est une chose apprise et inventee, qu'on le sache bien: '_Inventas
aut qui vitam excoluere per artes_.'Les hommes apres quelques annees de
paix oublient trop cette verite: ils arrivent a croire que la _culture_
est chose innee, qu'elle est la meme chose que la _nature_.La
sauvagerie est toujours la a deux pas, et, des qu'on lache pied, elle
recommence."We have been severely enough taught (if we were willing to
learn) that our civilisation, considered as a splendid material fabric,
is helplessly in peril without the spiritual police of sentiments or
ideal feelings.And it is this invisible police which we had need, as a
community, strive to maintain in efficient force.How if a dangerous
"Swing" were sometimes disguised in a versatile entertainer devoted to
the amusement of mixed audiences?And I confess that sometimes when I
see a certain style of young lady, who checks our tender admiration with
rouge and henna and all the blazonry of an extravagant expenditure, with
slang and bold _brusquerie_ intended to signify her emancipated view of
things, and with cynical mockery which she mistakes for penetration, I
am sorely tempted to hiss out "_Petroleuse!_" It is a small matter to
have our palaces set aflame compared with the misery of having our sense
of a noble womanhood, which is the inspiration of a purifying shame, the
promise of life--penetrating affection, stained and blotted out by
images of repulsiveness.These things come--not of higher education,
but--of dull ignorance fostered into pertness by the greedy vulgarity
which reverses Peter's visionary lesson and learns to call all things
common and unclean.The Tirynthians, according to an ancient story reported by Athenaeus,
becoming conscious that their trick of laughter at everything and
nothing was making them unfit for the conduct of serious affairs,
appealed to the Delphic oracle for some means of cure.The god
prescribed a peculiar form of sacrifice, which would be effective if
they could carry it through without laughing.They did their best; but
the flimsy joke of a boy upset their unaccustomed gravity, and in this
way the oracle taught them that even the gods could not prescribe a
quick cure for a long vitiation, or give power and dignity to a people
who in a crisis of the public wellbeing were at the mercy of a poor
jest.THE WASP CREDITED WITH THE HONEYCOMB

No man, I imagine, would object more strongly than Euphorion to
communistic principles in relation to material property, but with regard
to property in ideas he entertains such principles willingly, and is
disposed to treat the distinction between Mine and Thine in original
authorship as egoistic, narrowing, and low.I have known him, indeed,
insist at some expense of erudition on the prior right of an ancient, a
medieval, or an eighteenth century writer to be credited with a view or
statement lately advanced with some show of originality; and this
championship seems to imply a nicety of conscience towards the dead.He
is evidently unwilling that his neighbours should get more credit than
is due to them, and in this way he appears to recognise a certain
proprietorship even in spiritual production.But perhaps it is no real
inconsistency that, with regard to many instances of modern origination,
it is his habit to talk with a Gallic largeness and refer to the
universe: he expatiates on the diffusive nature of intellectual
products, free and all-embracing as the liberal air; on the
infinitesimal smallness of individual origination compared with the
massive inheritance of thought on which every new generation enters; on
that growing preparation for every epoch through which certain ideas or
modes of view are said to be in the air, and, still more metaphorically
speaking, to be inevitably absorbed, so that every one may be excused
for not knowing how he got them.Above all, he insists on the proper
subordination of the irritable self, the mere vehicle of an idea or
combination which, being produced by the sum total of the human race,
must belong to that multiple entity, from the accomplished lecturer or
populariser who transmits it, to the remotest generation of Fuegians or
Hottentots, however indifferent these may be to the superiority of their
right above that of the eminently perishable dyspeptic author.One may admit that such considerations carry a profound truth to be
even religiously contemplated, and yet object all the more to the mode
in which Euphorion seems to apply them.I protest against the use of
these majestic conceptions to do the dirty work of unscrupulosity and
justify the non-payment of conscious debts which cannot be defined or
enforced by the law.Especially since it is observable that the large
views as to intellectual property which can apparently reconcile an
able person to the use of lately borrowed ideas as if they were his
own, when this spoliation is favoured by the public darkness, never
hinder him from joining in the zealous tribute of recognition and
applause to those warriors of Truth whose triumphal arches are seen in
the public ways, those conquerors whose battles and "annexations" even
the carpenters and bricklayers know by name.Surely the acknowledgment
of a mental debt which will not be immediately detected, and may never
be asserted, is a case to which the traditional susceptibility to
"debts of honour" would be suitably transferred.There is no massive
public opinion that can be expected to tell on these relations of
thinkers and investigators&mdash;relations to be thoroughly understood
and felt only by those who are interested in the life of ideas and
acquainted with their history.To lay false claim to an invention or
discovery which has an immediate market value; to vamp up a
professedly new book of reference by stealing from the pages of one
already produced at the cost of much labour and material; to copy
somebody else's poem and send the manuscript to a magazine, or hand it
about among; friends as an original "effusion;" to deliver an elegant
extract from a known writer as a piece of improvised
eloquence:&mdash;these are the limits within which the dishonest
pretence of originality is likely to get hissed or hooted and bring
more or less shame on the culprit.It is not necessary to understand
the merit of a performance, or even to spell with any comfortable
confidence, in order to perceive at once that such pretences are not
respectable.But the difference between these vulgar frauds, these
devices of ridiculous jays whose ill-secured plumes are seen falling
off them as they run, and the quiet appropriation of other people's
philosophic or scientific ideas, can hardly be held to lie in their
moral quality unless we take impunity as our criterion.The pitiable
jays had no presumption in their favour and foolishly fronted an alert
incredulity; but Euphorion, the accomplished theorist, has an audience
who expect much of him, and take it as the most natural thing in the
world that every unusual view which he presents anonymously should be
due solely to his ingenuity.His borrowings are no incongruous
feathers awkwardly stuck on; they have an appropriateness which makes
them seem an answer to anticipation, like the return phrases of a
melody.Certainly one cannot help the ignorant conclusions of polite
society, and there are perhaps fashionable persons who, if a speaker
has occasion to explain what the occipat is, will consider that he has
lately discovered that curiously named portion of the animal frame:
one cannot give a genealogical introduction to every long-stored item
of fact or conjecture that may happen to be a revelation for the large
class of persons who are understood to judge soundly on a small basis
of knowledge.But Euphorion would be very sorry to have it supposed
that he is unacquainted with the history of ideas, and sometimes
carries even into minutiae the evidence of his exact registration of
names in connection with quotable phrases or suggestions: I can
therefore only explain the apparent infirmity of his memory in cases
of larger "conveyance" by supposing that he is accustomed by the very
association of largeness to range them at once under those grand laws
of the universe in the light of which Mine and Thine disappear and are
resolved into Everybody's or Nobody's, and one man's particular
obligations to another melt untraceably into the obligations of the
earth to the solar system in general.Euphorion himself, if a particular omission of acknowledgment were
brought home to him, would probably take a narrower ground of
explanation.It was a lapse of memory; or it did not occur to him as
necessary in this case to mention a name, the source being well
known--or (since this seems usually to act as a strong reason for
mention) he rather abstained from adducing the name because it might
injure the excellent matter advanced, just as an obscure trade-mark
casts discredit on a good commodity, and even on the retailer who has
furnished himself from a quarter not likely to be esteemed first-rate.No doubt this last is a genuine and frequent reason for the
non-acknowledgment of indebtedness to what one may call impersonal as
well as personal sources: even an American editor of school classics
whose own English could not pass for more than a syntactical shoddy of
the cheapest sort, felt it unfavourable to his reputation for sound
learning that he should be obliged to the Penny Cyclopaedia, and
disguised his references to it under contractions in which _Us.took the place of the low word _Penny_.Works of this convenient stamp,
easily obtained and well nourished with matter, are felt to be like rich
but unfashionable relations who are visited and received in privacy, and
whose capital is used or inherited without any ostentatious insistance
on their names and places of abode.As to memory, it is known that this
frail faculty naturally lets drop the facts which are less flattering to
our self-love--when it does not retain them carefully as subjects not to
be approached, marshy spots with a warning flag over them.But it is
always interesting to bring forward eminent names, such as Patricius or
Scaliger, Euler or Lagrange, Bopp or Humboldt.To know exactly what has
been drawn from them is erudition and heightens our own influence, which
seems advantageous to mankind; whereas to cite an author whose ideas may
pass as higher currency under our own signature can have no object
except the contradictory one of throwing the illumination over his
figure when it is important to be seen oneself.All these reasons must
weigh considerably with those speculative persons who have to ask
themselves whether or not Universal Utilitarianism requires that in the
particular instance before them they should injure a man who has been of
service to them, and rob a fellow-workman of the credit which is due to
him.After all, however, it must be admitted that hardly any accusation is
more difficult to prove, and more liable to be false, than that of a
plagiarism which is the conscious theft of ideas and deliberate
reproduction of them as original.The arguments on the side of acquittal
are obvious and strong:--the inevitable coincidences of contemporary
thinking; and our continual experience of finding notions turning up in
our minds without any label on them to tell us whence they came; so that
if we are in the habit of expecting much from our own capacity we accept
them at once as a new inspiration.Then, in relation to the elder
authors, there is the difficulty first of learning and then of
remembering exactly what has been wrought into the backward tapestry of
the world's history, together with the fact that ideas acquired long ago
reappear as the sequence of an awakened interest or a line of inquiry
which is really new in us, whence it is conceivable that if we were
ancients some of us might be offering grateful hecatombs by mistake, and
proving our honesty in a ruinously expensive manner.On the other hand,
the evidence on which plagiarism is concluded is often of a kind which,
though much trusted in questions of erudition and historical criticism,
is apt to lead us injuriously astray in our daily judgments, especially
of the resentful, condemnatory sort.How Pythagoras came by his ideas,
whether St Paul was acquainted with all the Greek poets, what Tacitus
must have known by hearsay and systematically ignored, are points on
which a false persuasion of knowledge is less damaging to justice and
charity than an erroneous confidence, supported by reasoning
fundamentally similar, of my neighbour's blameworthy behaviour in a case
where I am personally concerned.No premisses require closer scrutiny
than those which lead to the constantly echoed conclusion, "He must have
known," or "He must have read."I marvel that this facility of belief on
the side of knowledge can subsist under the daily demonstration that the
easiest of all things to the human mind is _not_ to know and _not_ to
read.To praise, to blame, to shout, grin, or hiss, where others shout,
grin, or hiss--these are native tendencies; but to know and to read are
artificial, hard accomplishments, concerning which the only safe
supposition is, that as little of them has been done as the case admits.An author, keenly conscious of having written, can hardly help imagining
his condition of lively interest to be shared by others, just as we are
all apt to suppose that the chill or heat we are conscious of must be
general, or even to think that our sons and daughters, our pet schemes,
and our quarrelling correspondence, are themes to which intelligent
persons will listen long without weariness.But if the ardent author
happen to be alive to practical teaching he will soon learn to divide
the larger part of the enlightened public into those who have not read
him and think it necessary to tell him so when they meet him in polite
society, and those who have equally abstained from reading him, but wish
to conceal this negation and speak of his "incomparable works" with that
trust in testimony which always has its cheering side.Hence it is worse than foolish to entertain silent suspicions of
plagiarism, still more to give them voice, when they are founded on a
construction of probabilities which a little more attention to everyday
occurrences as a guide in reasoning would show us to be really
worthless, considered as proof.The length to which one man's memory can
go in letting drop associations that are vital to another can hardly
find a limit.It is not to be supposed that a person desirous to make an
agreeable impression on you would deliberately choose to insist to you,
with some rhetorical sharpness, on an argument which you were the first
to elaborate in public; yet any one who listens may overhear such
instances of obliviousness.You naturally remember your peculiar
connection with your acquaintance's judicious views; but why should
_he_?Your fatherhood, which is an intense feeling to you, is only an
additional fact of meagre interest for him to remember; and a sense of
obligation to the particular living fellow-struggler who has helped us
in our thinking, is not yet a form of memory the want of which is felt
to be disgraceful or derogatory, unless it is taken to be a want of
polite instruction, or causes the missing of a cockade on a day of
celebration.In our suspicions of plagiarism we must recognise as the
first weighty probability, that what we who feel injured remember best
is precisely what is least likely to enter lastingly into the memory of
our neighbours.But it is fair to maintain that the neighbour who
borrows your property, loses it for a while, and when it turns up again
forgets your connection with it and counts it his own, shows himself so
much the feebler in grasp and rectitude of mind.Some absent persons
cannot remember the state of wear in their own hats and umbrellas, and
have no mental check to tell them that they have carried home a
fellow-visitor's more recent purchase: they may be excellent
householders, far removed from the suspicion of low devices, but one
wishes them a more correct perception, and a more wary sense that a
neighbours umbrella may be newer than their own.True, some persons are so constituted that the very excellence of an
idea seems to them a convincing reason that it must be, if not solely,
yet especially theirs.It fits in so beautifully with their general
wisdom, it lies implicitly in so many of their manifested opinions, that
if they have not yet expressed it (because of preoccupation) it is
clearly a part of their indigenous produce, and is proved by their
immediate eloquent promulgation of it to belong more naturally and
appropriately to them than to the person who seemed first to have
alighted on it, and who sinks in their all-originating consciousness to
that low kind of entity, a second cause.This is not lunacy, nor
pretence, but a genuine state of mind very effective in practice, and
often carrying the public with it, so that the poor Columbus is found to
be a very faulty adventurer, and the continent is named after Amerigo.Lighter examples of this instinctive appropriation are constantly met
with among brilliant talkers.Aquila is too agreeable and amusing for
any one who is not himself bent on display to be angry at his
conversational rapine--his habit of darting down on every morsel of
booty that other birds may hold in their beaks, with an innocent air, as
if it were all intended for his use, and honestly counted on by him as a
tribute in kind.Hardly any man, I imagine, can have had less trouble in
gathering a showy stock of information than Aquila.On close inquiry you
would probably find that he had not read one epoch-making book of modern
times, for he has a career which obliges him to much correspondence and
other official work, and he is too fond of being in company to spend his
leisure moments in study; but to his quick eye, ear, and tongue, a few
predatory excursions in conversation where there are instructed persons,
gradually furnish surprisingly clever modes of statement and allusion on
the dominant topic.When he first adopts a subject he necessarily falls
into mistakes, and it is interesting to watch his gradual progress into
fuller information and better nourished irony, without his ever needing
to admit that he has made a blunder or to appear conscious of
correction.Suppose, for example, he had incautiously founded some
ingenious remarks on a hasty reckoning that nine thirteens made a
hundred and two, and the insignificant Bantam, hitherto silent, seemed
to spoil the flow of ideas by stating that the product could not be
taken as less than a hundred and seventeen, Aquila would glide on in the
most graceful manner from a repetition of his previous remark to the
continuation--"All this is on the supposition that a hundred and two
were all that could be got out of nine thirteens; but as all the world
knows that nine thirteens will yield," &c.--proceeding straightway into
a new train of ingenious consequences, and causing Bantam to be regarded
by all present as one of those slow persons who take irony for
ignorance, and who would warn the weasel to keep awake.How should a
small-eyed, feebly crowing mortal like him be quicker in arithmetic than
the keen-faced forcible Aquila, in whom universal knowledge is easily
credible?Looked into closely, the conclusion from a man's profile,
voice, and fluency to his certainty in multiplication beyond the
twelves, seems to show a confused notion of the way in which very common
things are connected; but it is on such false correlations that men
found half their inferences about each other, and high places of trust
may sometimes be held on no better foundation.It is a commonplace that words, writings, measures, and performances in
general, have qualities assigned them not by a direct judgment on the
performances themselves, but by a presumption of what they are likely to
be, considering who is the performer.We all notice in our neighbours
this reference to names as guides in criticism, and all furnish
illustrations of it in our own practice; for, check ourselves as we
will, the first impression from any sort of work must depend on a
previous attitude of mind, and this will constantly be determined by the
influences of a name.But that our prior confidence or want of
confidence in given names is made up of judgments just as hollow as the
consequent praise or blame they are taken to warrant, is less commonly
perceived, though there is a conspicuous indication of it in the
surprise or disappointment often manifested in the disclosure of an
authorship about which everybody has been making wrong guesses.No doubt
if it had been discovered who wrote the 'Vestiges,' many an ingenious
structure of probabilities would have been spoiled, and some disgust
might have been felt for a real author who made comparatively so shabby
an appearance of likelihood.It is this foolish trust in prepossessions,
founded on spurious evidence, which makes a medium of encouragement for
those who, happening to have the ear of the public, give other people's
ideas the advantage of appearing under their own well-received name,
while any remonstrance from the real producer becomes an each person who
has paid complimentary tributes in the wrong place.Hardly any kind of false reasoning is more ludicrous than this on the
probabilities of origination.It would be amusing to catechise the
guessers as to their exact reasons for thinking their guess "likely:"
why Hoopoe of John's has fixed on Toucan of Magdalen; why Shrike
attributes its peculiar style to Buzzard, who has not hitherto been
known as a writer; why the fair Columba thinks it must belong to the
reverend Merula; and why they are all alike disturbed in their previous
judgment of its value by finding that it really came from Skunk, whom
they had either not thought of at all, or thought of as belonging to a
species excluded by the nature of the case.Clearly they were all wrong
in their notion of the specific conditions, which lay unexpectedly in
the small Skunk, and in him alone--in spite of his education nobody
knows where, in spite of somebody's knowing his uncles and cousins, and
in spite of nobody's knowing that he was cleverer than they thought him.Such guesses remind one of a fabulist's imaginary council of animals
assembled to consider what sort of creature had constructed a honeycomb
found and much tasted by Bruin and other epicures.The speakers all
started from the probability that the maker was a bird, because this was
the quarter from which a wondrous nest might be expected; for the
animals at that time, knowing little of their own history, would have
rejected as inconceivable the notion that a nest could be made by a
fish; and as to the insects, they were not willingly received in society
and their ways were little known.Several complimentary presumptions
were expressed that the honeycomb was due to one or the other admired
and popular bird, and there was much fluttering on the part of the
Nightingale and Swallow, neither of whom gave a positive denial, their
confusion perhaps extending to their sense of identity; but the Owl
hissed at this folly, arguing from his particular knowledge that the
animal which produced honey must be the Musk-rat, the wondrous nature of
whose secretions required no proof; and, in the powerful logical
procedure of the Owl, from musk to honey was but a step.Some
disturbance arose hereupon, for the Musk-rat began to make himself
obtrusive, believing in the Owl's opinion of his powers, and feeling
that he could have produced the honey if he had thought of it; until an
experimental Butcher-bird proposed to anatomise him as a help to
decision.The hubbub increased, the opponents of the Musk-rat inquiring
who his ancestors were; until a diversion was created by an able
discourse of the Macaw on structures generally, which he classified so
as to include the honeycomb, entering into so much admirable exposition
that there was a prevalent sense of the honeycomb having probably been
produced by one who understood it so well.But Bruin, who had probably
eaten too much to listen with edification, grumbled in his low kind of
language, that "Fine words butter no parsnips," by which he meant to say
that there was no new honey forthcoming.Perhaps the audience generally was beginning to tire, when the Fox
entered with his snout dreadfully swollen, and reported that the
beneficent originator in question was the Wasp, which he had found much
smeared with undoubted honey, having applied his nose to it--whence
indeed the able insect, perhaps justifiably irritated at what might seem
a sign of scepticism, had stung him with some severity, an infliction
Reynard could hardly regret, since the swelling of a snout normally so
delicate would corroborate his statement and satisfy the assembly that
he had really found the honey-creating genius.The Fox's admitted acuteness, combined with the visible swelling, were
taken as undeniable evidence, and the revelation undoubtedly met a
general desire for information on a point of interest.Nevertheless,
there was a murmur the reverse of delighted, and the feelings of some
eminent animals were too strong for them: the Orang-outang's jaw dropped
so as seriously to impair the vigour of his expression, the edifying
Pelican screamed and flapped her wings, the Owl hissed again, the Macaw
became loudly incoherent, and the Gibbon gave his hysterical laugh;
while the Hyaena, after indulging in a more splenetic guffaw, agitated
the question whether it would not be better to hush up the whole affair,
instead of giving public recognition to an insect whose produce, it was
now plain, had been much overestimated.But this narrow-spirited motion
was negatived by the sweet-toothed majority.A complimentary deputation
to the Wasp was resolved on, and there was a confident hope that this
diplomatic measure would tell on the production of honey.Ganymede was once a girlishly handsome precocious youth.That one cannot
for any considerable number of years go on being youthful, girlishly
handsome, and precocious, seems on consideration to be a statement as
worthy of credit as the famous syllogistic conclusion, "Socrates was
mortal."But many circumstances have conspired to keep up in Ganymede
the illusion that he is surprisingly young.He was the last born of his
family, and from his earliest memory was accustomed to be commended as
such to the care of his elder brothers and sisters: he heard his mother
speak of him as her youngest darling with a loving pathos in her tone,
which naturally suffused his own view of himself, and gave him the
habitual consciousness of being at once very young and very interesting.Then, the disclosure of his tender years was a constant matter of
astonishment to strangers who had had proof of his precocious talents,
and the astonishment extended to what is called the world at large when
he produced 'A Comparative Estimate of European Nations' before he was
well out of his teens.All comers, on a first interview, told him that
he was marvellously young, and some repeated the statement each time
they saw him; all critics who wrote about him called attention to the
same ground for wonder: his deficiencies and excesses were alike to be
accounted for by the flattering fact of his youth, and his youth was the
golden background which set off his many-hued endowments.Here was
already enough to establish a strong association between his sense of
identity and his sense of being unusually young.But after this he
devised and founded an ingenious organisation for consolidating the
literary interests of all the four continents (subsequently including
Australasia and Polynesia), he himself presiding in the central office,
which thus became a new theatre for the constantly repeated situation of
an astonished stranger in the presence of a boldly scheming
administrator found to be remarkably young.If we imagine with due
charity the effect on Ganymede, we shall think it greatly to his credit
that he continued to feel the necessity of being something more than
young, and did not sink by rapid degrees into a parallel of that
melancholy object, a superannuated youthful phenomenon.Happily he had
enough of valid, active faculty to save him from that tragic fate.He
had not exhausted his fountain of eloquent opinion in his 'Comparative
Estimate,' so as to feel himself, like some other juvenile celebrities,
the sad survivor of his own manifest destiny, or like one who has risen
too early in the morning, and finds all the solid day turned into a
fatigued afternoon.He has continued to be productive both of schemes
and writings, being perhaps helped by the fact that his 'Comparative
Estimate' did not greatly affect the currents of European thought, and
left him with the stimulating hope that he had not done his best, but
might yet produce what would make his youth more surprising than ever.I saw something of him through his Antinoues period, the time of rich
chesnut locks, parted not by a visible white line, but by a shadowed
furrow from which they fell in massive ripples to right and left.In
these slim days he looked the younger for being rather below the middle
size, and though at last one perceived him contracting an indefinable
air of self-consciousness, a slight exaggeration of the facial
movements, the attitudes, the little tricks, and the romance in
shirt-collars, which must be expected from one who, in spite of his
knowledge, was so exceedingly young, it was impossible to say that he
was making any great mistake about himself.He was only undergoing one
form of a common moral disease: being strongly mirrored for himself in
the remark of others, he was getting to see his real characteristics as
a dramatic part, a type to which his doings were always in
correspondence.Owing to my absence on travel and to other causes I had
lost sight of him for several years, but such a separation between two
who have not missed each other seems in this busy century only a
pleasant reason, when they happen to meet again in some old accustomed
haunt, for the one who has stayed at home to be more communicative about
himself than he can well be to those who have all along been in his
neighbourhood.He had married in the interval, and as if to keep up his
surprising youthfulness in all relations, he had taken a wife
considerably older than himself.It would probably have seemed to him a
disturbing inversion of the natural order that any one very near to him
should have been younger than he, except his own children who, however
young, would not necessarily hinder the normal surprise at the
youthfulness of their father.And if my glance had revealed my
impression on first seeing him again, he might have received a rather
disagreeable shock, which was far from my intention.My mind, having
retained a very exact image of his former appearance, took note of
unmistakeable changes such as a painter would certainly not have made by
way of flattering his subject.He had lost his slimness, and that curved
solidity which might have adorned a taller man was a rather sarcastic
threat to his short figure.The English branch of the Teutonic race does
not produce many fat youths, and I have even heard an American lady say
that she was much "disappointed" at the moderate number and size of our
fat men, considering their reputation in the United States; hence a
stranger would now have been apt to remark that Ganymede was unusually
plump for a distinguished writer, rather than unusually young.Many long-standing prepossessions are as hard to be
corrected as a long-standing mispronunciation, against which the direct
experience of eye and ear is often powerless.And I could perceive that
Ganymede's inwrought sense of his surprising youthfulness had been
stronger than the superficial reckoning of his years and the merely
optical phenomena of the looking-glass.He now held a post under
Government, and not only saw, like most subordinate functionaries, how
ill everything was managed, but also what were the changes that a high
constructive ability would dictate; and in mentioning to me his own
speeches and other efforts towards propagating reformatory views in his
department, he concluded by changing his tone to a sentimental head
voice and saying--

"But I am so young; people object to any prominence on my part; I can
only get myself heard anonymously, and when some attention has been
drawn the name is sure to creep out.The writer is known to be young,
and things are none the forwarder.""Well," said I, "youth seems the only drawback that is sure to diminish.You and I have seven years less of it than when we last met."returned Ganymede, as lightly as possible, at the same time
casting an observant glance over me, as if he were marking the effect of
seven years on a person who had probably begun life with an old look,
and even as an infant had given his countenance to that significant
doctrine, the transmigration of ancient souls into modern bodies.I left him on that occasion without any melancholy forecast that his
illusion would be suddenly or painfully broken up.I saw that he was
well victualled and defended against a ten years' siege from ruthless
facts; and in the course of time observation convinced me that his
resistance received considerable aid from without.Each of his written
productions, as it came out, was still commented on as the work of a
very young man.One critic, finding that he wanted solidity, charitably
referred to his youth as an excuse.Another, dazzled by his brilliancy,
seemed to regard his youth as so wondrous that all other authors
appeared decrepit by comparison, and their style such as might be looked
for from gentlemen of the old school.Able pens (according to a familiar
metaphor) appeared to shake their heads good-humouredly, implying that
Ganymede's crudities were pardonable in one so exceedingly young.Such
unanimity amid diversity, which a distant posterity might take for
evidence that on the point of age at least there could have been no
mistake, was not really more difficult to account for than the
prevalence of cotton in our fabrics.Ganymede had been first introduced
into the writing world as remarkably young, and it was no exceptional
consequence that the first deposit of information about him held its
ground against facts which, however open to observation, were not
necessarily thought of.It is not so easy, with our rates and taxes and
need for economy in all directions, to cast away an epithet or remark
that turns up cheaply, and to go in expensive search after more genuine
substitutes.There is high Homeric precedent for keeping fast hold of an
epithet under all changes of circumstance, and so the precocious author
of the 'Comparative Estimate' heard the echoes repeating "Young
Ganymede" when an illiterate beholder at a railway station would have
given him forty years at least.Besides, important elders, sachems of
the clubs and public meetings, had a genuine opinion of him as young
enough to be checked for speech on subjects which they had spoken
mistakenly about when he was in his cradle; and then, the midway parting
of his crisp hair, not common among English committee-men, formed a
presumption against the ripeness of his judgment which nothing but a
speedy baldness could have removed.It is but fair to mention all these outward confirmations of Ganymede's
illusion, which shows no signs of leaving him.It is true that he no
longer hears expressions of surprise at his youthfulness, on a first
introduction to an admiring reader; but this sort of external evidence
has become an unnecessary crutch to his habitual inward persuasion.His
manners, his costume, his suppositions of the impression he makes on
others, have all their former correspondence with the dramatic part of
the young genius.As to the incongruity of his contour and other little
accidents of physique, he is probably no more aware that they will
affect others as incongruities than Armida is conscious how much her
rouge provokes our notice of her wrinkles, and causes us to mention
sarcastically that motherly age which we should otherwise regard with
affectionate reverence.But let us be just enough to admit that there may be old-young coxcombs
as well as old-young coquettes.HOW WE COME TO GIVE OURSELVES FALSE TESTIMONIALS, AND BELIEVE IN THEM.It is my way when I observe any instance of folly, any queer habit, any
absurd illusion, straightway to look for something of the same type in
myself, feeling sure that amid all differences there will be a certain
correspondence; just as there is more or less correspondence in the
natural history even of continents widely apart, and of islands in
opposite zones.No doubt men's minds differ in what we may call their
climate or share of solar energy, and a feeling or tendency which is
comparable to a panther in one may have no more imposing aspect than
that of a weasel in another: some are like a tropical habitat in which
the very ferns cast a mighty shadow, and the grasses are a dry ocean in
which a hunter may be submerged; others like the chilly latitudes in
which your forest-tree, fit elsewhere to prop a mine, is a pretty
miniature suitable for fancy potting.The eccentric man might be
typified by the Australian fauna, refuting half our judicious
assumptions of what nature allows.Still, whether fate commanded us to
thatch our persons among the Eskimos or to choose the latest thing in
tattooing among the Polynesian isles, our precious guide Comparison
would teach us in the first place by likeness, and our clue to further
knowledge would be resemblance to what we already know.Hence, having a
keen interest in the natural history of my inward self, I pursue this
plan I have mentioned of using my observation as a clue or lantern by
which I detect small herbage or lurking life; or I take my neighbour in
his least becoming tricks or efforts as an opportunity for luminous
deduction concerning the figure the human genus makes in the specimen
which I myself furnish.Introspection which starts with the purpose of finding out one's own
absurdities is not likely to be very mischievous, yet of course it is
not free from dangers any more than breathing is, or the other functions
that keep us alive and active.To judge of others by oneself is in its
most innocent meaning the briefest expression for our only method of
knowing mankind; yet, we perceive, it has come to mean in many cases
either the vulgar mistake which reduces every man's value to the very
low figure at which the valuer himself happens to stand; or else, the
amiable illusion of the higher nature misled by a too generous
construction of the lower.One cannot give a recipe for wise judgment:
it resembles appropriate muscular action, which is attained by the
myriad lessons in nicety of balance and of aim that only practice can
give.The danger of the inverse procedure, judging of self by what one
observes in others, if it is carried on with much impartiality and
keenness of discernment, is that it has a laming effect, enfeebling the
energies of indignation and scorn, which are the proper scourges of
wrong-doing and meanness, and which should continually feed the
wholesome restraining power of public opinion.I respect the horsewhip
when applied to the back of Cruelty, and think that he who applies it is
a more perfect human being because his outleap of indignation is not
checked by a too curious reflection on the nature of guilt--a more
perfect human being because he more completely incorporates the best
social life of the race, which can never be constituted by ideas that
nullify action.This is the essence of Dante's sentiment (it is painful
to think that he applies it very cruelly)--

  "E cortesia fu, lui esser villano"[1]--

and it is undeniable that a too intense consciousness of one's kinship
with all frailties and vices undermines the active heroism which battles
against wrong.But certainly nature has taken care that this danger should not at
present be very threatening.One could not fairly describe the
generality of one's neighbours as too lucidly aware of manifesting in
their own persons the weaknesses which they observe in the rest of her
Majesty's subjects; on the contrary, a hasty conclusion as to schemes of
Providence might lead to the supposition that one man was intended to
correct another by being most intolerant of the ugly quality or trick
which he himself possesses.Doubtless philosophers will be able to
explain how it must necessarily be so, but pending the full extension of
the _a priori_ method, which will show that only blockheads could expect
anything to be otherwise, it does seem surprising that Heloisa should be
disgusted at Laura's attempts to disguise her age, attempts which she
recognises so thoroughly because they enter into her own practice; that
Semper, who often responds at public dinners and proposes resolutions on
platforms, though he has a trying gestation of every speech and a bad
time for himself and others at every delivery, should yet remark
pitilessly on the folly of precisely the same course of action in
Ubique; that Aliquis, who lets no attack on himself pass unnoticed, and
for every handful of gravel against his windows sends a stone in reply,
should deplore the ill-advised retorts of Quispiam, who does not
perceive that to show oneself angry with an adversary is to gratify him.To be unaware of our own little tricks of manner or our own mental
blemishes and excesses is a comprehensible unconsciousness; the puzzling
fact is that people should apparently take no account of their
deliberate actions, and should expect them to be equally ignored by
others.It is an inversion of the accepted order: _there_ it is the
phrases that are official and the conduct or privately manifested
sentiment that is taken to be real; _here_ it seems that the practice is
taken to be official and entirely nullified by the verbal representation
which contradicts it.The thief making a vow to heaven of full
restitution and whispering some reservations, expecting to cheat
Omniscience by an "aside," is hardly more ludicrous than the many ladies
and gentlemen who have more belief, and expect others to have it, in
their own statement about their habitual doings than in the
contradictory fact which is patent in the daylight.One reason of the
absurdity is that we are led by a tradition about ourselves, so that
long after a man has practically departed from a rule or principle, he
continues innocently to state it as a true description of his
practice--just as he has a long tradition that he is not an old
gentleman, and is startled when he is seventy at overhearing himself
called by an epithet which he has only applied to others.[Footnote 1: Inferno, xxxii."A person with your tendency of constitution should take as little sugar
as possible," said Pilulus to Bovis somewhere in the darker decades of
this century."It has made a great difference to Avis since he took my
advice in that matter: he used to consume half a pound a-day.""Twenty-six large lumps every day of your life, Mr Bovis," says his
wife."You drop them into your tea, coffee, and whisky yourself, my dear, and
I count them."laughs Bovis, turning to Pilulus, that they may exchange a
glance of mutual amusement at a woman's inaccuracy.Bovis had never said inwardly that he
would take a large allowance of sugar, and he had the tradition about
himself that he was a man of the most moderate habits; hence, with this
conviction, he was naturally disgusted at the saccharine excesses of
Avis.I have sometimes thought that this facility of men in believing that
they are still what they once meant to be--this undisturbed
appropriation of a traditional character which is often but a melancholy
relic of early resolutions, like the worn and soiled testimonial to
soberness and honesty carried in the pocket of a tippler whom the need
of a dram has driven into peculation--may sometimes diminish the
turpitude of what seems a flat, barefaced falsehood.It is notorious
that a man may go on uttering false assertions about his own acts till
he at last believes in them: is it not possible that sometimes in the
very first utterance there may be a shade of creed-reciting belief, a
reproduction of a traditional self which is clung to against all
evidence?There is no knowing all the disguises of the lying serpent.When we come to examine in detail what is the sane mind in the sane
body, the final test of completeness seems to be a security of
distinction between what we have professed and what we have done; what
we have aimed at and what we have achieved; what we have invented and
what we have witnessed or had evidenced to us; what we think and feel in
the present and what we thought and felt in the past.I know that there is a common prejudice which regards the habitual
confusion of _now_ and _then_, of _it was_ and _it is_, of _it seemed
so_ and _I should like it to be so_, as a mark of high imaginative
endowment, while the power of precise statement and description is rated
lower, as the attitude of an everyday prosaic mind.High imagination is
often assigned or claimed as if it were a ready activity in fabricating
extravagances such as are presented by fevered dreams, or as if its
possessors were in that state of inability to give credible testimony
which would warrant their exclusion from the class of acceptable
witnesses in a court of justice; so that a creative genius might fairly
be subjected to the disability which some laws have stamped on dicers,
slaves, and other classes whose position was held perverting to their
sense of social responsibility.This endowment of mental confusion is often boasted of by persons whose
imaginativeness would not otherwise be known, unless it were by the slow
process of detecting that their descriptions and narratives were not to
be trusted.Callista is always ready to testify of herself that she is
an imaginative person, and sometimes adds in illustration, that if she
had taken a walk and seen an old heap of stones on her way, the account
she would give on returning would include many pleasing particulars of
her own invention, transforming the simple heap into an interesting
castellated ruin.This creative freedom is all very well in the right
place, but before I can grant it to be a sign of unusual mental power, I
must inquire whether, on being requested to give a precise description
of what she saw, she would be able to cast aside her arbitrary
combinations and recover the objects she really perceived so as to make
them recognisable by another person who passed the same way.Otherwise
her glorifying imagination is not an addition to the fundamental power
of strong, discerning perception, but a cheaper substitute.And, in
fact, I find on listening to Callista's conversation, that she has a
very lax conception even of common objects, and an equally lax memory of
events.It seems of no consequence to her whether she shall say that a
stone is overgrown with moss or with lichen, that a building is of
sandstone or of granite, that Meliboeus once forgot to put on his cravat
or that he always appears without it; that everybody says so, or that
one stock-broker's wife said so yesterday; that Philemon praised
Euphemia up to the skies, or that he denied knowing any particular evil
of her.She is one of those respectable witnesses who would testify to
the exact moment of an apparition, because any desirable moment will be
as exact as another to her remembrance; or who would be the most worthy
to witness the action of spirits on slates and tables because the action
of limbs would not probably arrest her attention.She would describe the
surprising phenomena exhibited by the powerful Medium with the same
freedom that she vaunted in relation to the old heap of stones.Her
supposed imaginativeness is simply a very usual lack of discriminating
perception, accompanied with a less usual activity of misrepresentation,
which, if it had been a little more intense, or had been stimulated by
circumstance, might have made her a profuse writer unchecked by the
troublesome need of veracity.These characteristics are the very opposite of such as yield a fine
imagination, which is always based on a keen vision, a keen
consciousness of what _is_, and carries the store of definite knowledge
as material for the construction of its inward visions.Witness Dante,
who is at once the most precise and homely in his reproduction of actual
objects, and the most soaringly at large in his imaginative
combinations.On a much lower level we distinguish the hyperbole and
rapid development in descriptions of persons and events which are lit up
by humorous intention in the speaker--we distinguish this charming play
of intelligence which resembles musical improvisation on a given motive,
where the farthest sweep of curve is looped into relevancy by an
instinctive method, from the florid inaccuracy or helpless exaggeration
which is really something commoner than the correct simplicity often
depreciated as prosaic.Even if high imagination were to be identified with illusion, there
would be the same sort of difference between the imperial wealth of
illusion which is informed by industrious submissive observation and the
trumpery stage-property illusion which depends on the ill-defined
impressions gathered by capricious inclination, as there is between a
good and a bad picture of the Last Judgment.In both these the subject
is a combination never actually witnessed, and in the good picture the
general combination may be of surpassing boldness; but on examination it
is seen that the separate elements have been closely studied from real
objects.And even where we find the charm of ideal elevation with wrong
drawing and fantastic colour, the charm is dependent on the selective
sensibility of the painter to certain real delicacies of form which
confer the expression he longed to render; for apart from this basis of
an effect perceived in common, there could be no conveyance of aesthetic
meaning by the painter to the beholder.In this sense it is as true to
say of Fra Angelico's Coronation of the Virgin, that it has a strain of
reality, as to say so of a portrait by Rembrandt, which also has its
strain of ideal elevation due to Rembrandt's virile selective
sensibility.To correct such self-flatterers as Callista, it is worth
repeating that powerful imagination is not false outward vision, but
intense inward representation, and a creative energy constantly fed by
susceptibility to the veriest minutiae of experience, which it
reproduces and constructs in fresh and fresh wholes; not the habitual
confusion of provable fact with the fictions of fancy and transient
inclination, but a breadth of ideal association which informs every
material object, every incidental fact with far-reaching memories and
stored residues of passion, bringing into new light the less obvious
relations of human existence.The illusion to which it is liable is not
that of habitually taking duck-ponds for lilied pools, but of being more
or less transiently and in varying degrees so absorbed in ideal vision
as to lose the consciousness of surrounding objects or occurrences; and
when that rapt condition is past, the sane genius discriminates clearly
between what has been given in this parenthetic state of excitement, and
what he has known, and may count on, in the ordinary world of
experience.Dante seems to have expressed these conditions perfectly in
that passage of the _Purgatorio_ where, after a triple vision which has
made him forget his surroundings, he says--

  "Quando l'anima mia torno di fuori
    Alle cose che son fuor di lei vere,
    Io riconobbi i miei non falsi errori."--(c xv)

He distinguishes the ideal truth of his entranced vision from the series
of external facts to which his consciousness had returned.Isaiah gives
us the date of his vision in the Temple--"the year that King Uzziah
died"--and if afterwards the mighty-winged seraphim were present with
him as he trod the street, he doubtless knew them for images of memory,
and did not cry "Look!"Certainly the seer, whether prophet, philosopher, scientific discoverer,
or poet, may happen to be rather mad: his powers may have been used up,
like Don Quixote's, in their visionary or theoretic constructions, so
that the reports of common-sense fail to affect him, or the continuous
strain of excitement may have robbed his mind of its elasticity.It is
hard for our frail mortality to carry the burthen of greatness with
steady gait and full alacrity of perception.But he is the strongest
seer who can support the stress of creative energy and yet keep that
sanity of expectation which consists in distinguishing, as Dante does,
between the _cose che son vere_ outside the individual mind, and the
_non falsi errori_ which are the revelations of true imaginative power.THE TOO READY WRITER

One who talks too much, hindering the rest of the company from taking
their turn, and apparently seeing no reason why they should not rather
desire to know his opinion or experience in relation to all subjects, or
at least to renounce the discussion of any topic where he can make no
figure, has never been praised for this industrious monopoly of work
which others would willingly have shared in.However various and
brilliant his talk may be, we suspect him of impoverishing us by
excluding the contributions of other minds, which attract our curiosity
the more because he has shut them up in silence.Besides, we get tired
of a "manner" in conversation as in painting, when one theme after
another is treated with the same lines and touches.I begin with a
liking for an estimable master, but by the time he has stretched his
interpretation of the world unbrokenly along a palatial gallery, I have
had what the cautious Scotch mind would call "enough" of him.There is
monotony and narrowness already to spare in my own identity; what comes
to me from without should be larger and more impartial than the judgment
of any single interpreter.On this ground even a modest person, without
power or will to shine in the conversation, may easily find the
predominating talker a nuisance, while those who are full of matter on
special topics are continually detecting miserably thin places in the
web of that information which he will not desist from imparting.Nobody
that I know of ever proposed a testimonial to a man for thus
volunteering the whole expense of the conversation.Why is there a different standard of judgment with regard to a writer
who plays much the same part in literature as the excessive talker plays
in what is traditionally called conversation?The busy Adrastus, whose
professional engagements might seem more than enough for the nervous
energy of one man, and who yet finds time to print essays on the chief
current subjects, from the tri-lingual inscriptions, or the Idea of the
Infinite among the prehistoric Lapps, to the Colorado beetle and the
grape disease in the south of France, is generally praised if not
admired for the breadth of his mental range and his gigantic powers of
work.Poor Theron, who has some original ideas on a subject to which he
has given years of research and meditation, has been waiting anxiously
from month to month to see whether his condensed exposition will find a
place in the next advertised programme, but sees it, on the contrary,
regularly excluded, and twice the space he asked for filled with the
copious brew of Adrastus, whose name carries custom like a celebrated
trade-mark.Why should the eager haste to tell what he thinks on the
shortest notice, as if his opinion were a needed preliminary to
discussion, get a man the reputation of being a conceited bore in
conversation, when nobody blames the same tendency if it shows itself in
print?The excessive talker can only be in one gathering at a time, and
there is the comfort of thinking that everywhere else other
fellow-citizens who have something to say may get a chance of delivering
themselves; but the exorbitant writer can occupy space and spread over
it the more or less agreeable flavour of his mind in four "mediums" at
once, and on subjects taken from the four winds.Such restless and
versatile occupants of literary space and time should have lived earlier
when the world wanted summaries of all extant knowledge, and this
knowledge being small, there was the more room for commentary and
conjecture.They might have played the part of an Isidor of Seville or a
Vincent of Beauvais brilliantly, and the willingness to write everything
themselves would have been strictly in place.In the present day, the
busy retailer of other people's knowledge which he has spoiled in the
handling, the restless guesser and commentator, the importunate hawker
of undesirable superfluities, the everlasting word-compeller who rises
early in the morning to praise what the world has already glorified, or
makes himself haggard at night in writing out his dissent from what
nobody ever believed, is not simply "gratis anhelans, multa agendo nihil
agens"--he is an obstruction.Like an incompetent architect with too
much interest at his back, he obtrudes his ill-considered work where
place ought to have been left to better men.Is it out of the question that we should entertain some scruple about
mixing our own flavour, as of the too cheap and insistent nutmeg, with
that of every great writer and every great subject?--especially when our
flavour is all we have to give, the matter or knowledge having been
already given by somebody else.What if we were only like the Spanish
wine-skins which impress the innocent stranger with the notion that the
Spanish grape has naturally a taste of leather?One could wish that even
the greatest minds should leave some themes unhandled, or at least leave
us no more than a paragraph or two on them to show how well they did in
not being more lengthy.Such entertainment of scruple can hardly be expected from the young; but
happily their readiness to mirror the universe anew for the rest of
mankind is not encouraged by easy publicity.In the vivacious Pepin I
have often seen the image of my early youth, when it seemed to me
astonishing that the philosophers had left so many difficulties
unsolved, and that so many great themes had raised no great poet to
treat them.I had an elated sense that I should find my brain full of
theoretic clues when I looked for them, and that wherever a poet had not
done what I expected, it was for want of my insight.Not knowing what
had been said about the play of Romeo and Juliet, I felt myself capable
of writing something original on its blemishes and beauties.In relation
to all subjects I had a joyous consciousness of that ability which is
prior to knowledge, and of only needing to apply myself in order to
master any task--to conciliate philosophers whose systems were at
present but dimly known to me, to estimate foreign poets whom I had not
yet read, to show up mistakes in an historical monograph that roused my
interest in an epoch which I had been hitherto ignorant of, when I
should once have had time to verify my views of probability by looking
into an encyclopaedia.So Pepin; save only that he is industrious while
I was idle.Like the astronomer in Rasselas, I swayed the universe in my
consciousness without making any difference outside me; whereas Pepin,
while feeling himself powerful with the stars in their courses, really
raises some dust here below.He is no longer in his spring-tide, but
having been always busy he has been obliged to use his first impressions
as if they were deliberate opinions, and to range himself on the
corresponding side in ignorance of much that he commits himself to; so
that he retains some characteristics of a comparatively tender age, and
among them a certain surprise that there have not been more persons
equal to himself.Perhaps it is unfortunate for him that he early gained
a hearing, or at least a place in print, and was thus encouraged in
acquiring a fixed habit of writing, to the exclusion of any other
bread-winning pursuit.He is already to be classed as a "general
writer," corresponding to the comprehensive wants of the "general
reader," and with this industry on his hands it is not enough for him to
keep up the ingenuous self-reliance of youth: he finds himself under an
obligation to be skilled in various methods of seeming to know; and
having habitually expressed himself before he was convinced, his
interest in all subjects is chiefly to ascertain that he has not made a
mistake, and to feel his infallibility confirmed.That impulse to
decide, that vague sense of being able to achieve the unattempted, that
dream of aerial unlimited movement at will without feet or wings, which
were once but the joyous mounting of young sap, are already taking shape
as unalterable woody fibre: the impulse has hardened into "style," and
into a pattern of peremptory sentences; the sense of ability in the
presence of other men's failures is turning into the official arrogance
of one who habitually issues directions which he has never himself been
called on to execute; the dreamy buoyancy of the stripling has taken on
a fatal sort of reality in written pretensions which carry consequences.He is on the way to become like the loud-buzzing, bouncing Bombus who
combines conceited illusions enough to supply several patients in a
lunatic asylum with the freedom to show himself at large in various
forms of print.If one who takes himself for the telegraphic centre of
all American wires is to be confined as unfit to transact affairs, what
shall we say to the man who believes himself in possession of the
unexpressed motives and designs dwelling in the breasts of all
sovereigns and all politicians?And I grieve to think that poor Pepin,
though less political, may by-and-by manifest a persuasion hardly more
sane, for he is beginning to explain people's writing by what he does
not know about them.Yet he was once at the comparatively innocent stage
which I have confessed to be that of my own early astonishment at my
powerful originality; and copying the just humility of the old Puritan,
I may say, "But for the grace of discouragement, this coxcombry might
have been mine."Pepin made for himself a necessity of writing (and getting printed)
before he had considered whether he had the knowledge or belief that
would furnish eligible matter.At first perhaps the necessity galled him
a little, but it is now as easily borne, nay, is as irrepressible a
habit as the outpouring of inconsiderate talk.He is gradually being
condemned to have no genuine impressions, no direct consciousness of
enjoyment or the reverse from the quality of what is before him: his
perceptions are continually arranging themselves in forms suitable to a
printed judgment, and hence they will often turn out to be as much to
the purpose if they are written without any direct contemplation of the
object, and are guided by a few external conditions which serve to
classify it for him.In this way he is irrevocably losing the faculty of
accurate mental vision: having bound himself to express judgments which
will satisfy some other demands than that of veracity, he has blunted
his perceptions by continual preoccupation.We cannot command veracity
at will: the power of seeing and reporting truly is a form of health
that has to be delicately guarded, and as an ancient Rabbi has solemnly
said, "The penalty of untruth is untruth."But Pepin is only a mild
example of the fact that incessant writing with a view to printing
carries internal consequences which have often the nature of disease.And however unpractical it may be held to consider whether we have
anything to print which it is good for the world to read, or which has
not been better said before, it will perhaps be allowed to be worth
considering what effect the printing may have on ourselves.Clearly
there is a sort of writing which helps to keep the writer in a
ridiculously contented ignorance; raising in him continually the sense
of having delivered himself effectively, so that the acquirement of more
thorough knowledge seems as superfluous as the purchase of costume for a
past occasion.He has invested his vanity (perhaps his hope of income)
in his own shallownesses and mistakes, and must desire their prosperity.Like the professional prophet, he learns to be glad of the harm that
keeps up his credit, and to be sorry for the good that contradicts him.It is hard enough for any of us, amid the changing winds of fortune and
the hurly-burly of events, to keep quite clear of a gladness which is
another's calamity; but one may choose not to enter on a course which
will turn such gladness into a fixed habit of mind, committing ourselves
to be continually pleased that others should appear to be wrong in order
that we may have the air of being right.In some cases, perhaps, it might be urged that Pepin has remained the
more self-contented because he has _not_ written everything he believed
himself capable of.He once asked me to read a sort of programme of the
species of romance which he should think it worth while to write--a
species which he contrasted in strong terms with the productions of
illustrious but overrated authors in this branch.Pepin's romance was to
present the splendours of the Roman Empire at the culmination of its
grandeur, when decadence was spiritually but not visibly imminent: it
was to show the workings of human passion in the most pregnant and
exalted of human circumstances, the designs of statesmen, the
interfusion of philosophies, the rural relaxation and converse of
immortal poets, the majestic triumphs of warriors, the mingling of the
quaint and sublime in religious ceremony, the gorgeous delirium of
gladiatorial shows, and under all the secretly working leaven of
Christianity.Such a romance would not call the attention of society to
the dialect of stable-boys, the low habits of rustics, the vulgarity of
small schoolmasters, the manners of men in livery, or to any other form
of uneducated talk and sentiments: its characters would have virtues and
vices alike on the grand scale, and would express themselves in an
English representing the discourse of the most powerful minds in the
best Latin, or possibly Greek, when there occurred a scene with a Greek
philosopher on a visit to Rome or resident there as a teacher.In this
way Pepin would do in fiction what had never been done before: something
not at all like 'Rienzi' or 'Notre Dame de Paris,' or any other attempt
of that kind; but something at once more penetrating and more
magnificent, more passionate and more philosophical, more panoramic yet
more select: something that would present a conception of a gigantic
period; in short something truly Roman and world-historical.When Pepin gave me this programme to read he was much younger than at
present.Some slight success in another vein diverted him from the
production of panoramic and select romance, and the experience of not
having tried to carry out his programme has naturally made him more
biting and sarcastic on the failures of those who have actually written
romances without apparently having had a glimpse of a conception equal
to his.Indeed, I am often comparing his rather touchingly inflated
_naivete_ as of a small young person walking on tiptoe while he is
talking of elevated things, at the time when he felt himself the author
of that unwritten romance, with his present epigrammatic curtness and
affectation of power kept strictly in reserve.His paragraphs now seem
to have a bitter smile in them, from the consciousness of a mind too
penetrating to accept any other man's ideas, and too equally competent
in all directions to seclude his power in any one form of creation, but
rather fitted to hang over them all as a lamp of guidance to the
stumblers below.You perceive how proud he is of not being indebted to
any writer: even with the dead he is on the creditor's side, for he is
doing them the service of letting the world know what they meant better
than those poor pre-Pepinians themselves had any means of doing, and he
treats the mighty shades very cavalierly.Is this fellow--citizen of ours, considered simply in the light of a
baptised Christian and tax-paying Englishman, really as madly
conceited, as empty of reverential feeling, as unveracious and careless
of justice, as full of catch-penny devices and stagey attitudinising as
on examination his writing shows itself to be?He has
arrived at his present pass in "the literary calling" through the
self-imposed obligation to give himself a manner which would convey the
impression of superior knowledge and ability.He is much worthier and
more admirable than his written productions, because the moral aspects
exhibited in his writing are felt to be ridiculous or disgraceful in the
personal relations of life.In blaming Pepin's writing we are accusing
the public conscience, which is so lax and ill informed on the momentous
bearings of authorship that it sanctions the total absence of scruple in
undertaking and prosecuting what should be the best warranted of
vocations.Hence I still accept friendly relations with Pepin, for he has much
private amiability, and though he probably thinks of me as a man of
slender talents, without rapidity of _coup d'oeil_ and with no
compensatory penetration, he meets me very cordially, and would not, I
am sure, willingly pain me in conversation by crudely declaring his low
estimate of my capacity.Yet I have often known him to insult my betters
and contribute (perhaps unreflectingly) to encourage injurious
conceptions of them--but that was done in the course of his professional
writing, and the public conscience still leaves such writing nearly on
the level of the Merry-Andrew's dress, which permits an impudent
deportment and extraordinary gambols to one who in his ordinary clothing
shows himself the decent father of a family.DISEASES OF SMALL AUTHORSHIP

Particular callings, it is known, encourage particular diseases.There
is a painter's colic: the Sheffield grinder falls a victim to the
inhalation of steel dust: clergymen so often have a certain kind of sore
throat that this otherwise secular ailment gets named after them.And
perhaps, if we were to inquire, we should find a similar relation
between certain moral ailments and these various occupations, though
here in the case of clergymen there would be specific differences: the
poor curate, equally with the rector, is liable to clergyman's sore
throat, but he would probably be found free from the chronic moral
ailments encouraged by the possession of glebe and those higher chances
of preferment which follow on having a good position already.On the
other hand, the poor curate might have severe attacks of calculating
expectancy concerning parishioners' turkeys, cheeses, and fat geese, or
of uneasy rivalry for the donations of clerical charities.Authors are so miscellaneous a class that
their personified diseases, physical and moral,
might include the whole procession of human
disorders, led by dyspepsia and ending in
madness--the awful Dumb Show of a world-historic
tragedy.Take a large enough area
of human life and all comedy melts into
tragedy, like the Fool's part by the side of
Lear.The chief scenes get filled with erring
heroes, guileful usurpers, persecuted discoverers,
dying deliverers: everywhere the
protagonist has a part pregnant with doom.The comedy sinks to an accessory, and if there
are loud laughs they seem a convulsive transition
from sobs; or if the comedy is touched
with a gentle lovingness, the panoramic scene
is one where

        "Sadness is a kind of mirth
  So mingled as if mirth did make us sad
  And sadness merry."[1]

[Footnote 1: Two Noble Kinsmen.]But I did not set out on the wide survey that would carry me into
tragedy, and in fact had nothing more serious in my mind than certain
small chronic ailments that come of small authorship.I was thinking
principally of Vorticella, who flourished in my youth not only as a
portly lady walking in silk attire, but also as the authoress of a book
entitled 'The Channel Islands, with Notes and an Appendix.'I would by
no means make it a reproach to her that she wrote no more than one book;
on the contrary, her stopping there seems to me a laudable example.What
one would have wished, after experience, was that she had refrained from
producing even that single volume, and thus from giving her
self-importance a troublesome kind of double incorporation which became
oppressive to her acquaintances, and set up in herself one of those
slight chronic forms of disease to which I have just referred.She lived
in the considerable provincial town of Pumpiter, which had its own
newspaper press, with the usual divisions of political partisanship and
the usual varieties of literary criticism--the florid and allusive, the
_staccato_ and peremptory, the clairvoyant and prophetic, the safe and
pattern-phrased, or what one might call "the many-a-long-day style."Vorticella being the wife of an important townsman had naturally the
satisfaction of seeing 'The Channel Islands' reviewed by all the organs
of Pumpiter opinion, and their articles or paragraphs held as naturally
the opening pages in the elegantly bound album prepared by her for the
reception of "critical opinions."This ornamental volume lay on a
special table in her drawing-room close to the still more gorgeously
bound work of which it was the significant effect, and every guest was
allowed the privilege of reading what had been said of the authoress and
her work in the 'Pumpiter Gazette and Literary Watchman,' the 'Pumpshire
Post,' the 'Church Clock,' the 'Independent Monitor,' and the lively but
judicious publication known as the 'Medley Pie;' to be followed up, if
he chose, by the instructive perusal of the strikingly confirmatory
judgments, sometimes concurrent in the very phrases, of journals from
the most distant counties; as the 'Latchgate Argus,' the Penllwy
Universe,' the 'Cockaleekie Advertiser,' the 'Goodwin Sands Opinion,'
and the 'Land's End Times.'I had friends in Pumpiter and occasionally paid a long visit there.When
I called on Vorticella, who had a cousinship with my hosts, she had to
excuse herself because a message claimed her attention for eight or ten
minutes, and handing me the album of critical opinions said, with a
certain emphasis which, considering my youth, was highly complimentary,
that she would really like me to read what I should find there.This
seemed a permissive politeness which I could not feel to be an
oppression, and I ran my eyes over the dozen pages, each with a strip or
islet of newspaper in the centre, with that freedom of mind (in my case
meaning freedom to forget) which would be a perilous way of preparing
for examination.This _ad libitum_ perusal had its interest for me.The
private truth being that I had not read 'The Channel Islands,' I was
amazed at the variety of matter which the volume must contain to have
impressed these different judges with the writer's surpassing capacity
to handle almost all branches of inquiry and all forms of presentation.In Jersey she had shown herself an historian, in Guernsey a poetess, in
Alderney a political economist, and in Sark a humorist: there were
sketches of character scattered through the pages which might put our
"fictionists" to the blush; the style was eloquent and racy, studded
with gems of felicitous remark; and the moral spirit throughout was so
superior that, said one, "the recording angel" (who is not supposed to
take account of literature as such) "would assuredly set down the work
as a deed of religion."The force of this eulogy on the part of several
reviewers was much heightened by the incidental evidence of their
fastidious and severe taste, which seemed to suffer considerably from
the imperfections of our chief writers, even the dead and canonised: one
afflicted them with the smell of oil, another lacked erudition and
attempted (though vainly) to dazzle them with trivial conceits, one
wanted to be more philosophical than nature had made him, another in
attempting to be comic produced the melancholy effect of a half-starved
Merry-Andrew; while one and all, from the author of the 'Areopagitica'
downwards, had faults of style which must have made an able hand in the
'Latchgate Argus' shake the many-glanced head belonging thereto with a
smile of compassionate disapproval.Not so the authoress of 'The Channel
Islands:' Vorticella and Shakspere were allowed to be faultless.I
gathered that no blemishes were observable in the work of this
accomplished writer, and the repeated information that she was "second
to none" seemed after this superfluous.Her thick octavo--notes,
appendix and all--was unflagging from beginning to end; and the 'Land's
End Times,' using a rather dangerous rhetorical figure, recommended you
not to take up the volume unless you had leisure to finish it at a
sitting.It had given one writer more pleasure than he had had for many
a long day--a sentence which had a melancholy resonance, suggesting a
life of studious languor such as all previous achievements of the human
mind failed to stimulate into enjoyment.I think the collection of
critical opinions wound up with this sentence, and I had turned back to
look at the lithographed sketch of the authoress which fronted the first
page of the album, when the fair original re-entered and I laid down the
volume on its appropriate table."Well, what do you think of them?"said Vorticella, with an emphasis
which had some significance unperceived by me."I know you are a great
student.Give me _your_ opinion of these opinions.""They must be very gratifying to you," I answered with a little
confusion, for I perceived that I might easily mistake my footing, and I
began to have a presentiment of an examination for which I was by no
means crammed."On the whole--yes," said Vorticella, in a tone of concession."A few of
the notices are written with some pains, but not one of them has really
grappled with the chief idea in the appendix.I don't know whether you
have studied political economy, but you saw what I said on page 398
about the Jersey fisheries?"I bowed--I confess it--with the mean hope that this movement in the nape
of my neck would be taken as sufficient proof that I had read, marked,
and learned.I do not forgive myself for this pantomimic falsehood, but
I was young and morally timorous, and Vorticella's personality had an
effect on me something like that of a powerful mesmeriser when he
directs all his ten fingers towards your eyes, as unpleasantly visible
ducts for the invisible stream.I felt a great power of contempt in her,
if I did not come up to her expectations."Well," she resumed, "you observe that not one of them has taken up that
argument.But I hope I convinced you about the drag-nets?"Orientally speaking, I had lifted up my foot
on the steep descent of falsity and was compelled to set it down on a
lower level."I should think you must be right," said I, inwardly
resolving that on the next topic I would tell the truth."I _know_ that I am right," said Vorticella."The fact is that no critic
in this town is fit to meddle with such subjects, unless it be Volvox,
and he, with all his command of language, is very superficial.It is
Volvox who writes in the 'Monitor,' I hope you noticed how he
contradicts himself?"My resolution, helped by the equivalence of dangers, stoutly prevailed,
and I said, "No."He is the only one who finds fault with me.He is
a Dissenter, you know.The 'Monitor' is the Dissenters' organ, but my
husband has been so useful to them in municipal affairs that they would
not venture to run my book down; they feel obliged to tell the truth
about me.After praising me for my
penetration and accuracy, he presently says I have allowed myself to be
imposed upon and have let my active imagination run away with me.That
is like his dissenting impertinence.Active my imagination may be, but I
have it under control.Little Vibrio, who writes the playful notice in
the 'Medley Pie,' has a clever hit at Volvox in that passage about the
steeplechase of imagination, where the loser wants to make it appear
that the winner was only run away with.But if you did not notice
Volvox's self-contradiction you would not see the point," added
Vorticella, with rather a chilling intonation."Or perhaps you did not
read the 'Medley Pie' notice?Vibrio is a poor little tippling creature, but, as Mr Carlyle would say,
he has an eye, and he is always lively."I did take up the book again, and read as demanded."It is very ingenious," said I, really appreciating the difficulty of
being lively in this connection: it seemed even more wonderful than that
a Vibrio should have an eye."You are probably surprised to see no notices from the London press,"
said Vorticella."I have one--a very remarkable one.But I reserve it
until the others have spoken, and then I shall introduce it to wind up.I shall have them reprinted, of course, and inserted in future copies.This from the 'Candelabrum' is only eight lines in length, but full of
venom.I think that will tell its
own tale, placed after the other critiques.""People's impressions are so different," said I."Some persons find 'Don
Quixote' dull.""Yes," said Vorticella, in emphatic chest tones, "dulness is a matter of
opinion; but pompous!Perhaps he
means that my matter is too important for his taste; and I have no
objection to _that_.I should just like
to read you that passage about the drag-nets, because I could make it
clearer to you."A second (less ornamental) copy was at her elbow and was already opened,
when to my great relief another guest was announced, and I was able to
take my leave without seeming to run away from 'The Channel Islands,'
though not without being compelled to carry with me the loan of "the
marked copy," which I was to find advantageous in a re-perusal of the
appendix, and was only requested to return before my departure from
Pumpiter.Looking into the volume now with some curiosity, I found it a
very ordinary combination of the commonplace and ambitious, one of those
books which one might imagine to have been written under the old Grub
Street coercion of hunger and thirst, if they were not known beforehand
to be the gratuitous productions of ladies and gentlemen whose
circumstances might be called altogether easy, but for an uneasy vanity
that happened to have been directed towards authorship.Its importance
was that of a polypus, tumour, fungus, or other erratic outgrowth,
noxious and disfiguring in its effect on the individual organism which
nourishes it.Poor Vorticella might not have been more wearisome on a
visit than the majority of her neighbours, but for this disease of
magnified self-importance belonging to small authorship.I understand
that the chronic complaint of 'The Channel Islands' never left her.As
the years went on and the publication tended to vanish in the distance
for her neighbours' memory, she was still bent on dragging it to the
foreground, and her chief interest in new acquaintances was the
possibility of lending them her book, entering into all details
concerning it, and requesting them to read her album of "critical
opinions."This really made her more tiresome than Gregarina, whose
distinction was that she had had cholera, and who did not feel herself
in her true position with strangers until they knew it.My experience with Vorticella led me for a time into the false
supposition that this sort of fungous disfiguration, which makes Self
disagreeably larger, was most common to the female sex; but I presently
found that here too the male could assert his superiority and show a
more vigorous boredom.I have known a man with a single pamphlet
containing an assurance that somebody else was wrong, together with a
few approved quotations, produce a more powerful effect of shuddering at
his approach than ever Vorticella did with her varied octavo volume,
including notes and appendix.Males of more than one nation recur to my
memory who produced from their pocket on the slightest encouragement a
small pink or buff duodecimo pamphlet, wrapped in silver paper, as a
present held ready for an intelligent reader."A mode of propagandism,"
you remark in excuse; "they wished to spread some useful corrective
doctrine."Not necessarily: the indoctrination aimed at was perhaps to
convince you of their own talents by the sample of an "Ode on
Shakspere's Birthday," or a translation from Horace.Vorticella may pair off with Monas, who had also written his one
book--'Here and There; or, a Trip from Truro to Transylvania'--and not
only carried it in his portmanteau when he went on visits, but took the
earliest opportunity of depositing it in the drawing-room, and
afterwards would enter to look for it, as if under pressure of a need
for reference, begging the lady of the house to tell him whether she,
had seen "a small volume bound in red."One hostess at last ordered it
to be carried into his bedroom to save his time; but it presently
reappeared in his hands, and was again left with inserted slips of paper
on the drawing-room table.Depend upon it, vanity is human, native alike to men and women; only in
the male it is of denser texture, less volatile, so that it less
immediately informs you of its presence, but is more massive and capable
of knocking you down if you come into collision with it; while in women
vanity lays by its small revenges as in a needle-case always at hand.The difference is in muscle and finger-tips, in traditional habits and
mental perspective, rather than in the original appetite of vanity.It
is an approved method now to explain ourselves by a reference to the
races as little like us as possible, which leads me to observe that in
Fiji the men use the most elaborate hair-dressing, and that wherever
tattooing is in vogue the male expects to carry off the prize of
admiration for pattern and workmanship.Arguing analogically, and
looking for this tendency of the Fijian or Hawaian male in the eminent
European, we must suppose that it exhibits itself under the forms of
civilised apparel; and it would be a great mistake to estimate
passionate effort by the effect it produces on our perception or
understanding.It is conceivable that a man may have concentrated no
less will and expectation on his wristbands, gaiters, and the shape of
his hat-brim, or an appearance which impresses you as that of the modern
"swell," than the Ojibbeway on an ornamentation which seems to us much
more elaborate.In what concerns the search for admiration at least, it
is not true that the effect is equal to the cause and resembles it.The
cause of a flat curl on the masculine forehead, such as might be seen
when George the Fourth was king, must have been widely different in
quality and intensity from the impression made by that small scroll of
hair on the organ of the beholder.Merely to maintain an attitude and
gait which I notice in certain club men, and especially an inflation of
the chest accompanying very small remarks, there goes, I am convinced,
an expenditure of psychical energy little appreciated by the
multitude--a mental vision of Self and deeply impressed beholders which
is quite without antitype in what we call the effect produced by that
hidden process.there is no need to admit that women would carry away the prize of
vanity in a competition where differences of custom were fairly
considered.A man cannot show his vanity in a tight skirt which forces
him to walk sideways down the staircase; but let the match be between
the respective vanities of largest beard and tightest skirt, and here
too the battle would be to the strong.It is a familiar example of irony in the degradation of words that "what
a man is worth" has come to mean how much money he possesses; but there
seems a deeper and more melancholy irony in the shrunken meaning that
popular or polite speech assigns to "morality" and "morals."The poor
part these words are made to play recalls the fate of those pagan
divinities who, after being understood to rule the powers of the air and
the destinies of men, came down to the level of insignificant demons, or
were even made a farcical show for the amusement of the multitude.Talking to Melissa in a time of commercial trouble, I found her disposed
to speak pathetically of the disgrace which had fallen on Sir Gavial
Mantrap, because of his conduct in relation to the Eocene Mines, and to
other companies ingeniously devised by him for the punishment of
ignorance in people of small means: a disgrace by which the poor titled
gentleman was actually reduced to live in comparative obscurity on his
wife's settlement of one or two hundred thousand in the consols."Surely your pity is misapplied," said I, rather dubiously, for I like
the comfort of trusting that a correct moral judgment is the strong
point in woman (seeing that she has a majority of about a million in our
islands), and I imagined that Melissa might have some unexpressed
grounds for her opinion."I should have thought you would rather be
sorry for Mantrap's victims--the widows, spinsters, and hard-working
fathers whom his unscrupulous haste to make himself rich has cheated of
all their savings, while he is eating well, lying softly, and after
impudently justifying himself before the public, is perhaps joining in
the General Confession with a sense that he is an acceptable object in
the sight of God, though decent men refuse to meet him.""Oh, all that about the Companies, I know, was most unfortunate.In
commerce people are led to do so many things, and he might not know
exactly how everything would turn out.But Sir Gavial made a good use of
his money, and he is a thoroughly _moral_ man.""What do you mean by a thoroughly moral man?""Oh, I suppose every one means the same by that," said Melissa, with a
slight air of rebuke."Sir Gavial is an excellent family man--quite
blameless there; and so charitable round his place at Tiptop.Very
different from Mr Barabbas, whose life, my husband tells me, is most
objectionable, with actresses and that sort of thing.I think a man's
morals should make a difference to us.I'm not sorry for Mr Barabbas,
but _I am_ sorry for Sir Gavial Mantrap."I will not repeat my answer to Melissa, for I fear it was offensively
brusque, my opinion being that Sir Gavial was the more pernicious
scoundrel of the two, since his name for virtue served as an effective
part of a swindling apparatus; and perhaps I hinted that to call such a
man moral showed rather a silly notion of human affairs.In fact, I had
an angry wish to be instructive, and Melissa, as will sometimes happen,
noticed my anger without appropriating my instruction, for I have since
heard that she speaks of me as rather violent-tempered, and not over
strict in my views of morality.I wish that this narrow use of words which are wanted in their full
meaning were confined to women like Melissa.Seeing that Morality and
Morals under their _alias_ of Ethics are the subject of voluminous
discussion, and their true basis a pressing matter of dispute--seeing
that the most famous book ever written on Ethics, and forming a chief
study in our colleges, allies ethical with political science or that
which treats of the constitution and prosperity of States, one might
expect that educated men would find reason to avoid a perversion of
language which lends itself to no wider view of life than that of
village gossips.Yet I find even respectable historians of our own and
of foreign countries, after showing that a king was treacherous,
rapacious, and ready to sanction gross breaches in the administration of
justice, end by praising him for his pure moral character, by which one
must suppose them to mean that he was not lewd nor debauched, not the
European twin of the typical Indian potentate whom Macaulay describes as
passing his life in chewing bang and fondling dancing-girls.And since
we are sometimes told of such maleficent kings that they were religious,
we arrive at the curious result that the most serious wide-reaching
duties of man lie quite outside both Morality and Religion--the one of
these consisting in not keeping mistresses (and perhaps not drinking too
much), and the other in certain ritual and spiritual transactions with
God which can be carried on equally well side by side with the basest
conduct towards men.With such a classification as this it is no wonder,
considering the strong reaction of language on thought, that many minds,
dizzy with indigestion of recent science and philosophy, are far to seek
for the grounds of social duty, and without entertaining any private
intention of committing a perjury which would ruin an innocent man, or
seeking gain by supplying bad preserved meats to our navy, feel
themselves speculatively obliged to inquire why they should not do so,
and are inclined to measure their intellectual subtlety by their
dissatisfaction with all answers to this "Why?"It is of little use to
theorise in ethics while our habitual phraseology stamps the larger part
of our social duties as something that lies aloof from the deepest needs
and affections of our nature.The informal definitions of popular
language are the only medium through which theory really affects the
mass of minds even among the nominally educated; and when a man whose
business hours, the solid part of every day, are spent in an
unscrupulous course of public or private action which has every
calculable chance of causing widespread injury and misery, can be called
moral because he comes home to dine with his wife and children and
cherishes the happiness of his own hearth, the augury is not good for
the use of high ethical and theological disputation.Not for one moment would one willingly lose sight of the truth that the
relation of the sexes and the primary ties of kinship are the deepest
roots of human wellbeing, but to make them by themselves the equivalent
of morality is verbally to cut off the channels of feeling through
which they are the feeders of that wellbeing.They are the original
fountains of a sensibility to the claims of others, which is the bond of
societies; but being necessarily in the first instance a private good,
there is always the danger that individual selfishness will see in them
only the best part of its own gain; just as knowledge, navigation,
commerce, and all the conditions which are of a nature to awaken men's
consciousness of their mutual dependence and to make the world one great
society, are the occasions of selfish, unfair action, of war and
oppression, so long as the public conscience or chief force of feeling
and opinion is not uniform and strong enough in its insistance on what
is demanded by the general welfare.And among the influences that must
<DW44> a right public judgment, the degradation of words which involve
praise and blame will be reckoned worth protesting against by every
mature observer.To rob words of half their meaning, while they retain
their dignity as qualifications, is like allowing to men who have lost
half their faculties the same high and perilous command which they won
in their time of vigour; or like selling food and seeds after
fraudulently abstracting their best virtues: in each case what ought to
be beneficently strong is fatally enfeebled, if not empoisoned.Until we
have altered our dictionaries and have found some other word than
_morality_ to stand in popular use for the duties of man to man, let us
refuse to accept as moral the contractor who enriches himself by using
large machinery to make pasteboard soles pass as leather for the feet of
unhappy conscripts fighting at miserable odds against invaders: let us
rather call him a miscreant, though he were the tenderest, most faithful
of husbands, and contend that his own experience of home happiness makes
his reckless infliction of suffering on others all the more atrocious.Let us refuse to accept as moral any political leader who should allow
his conduct in relation to great issues to be determined by egoistic
passion, and boldly say that he would be less immoral even though he
were as lax in his personal habits as Sir Robert Walpole, if at the same
time his sense of the public welfare were supreme in his mind, quelling
all pettier impulses beneath a magnanimous impartiality.And though we
were to find among that class of journalists who live by recklessly
reporting injurious rumours, insinuating the blackest motives in
opponents, descanting at large and with an air of infallibility on
dreams which they both find and interpret, and stimulating bad feeling
between nations by abusive writing which is as empty of real conviction
as the rage of a pantomime king, and would be ludicrous if its effects
did not make it appear diabolical--though we were to find among these a
man who was benignancy itself in his own circle, a healer of private
differences, a soother in private calamities, let us pronounce him
nevertheless flagrantly immoral, a root of hideous cancer in the
commonwealth, turning the channels of instruction into feeders of social
and political disease.In opposite ways one sees bad effects likely to be encouraged by this
narrow use of the word _morals_, shutting out from its meaning half
those actions of a man's life which tell momentously on the wellbeing of
his fellow-citizens, and on the preparation of a future for the children
growing up around him.Thoroughness of workmanship, care in the
execution of every task undertaken, as if it were the acceptance of a
trust which it would be a breach of faith not to discharge well, is a
form of duty so momentous that if it were to die out from the feeling
and practice of a people, all reforms of institutions would be helpless
to create national prosperity and national happiness.Do we desire to
see public spirit penetrating all classes of the community and affecting
every man's conduct, so that he shall make neither the saving of his
soul nor any other private saving an excuse for indifference to the
general welfare?But the sort of public spirit that
scamps its bread-winning work, whether with the trowel, the pen, or the
overseeing brain, that it may hurry to scenes of political or social
agitation, would be as baleful a gift to our people as any malignant
demon could devise.One best part of educational training is that which
comes through special knowledge and manipulative or other skill, with
its usual accompaniment of delight, in relation to work which is the
daily bread-winning occupation--which is a man's contribution to the
effective wealth of society in return for what he takes as his own
share.But this duty of doing one's proper work well, and taking care
that every product of one's labour shall be genuinely what it pretends
to be, is not only left out of morals in popular speech, it is very
little insisted on by public teachers, at least in the only effective
way--by tracing the continuous effects of ill-done work.Some of them
seem to be still hopeful that it will follow as a necessary consequence
from week-day services, ecclesiastical decoration, and improved
hymn-books; others apparently trust to descanting on self-culture in
general, or to raising a general sense of faulty circumstances; and
meanwhile lax, make-shift work, from the high conspicuous kind to the
average and obscure, is allowed to pass unstamped with the disgrace of
immorality, though there is not a member of society who is not daily
suffering from it materially and spiritually, and though it is the fatal
cause that must degrade our national rank and our commerce in spite of
all open markets and discovery of available coal-seams.I suppose one may take the popular misuse of the words Morality and
Morals as some excuse for certain absurdities which are occasional
fashions in speech and writing--certain old lay-figures, as ugly as the
queerest Asiatic idol, which at different periods get propped into
loftiness, and attired in magnificent Venetian drapery, so that whether
they have a human face or not is of little consequence.One is, the
notion that there is a radical, irreconcilable opposition between
intellect and morality.I do not mean the simple statement of fact,
which everybody knows, that remarkably able men have had very faulty
morals, and have outraged public feeling even at its ordinary standard;
but the supposition that the ablest intellect, the highest genius, will
see through morality as a sort of twaddle for bibs and tuckers, a
doctrine of dulness, a mere incident in human stupidity.We begin to
understand the acceptance of this foolishness by considering that we
live in a society where we may hear a treacherous monarch, or a
malignant and lying politician, or a man who uses either official or
literary power as an instrument of his private partiality or hatred, or
a manufacturer who devises the falsification of wares, or a trader who
deals in virtueless seed-grains, praised or compassionated because of
his excellent morals.Clearly if morality meant no more than such decencies as are practised
by these poisonous members of society, it would be possible to say,
without suspicion of light-headedness, that morality lay aloof from the
grand stream of human affairs, as a small channel fed by the stream and
not missed from it.While this form of nonsense is conveyed in the
popular use of words, there must be plenty of well-dressed ignorance at
leisure to run through a box of books, which will feel itself initiated
in the freemasonry of intellect by a view of life which might take for a
Shaksperian motto--

  "Fair is foul and foul is fair,
  Hover through the fog and filthy air"--

and will find itself easily provided with striking conversation by the
rule of reversing all the judgments on good and evil which have come to
be the calendar and clock-work of society.But let our habitual talk
give morals their full meaning as the conduct which, in every human
relation, would follow from the fullest knowledge and the fullest
sympathy--a meaning perpetually corrected and enriched by a more
thorough appreciation of dependence in things, and a finer sensibility
to both physical and spiritual fact--and this ridiculous ascription of
superlative power to minds which have no effective awe-inspiring vision
of the human lot, no response of understanding to the connection between
duty and the material processes by which the world is kept habitable for
cultivated man, will be tacitly discredited without any need to cite the
immortal names that all are obliged to take as the measure of
intellectual rank and highly-charged genius.Suppose a Frenchman--I mean no disrespect to the great French nation,
for all nations are afflicted with their peculiar parasitic growths,
which are lazy, hungry forms, usually characterised by a
disproportionate swallowing apparatus: suppose a Parisian who should
shuffle down the Boulevard with a soul ignorant of the gravest cares and
the deepest tenderness of manhood, and a frame more or less fevered by
debauchery, mentally polishing into utmost refinement of phrase and
rhythm verses which were an enlargement on that Shaksperian motto, and
worthy of the most expensive title to be furnished by the vendors of
such antithetic ware as _Les_ _marguerites de l'Enfer_, or _Les delices
de Beelzebuth_.This supposed personage might probably enough regard his
negation of those moral sensibilities which make half the warp and woof
of human history, his indifference to the hard thinking and hard
handiwork of life, to which he owed even his own gauzy mental garments
with their spangles of poor paradox, as the royalty of genius, for we
are used to witness such self-crowning in many forms of mental
alienation; but he would not, I think, be taken, even by his own
generation, as a living proof that there can exist such a combination as
that of moral stupidity and trivial emphasis of personal indulgence with
the large yet finely discriminating vision which marks the intellectual
masters of our kind.Doubtless there are many sorts of transfiguration,
and a man who has come to be worthy of all gratitude and reverence may
have had his swinish period, wallowing in ugly places; but suppose it
had been handed down to us that Sophocles or Virgil had at one time made
himself scandalous in this way: the works which have consecrated their
memory for our admiration and gratitude are not a glorifying of
swinishness, but an artistic incorporation of the highest sentiment
known to their age.All these may seem to be wide reasons for objecting to Melissa's pity
for Sir Gavial Mantrap on the ground of his good morals; but their
connection will not be obscure to any one who has taken pains to observe
the links uniting the scattered signs of our social development.SHADOWS OF THE COMING RACE.My friend Trost, who is no optimist as to the state of the universe
hitherto, but is confident that at some future period within the
duration of the solar system, ours will be the best of all possible
worlds--a hope which I always honour as a sign of beneficent
qualities--my friend Trost always tries to keep up my spirits under the
sight of the extremely unpleasant and disfiguring work by which many of
our fellow-creatures have to get their bread, with the assurance that
"all this will soon be done by machinery."But he sometimes neutralises
the consolation by extending it over so large an area of human labour,
and insisting so impressively on the quantity of energy which will thus
be set free for loftier purposes, that I am tempted to desire an
occasional famine of invention in the coming ages, lest the humbler
kinds of work should be entirely nullified while there are still left
some men and women who are not fit for the highest.Especially, when one considers the perfunctory way in which some of the
most exalted tasks are already executed by those who are understood to
be educated for them, there rises a fearful vision of the human race
evolving machinery which will by-and-by throw itself fatally out of
work.When, in the Bank of England, I see a wondrously delicate machine
for testing sovereigns, a shrewd implacable little steel Rhadamanthus
that, once the coins are delivered up to it, lifts and balances each in
turn for the fraction of an instant, finds it wanting or sufficient, and
dismisses it to right or left with rigorous justice; when I am told of
micrometers and thermopiles and tasimeters which deal physically with
the invisible, the impalpable, and the unimaginable; of cunning wires
and wheels and pointing needles which will register your and my
quickness so as to exclude flattering opinion; of a machine for drawing
the right conclusion, which will doubtless by-and-by be improved into
an automaton for finding true premises; of a microphone which detects
the cadence of the fly's foot on the ceiling, and may be expected
presently to discriminate the noises of our various follies as they
soliloquise or converse in our brains--my mind seeming too small for
these things, I get a little out of it, like an unfortunate savage too
suddenly brought face to face with civilisation, and I exclaim--

"Am I already in the shadow of the Coming Race?and will the creatures
who are to transcend and finally supersede us be steely organisms,
giving out the effluvia of the laboratory, and performing with
infallible exactness more than everything that we have performed with a
slovenly approximativeness and self-defeating inaccuracy?""But," says Trost, treating me with cautious mildness on hearing me vent
this raving notion, "you forget that these wonder-workers are the slaves
of our race, need our tendance and regulation, obey the mandates of our
consciousness, and are only deaf and dumb bringers of reports which we
decipher and make use of.They are simply extensions of the human
organism, so to speak, limbs immeasurably more powerful, ever more
subtle finger-tips, ever more mastery over the invisibly great and the
invisibly small.Each new machine needs a new appliance of human skill
to construct it, new devices to feed it with material, and often
keener-edged faculties to note its registrations or performances.How
then can machines supersede us?--they depend upon us."I am not so sure of that," said I, getting back into my mind, and
becoming rather wilful in consequence."If, as I have heard you contend,
machines as they are more and more perfected will require less and less
of tendance, how do I know that they may not be ultimately made to
carry, or may not in themselves evolve, conditions of self-supply,
self-repair, and reproduction, and not only do all the mighty and subtle
work possible on this planet better than we could do it, but with the
immense advantage of banishing from the earth's atmosphere screaming
consciousnesses which, in our comparatively clumsy race, make an
intolerable noise and fuss to each other about every petty ant-like
performance, looking on at all work only as it were to spring a rattle
here or blow a trumpet there, with a ridiculous sense of being
effective?I for my part cannot see any reason why a sufficiently
penetrating thinker, who can see his way through a thousand years or so,
should not conceive a parliament of machines, in which the manners were
excellent and the motions infallible in logic: one honourable
instrument, a remote descendant of the Voltaic family, might discharge a
powerful current (entirely without animosity) on an honourable
instrument opposite, of more upstart origin, but belonging to the
ancient edge-tool race which we already at Sheffield see paring thick
iron as if it were mellow cheese--by this unerringly directed discharge
operating on movements corresponding to what we call Estimates, and by
necessary mechanical consequence on movements corresponding to what we
call the Funds, which with a vain analogy we sometimes speak of as
"sensitive."For every machine would be perfectly educated, that is to
say, would have the suitable molecular adjustments, which would act not
the less infallibly for being free from the fussy accompaniment of that
consciousness to which our prejudice gives a supreme governing rank,
when in truth it is an idle parasite on the grand sequence of things."returned Trost, getting angry, and judging it
kind to treat me with some severity; "what you have heard me say is,
that our race will and must act as a nervous centre to the utmost
development of mechanical processes: the subtly refined powers of
machines will react in producing more subtly refined thinking processes
which will occupy the minds set free from grosser labour.Say, for
example, that all the scavengers work of London were done, so far as
human attention is concerned, by the occasional pressure of a brass
button (as in the ringing of an electric bell), you will then have a
multitude of brains set free for the exquisite enjoyment of dealing with
the exact sequences and high speculations supplied and prompted by the
delicate machines which yield a response to the fixed stars, and give
readings of the spiral vortices fundamentally concerned in the
production of epic poems or great judicial harangues.So far from
mankind being thrown out of work according to your notion," concluded
Trost, with a peculiar nasal note of scorn, "if it were not for your
incurable dilettanteism in science as in all other things--if you had
once understood the action of any delicate machine--you would perceive
that the sequences it carries throughout the realm of phenomena would
require many generations, perhaps aeons, of understandings considerably
stronger than yours, to exhaust the store of work it lays open.""Precisely," said I, with a meekness which I felt was praiseworthy; "it
is the feebleness of my capacity, bringing me nearer than you to the
human average, that perhaps enables me to imagine certain results better
than you can.Doubtless the very fishes of our rivers, gullible as they
look, and slow as they are to be rightly convinced in another order of
facts, form fewer false expectations about each other than we should
form about them if we were in a position of somewhat fuller intercourse
with their species; for even as it is we have continually to be
surprised that they do not rise to our carefully selected bait.Take me
then as a sort of reflective and experienced carp; but do not estimate
the justice of my ideas by my facial expression."says Trost (We are on very intimate terms.)"Naturally," I persisted, "it is less easy to you than to me to imagine
our race transcended and superseded, since the more energy a being is
possessed of, the harder it must be for him to conceive his own death.But I, from the point of view of a reflective carp, can easily imagine
myself and my congeners dispensed with in the frame of things and giving
way not only to a superior but a vastly different kind of Entity.What I
would ask you is, to show me why, since each new invention casts a new
light along the pathway of discovery, and each new combination or
structure brings into play more conditions than its inventor foresaw,
there should not at length be a machine of such high mechanical and
chemical powers that it would find and assimilate the material to supply
its own waste, and then by a further evolution of internal molecular
movements reproduce itself by some process of fission or budding.This
last stage having been reached, either by man's contrivance or as an
unforeseen result, one sees that the process of natural selection must
drive men altogether out of the field; for they will long before have
begun to sink into the miserable condition of those unhappy characters
in fable who, having demons or djinns at their beck, and being obliged
to supply them with work, found too much of everything done in too short
a time.What demons so potent as molecular movements, none the less
tremendously potent for not carrying the futile cargo of a consciousness
screeching irrelevantly, like a fowl tied head downmost to the saddle of
a swift horseman?Under such uncomfortable circumstances our race will
have diminished with the diminishing call on their energies, and by the
time that the self-repairing and reproducing machines arise, all but a
few of the rare inventors, calculators, and speculators will have become
pale, pulpy, and cretinous from fatty or other degeneration, and behold
around them a scanty hydrocephalous offspring.As to the breed of the
ingenious and intellectual, their nervous systems will at last have been
overwrought in following the molecular revelations of the immensely
more powerful unconscious race, and they will naturally, as the less
energetic combinations of movement, subside like the flame of a candle
in the sunlight Thus the feebler race, whose corporeal adjustments
happened to be accompanied with a maniacal consciousness which imagined
itself moving its mover, will have vanished, as all less adapted
existences do before the fittest--i.e., the existence composed of the
most persistent groups of movements and the most capable of
incorporating new groups in harmonious relation.Who--if our
consciousness is, as I have been given to understand, a mere stumbling
of our organisms on their way to unconscious perfection--who shall say
that those fittest existences will not be found along the track of what
we call inorganic combinations, which will carry on the most elaborate
processes as mutely and painlessly as we are now told that the minerals
are metamorphosing themselves continually in the dark laboratory of the
earth's crust?Thus this planet may be filled with beings who will be
blind and deaf as the inmost rock, yet will execute changes as delicate
and complicated as those of human language and all the intricate web of
what we call its effects, without sensitive impression, without
sensitive impulse: there may be, let us say, mute orations, mute
rhapsodies, mute discussions, and no consciousness there even to enjoy
the silence.""The supposition is logical," said I."It is well argued from the
premises."cried Trost, turning on me with some fierceness."You
don't mean to call them mine, I hope."They seem to be flying about in the air with other
germs, and have found a sort of nidus among my melancholy fancies.They bear the same relation to real belief as
walking on the head for a show does to running away from an explosion or
walking fast to catch the train."To discern likeness amidst diversity, it is well known, does not require
so fine a mental edge as the discerning of diversity amidst general
sameness.The primary rough classification depends on the prominent
resemblances of things: the progress is towards finer and finer
discrimination according to minute differences.Yet even at this stage
of European culture one's attention is continually drawn to the
prevalence of that grosser mental sloth which makes people dull to the
most ordinary prompting of comparison--the bringing things together
because of their likeness.The same motives, the same ideas, the same
practices, are alternately admired and abhorred, lauded and denounced,
according to their association with superficial differences, historical
or actually social: even learned writers treating of great subjects
often show an attitude of mind not greatly superior in its logic to that
of the frivolous fine lady who is indignant at the frivolity of her
maid.To take only the subject of the Jews: it would be difficult to find a
form of bad reasoning about them which has not been heard in
conversation or been admitted to the dignity of print; but the neglect
of resemblances is a common property of dulness which unites all the
various points of view--the prejudiced, the puerile, the spiteful, and
the abysmally ignorant.That the preservation of national memories is an element and a means of
national greatness, that their revival is a sign of reviving
nationality, that every heroic defender, every patriotic restorer, has
been inspired by such memories and has made them his watchword, that
even such a corporate existence as that of a Roman legion or an English
regiment has been made valorous by memorial standards,--these are the
glorious commonplaces of historic teaching at our public schools and
universities, being happily ingrained in Greek and Latin classics.They
have also been impressed on the world by conspicuous modern instances.That there is a free modern Greece is due--through all infiltration of
other than Greek blood--to the presence of ancient Greece in the
consciousness of European men; and every speaker would feel his point
safe if he were to praise Byron's devotion to a cause made glorious by
ideal identification with the past; hardly so, if he were to insist that
the Greeks were not to be helped further because their history shows
that they were anciently unsurpassed in treachery and lying, and that
many modern Greeks are highly disreputable characters, while others are
disposed to grasp too large a share of our commerce.The same with
Italy: the pathos of his country's lot pierced the youthful soul of
Mazzini, because, like Dante's, his blood was fraught with the kinship
of Italian greatness, his imagination filled with a majestic past that
wrought itself into a majestic future.Half a century ago, what was
Italy?An idling-place of dilettanteism or of itinerant motiveless
wealth, a territory parcelled out for papal sustenance, dynastic
convenience, and the profit of an alien Government.No people, no voice in European counsels, no massive power in
European affairs: a race thought of in English and French society as
chiefly adapted to the operatic stage, or to serve as models for
painters; disposed to smile gratefully at the reception of halfpence;
and by the more historical remembered to be rather polite than truthful,
in all probability a combination of Machiavelli, Rubini, and Masaniello.Thanks chiefly to the divine gift of a memory which inspires the moments
with a past, a present, and a future, and gives the sense of corporate
existence that raises man above the otherwise more respectable and
innocent brute, all that, or most of it, is changed.Again, one of our living historians finds just sympathy in his vigorous
insistance on our true ancestry, on our being the strongly marked
heritors in language and genius of those old English seamen who,
beholding a rich country with a most convenient seaboard, came,
doubtless with a sense of divine warrant, and settled themselves on this
or the other side of fertilising streams, gradually conquering more and
more of the pleasant land from the natives who knew nothing of Odin,
and finally making unusually clean work in ridding themselves of those
prior occupants."Let us," he virtually says, "let us know who were our
forefathers, who it was that won the soil for us, and brought the good
seed of those institutions through which we should not arrogantly but
gratefully feel ourselves distinguished among the nations as possessors
of long-inherited freedom; let us not keep up an ignorant kind of naming
which disguises our true affinities of blood and language, but let us
see thoroughly what sort of notions and traditions our forefathers had,
and what sort of song inspired them.Let the poetic fragments which
breathe forth their fierce bravery in battle and their trust in fierce
gods who helped them, be treasured with affectionate reverence.These
seafaring, invading, self-asserting men were the English of old time,
and were our fathers who did rough work by which we are profiting.They
had virtues which incorporated themselves in wholesome usages to which
we trace our own political blessings.Let us know and acknowledge our
common relationship to them, and be thankful that over and above the
affections and duties which spring from our manhood, we have the closer
and more constantly guiding duties which belong to us as Englishmen."To this view of our nationality most persons who have feeling and
understanding enough to be conscious of the connection between the
patriotic affection and every other affection which lifts us above
emigrating rats and free-loving baboons, will be disposed to say Amen.True, we are not indebted to those ancestors for our religion: we are
rather proud of having got that illumination from elsewhere.The men who
planted our nation were not Christians, though they began their work
centuries after Christ; and they had a decided objection to Christianity
when it was first proposed to them: they were not monotheists, and their
religion was the reverse of spiritual.But since we have been fortunate
enough to keep the island-home they won for us, and have been on the
whole a prosperous people, rather continuing the plan of invading and
spoiling other lands than being forced to beg for shelter in them,
nobody has reproached us because our fathers thirteen hundred years ago
worshipped Odin, massacred Britons, and were with difficulty persuaded
to accept Christianity, knowing nothing of Hebrew history and the
reasons why Christ should be received as the Saviour of mankind.The Red
Indians, not liking us when we settled among them, might have been
willing to fling such facts in our faces, but they were too ignorant,
and besides, their opinions did not signify, because we were able, if we
liked, to exterminate them.The Hindoos also have doubtless had their
rancours against us and still entertain enough ill-will to make
unfavourable remarks on our character, especially as to our historic
rapacity and arrogant notions of our own superiority; they perhaps do
not admire the usual English profile, and they are not converted to our
way of feeding: but though we are a small number of an alien race
profiting by the territory and produce of these prejudiced people, they
are unable to turn us out; at least, when they tried we showed them
their mistake.We do not call ourselves a dispersed and a punished
people: we are a colonising people, and it is we who have punished
others.Still the historian guides us rightly in urging us to dwell on the
virtues of our ancestors with emulation, and to cherish our sense of a
common descent as a bond of obligation.The eminence, the nobleness of a
people depends on its capability of being stirred by memories, and of
striving for what we call spiritual ends--ends which consist not in
immediate material possession, but in the satisfaction of a great
feeling that animates the collective body as with one soul.A people
having the seed of worthiness in it must feel an answering thrill when
it is adjured by the deaths of its heroes who died to preserve its
national existence; when it is reminded of its small beginnings and
gradual growth through past labours and struggles, such as are still
demanded of it in order that the freedom and wellbeing thus inherited
may be transmitted unimpaired to children and children's children; when
an appeal against the permission of injustice is made to great
precedents in its history and to the better genius breathing in its
institutions.It is this living force of sentiment in common which makes
a national consciousness.Nations so moved will resist conquest with
the very breasts of their women, will pay their millions and their blood
to abolish slavery, will share privation in famine and all calamity,
will produce poets to sing "some great story of a man," and thinkers
whose theories will bear the test of action.An individual man, to be
harmoniously great, must belong to a nation of this order, if not in
actual existence yet existing in the past, in memory, as a departed,
invisible, beloved ideal, once a reality, and perhaps to be restored.A
common humanity is not yet enough to feed the rich blood of various
activity which makes a complete man.The time is not come for
cosmopolitanism to be highly virtuous, any more than for communism to
suffice for social energy.I am not bound to feel for a Chinaman as I
feel for my fellow-countryman: I am bound not to demoralise him with
opium, not to compel him to my will by destroying or plundering the
fruits of his labour on the alleged ground that he is not cosmopolitan
enough, and not to insult him for his want of my tailoring and religion
when he appears as a peaceable visitor on the London pavement.It is
admirable in a Briton with a good purpose to learn Chinese, but it
would not be a proof of fine intellect in him to taste Chinese poetry in
the original more than he tastes the poetry of his own tongue.Affection, intelligence, duty, radiate from a centre, and nature has
decided that for us English folk that centre can be neither China nor
Peru.Most of us feel this unreflectingly; for the affectation of
undervaluing everything native, and being too fine for one's own
country, belongs only to a few minds of no dangerous leverage.What is
wanting is, that we should recognise a corresponding attachment to
nationality as legitimate in every other people, and understand that its
absence is a privation of the greatest good.For, to repeat, not only the nobleness of a nation depends on the
presence of this national consciousness, but also the nobleness of each
individual citizen.Our dignity and rectitude are proportioned to our
sense of relationship with something great, admirable, pregnant with
high possibilities, worthy of sacrifice, a continual inspiration to
self-repression and discipline by the presentation of aims larger and
more attractive to our generous part than the securing of personal ease
or prosperity.And a people possessing this good should surely feel not
only a ready sympathy with the effort of those who, having lost the
good, strive to regain it, but a profound pity for any degradation
resulting from its loss; nay, something more than pity when happier
nationalities have made victims of the unfortunate whose memories
nevertheless are the very fountain to which the persecutors trace their
most vaunted blessings.These notions are familiar: few will deny them in the abstract, and many
are found loudly asserting them in relation to this or the other
particular case.But here as elsewhere, in the ardent application of
ideas, there is a notable lack of simple comparison or sensibility to
resemblance.The European world has long been used to consider the Jews
as altogether exceptional, and it has followed naturally enough that
they have been excepted from the rules of justice and mercy, which are
based on human likeness.But to consider a people whose ideas have
determined the religion of half the world, and that the more cultivated
half, and who made the most eminent struggle against the power of Rome,
as a purely exceptional race, is a demoralising offence against rational
knowledge, a stultifying inconsistency in historical interpretation.Every nation of forcible character--i.e., of strongly marked
characteristics, is so far exceptional.The distinctive note of each
bird-species is in this sense exceptional, but the necessary ground of
such distinction is a deeper likeness.The superlative peculiarity in
the Jews admitted, our affinity with them is only the more apparent when
the elements of their peculiarity are discerned.From whatever point of view the writings of the Old Testament may be
regarded, the picture they present of a national development is of high
interest and speciality, nor can their historic momentousness be much
affected by any varieties of theory as to the relation they bear to the
New Testament or to the rise and constitution of Christianity.Whether
we accept the canonical Hebrew books as a revelation or simply as part
of an ancient literature, makes no difference to the fact that we find
there the strongly characterised portraiture of a people educated from
an earlier or later period to a sense of separateness unique in its
intensity, a people taught by many concurrent influences to identify
faithfulness to its national traditions with the highest social and
religious blessings.Our too scanty sources of Jewish history, from the
return under Ezra to the beginning of the desperate resistance against
Rome, show us the heroic and triumphant struggle of the Maccabees, which
rescued the religion and independence of the nation from the corrupting
sway of the Syrian Greeks, adding to the glorious sum of its memorials,
and stimulating continuous efforts of a more peaceful sort to maintain
and develop that national life which the heroes had fought and died for,
by internal measures of legal administration and public teaching.Thenceforth the virtuous elements of the Jewish life were engaged, as
they had been with varying aspects during the long and changeful
prophetic period and the restoration under Ezra, on the side of
preserving the specific national character against a demoralising fusion
with that of foreigners whose religion and ritual were idolatrous and
often obscene.There was always a Foreign party reviling the National
party as narrow, and sometimes manifesting their own breadth in
extensive views of advancement or profit to themselves by flattery of a
foreign power.Such internal conflict naturally tightened the bands of
conservatism, which needed to be strong if it were to rescue the sacred
ark, the vital spirit of a small nation--"the smallest of the
nations"--whose territory lay on the highway between three continents;
and when the dread and hatred of foreign sway had condensed itself into
dread and hatred of the Romans, many Conservatives became Zealots, whose
chief mark was that they advocated resistance to the death against the
submergence of their nationality.Much might be said on this point
towards distinguishing the desperate struggle against a conquest which
is regarded as degradation and corruption, from rash, hopeless
insurrection against an established native government; and for my part
(if that were of any consequence) I share the spirit of the Zealots.I
take the spectacle of the Jewish people defying the Roman edict, and
preferring death by starvation or the sword to the introduction of
Caligula's deified statue into the temple, as a sublime type of
steadfastness.But all that need be noticed here is the continuity of
that national education (by outward and inward circumstance) which
created in the Jews a feeling of race, a sense of corporate existence,
unique in its intensity.But not, before the dispersion, unique in essential qualities.There is
more likeness than contrast between the way we English got our island
and the way the Israelites got Canaan.We have not been noted for
forming a low estimate of ourselves in comparison with foreigners, or
for admitting that our institutions are equalled by those of any other
people under the sun.Many of us have thought that our sea-wall is a
specially divine arrangement to make and keep us a nation of sea-kings
after the manner of our forefathers, secure against invasion and able to
invade other lands when we need them, though they may lie on the other
side of the ocean.Again, it has been held that we have a peculiar
destiny as a Protestant people, not only able to bruise the head of an
idolatrous Christianity in the midst of us, but fitted as possessors of
the most truth and the most tonnage to carry our purer religion over the
world and convert mankind to our way of thinking.The Puritans,
asserting their liberty to restrain tyrants, found the Hebrew history
closely symbolical of their feelings and purpose; and it can hardly be
correct to cast the blame of their less laudable doings on the writings
they invoked, since their opponents made use of the same writings for
different ends, finding there a strong warrant for the divine right of
kings and the denunciation of those who, like Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,
took on themselves the office of the priesthood which belonged of right
solely to Aaron and his sons, or, in other words, to men ordained by the
English bishops.We must rather refer the passionate use of the Hebrew
writings to affinities of disposition between our own race and the
Jewish.Is it true that the arrogance of a Jew was so immeasurably
beyond that of a Calvinist?And the just sympathy and admiration which
we give to the ancestors who resisted the oppressive acts of our native
kings, and by resisting rescued or won for us the best part of our civil
and religious liberties--is it justly to be withheld from those brave
and steadfast men of Jewish race who fought and died, or strove by wise
administration to resist, the oppression and corrupting influences of
foreign tyrants, and by resisting rescued the nationality which was the
very hearth of our own religion?At any rate, seeing that the Jews were
more specifically than any other nation educated into a sense of their
supreme moral value, the chief matter of surprise is that any other
nation is found to rival them in this form of self-confidence.More exceptional--less like the course of our own history--has been
their dispersion and their subsistence as a separate people through ages
in which for the most part they were regarded and treated very much as
beasts hunted for the sake of their skins, or of a valuable secretion
peculiar to their species.The Jews showed a talent for accumulating
what was an object of more immediate desire to Christians than animal
oils or well-furred skins, and their cupidity and avarice were found at
once particularly hateful and particularly useful: hateful when seen as
a reason for punishing them by mulcting or robbery, useful when this
retributive process could be successfully carried forward.Kings and
emperors naturally were more alive to the usefulness of subjects who
could gather and yield money; but edicts issued to protect "the King's
Jews" equally with the King's game from being harassed and hunted by the
commonalty were only slight mitigations to the deplorable lot of a race
held to be under the divine curse, and had little force after the
Crusades began.As the slave-holders in the United States counted the
curse on Ham a justification of <DW64> slavery, so the curse on the Jews
was counted a justification for hindering them from pursuing agriculture
and handicrafts; for marking them out as execrable figures by a peculiar
dress; for torturing them to make them part with their gains, or for
more gratuitously spitting at them and pelting them; for taking it as
certain that they killed and ate babies, poisoned the wells, and took
pains to spread the plague; for putting it to them whether they would be
baptised or burned, and not failing to burn and massacre them when they
were obstinate; but also for suspecting them of disliking the baptism
when they had got it, and then burning them in punishment of their
insincerity; finally, for hounding them by tens on tens of thousands
from the homes where they had found shelter for centuries, and
inflicting on them the horrors of a new exile and a new dispersion.All
this to avenge the Saviour of mankind, or else to compel these
stiff-necked people to acknowledge a Master whose servants showed such
beneficent effects of His teaching.With a people so treated one of two issues was possible: either from
being of feebler nature than their persecutors, and caring more for ease
than for the sentiments and ideas which constituted their distinctive
character, they would everywhere give way to pressure and get rapidly
merged in the populations around them; or, being endowed with uncommon
tenacity, physical and mental, feeling peculiarly the ties of
inheritance both in blood and faith, remembering national glories,
trusting in their recovery, abhorring apostasy, able to bear all things
and hope all things with the consciousness of being steadfast to
spiritual obligations, the kernel of their number would harden into an
inflexibility more and more insured by motive and habit.They would
cherish all differences that marked them off from their hated
oppressors, all memories that consoled them with a sense of virtual
though unrecognised superiority; and the separateness which was made
their badge of ignominy would be their inward pride, their source of
fortifying defiance.Doubtless such a people would get confirmed in
vices.An oppressive government and a persecuting religion, while
breeding vices in those who hold power, are well known to breed
answering vices in those who are powerless and suffering.What more
direct plan than the course presented by European history could have
been pursued in order to give the Jews a spirit of bitter isolation, of
scorn for the wolfish hypocrisy that made victims of them, of triumph in
prospering at the expense of the blunderers who stoned them away from
the open paths of industry?--or, on the other hand, to encourage in the
less defiant a lying conformity, a pretence of conversion for the sake
of the social advantages attached to baptism, an outward renunciation of
their hereditary ties with the lack of real love towards the society
and creed which exacted this galling tribute?--or again, in the most
unhappy specimens of the race, to rear transcendent examples of odious
vice, reckless instruments of rich men with bad propensities,
unscrupulous grinders of the alien people who wanted to grind _them_?No wonder the Jews have their vices: no wonder if it were proved (which
it has not hitherto appeared to be) that some of them have a bad
pre-eminence in evil, an unrivalled superfluity of naughtiness.It would
be more plausible to make a wonder of the virtues which have prospered
among them under the shadow of oppression.But instead of dwelling on
these, or treating as admitted what any hardy or ignorant person may
deny, let us found simply on the loud assertions of the hostile.The
Jews, it is said, resisted the expansion of their own religion into
Christianity; they were in the habit of spitting on the cross; they have
held the name of Christ to be _Anathema_.The men
who made Christianity a curse to them: the men who made the name of
Christ a symbol for the spirit of vengeance, and, what was worse, made
the execution of the vengeance a pretext for satisfying their own
savageness, greed, and envy: the men who sanctioned with the name of
Christ a barbaric and blundering copy of pagan fatalism in taking the
words "His blood be upon us and on our children" as a divinely appointed
verbal warrant for wreaking cruelty from generation to generation on the
people from whose sacred writings Christ drew His teaching.Strange
retrogression in the professors of an expanded religion, boasting an
illumination beyond the spiritual doctrine of Hebrew prophets!For
Hebrew prophets proclaimed a God who demanded mercy rather than
sacrifices.The Christians also believed that God delighted not in the
blood of rams and of bulls, but they apparently conceived Him as
requiring for His satisfaction the sighs and groans, the blood and
roasted flesh of men whose forefathers had misunderstood the
metaphorical character of prophecies which spoke of spiritual
pre-eminence under the figure of a material kingdom.Was this the method
by which Christ desired His title to the Messiahship to be commended to
the hearts and understandings of the nation in which He was born?Many
of His sayings bear the stamp of that patriotism which places
fellow-countrymen in the inner circle of affection and duty.And did the
words "Father, forgive them, they know not what they do," refer only to
the centurion and his band, a tacit exception being made of every Hebrew
there present from the mercy of the Father and the compassion of the
Son?--nay, more, of every Hebrew yet to come who remained unconverted
after hearing of His claim to the Messiahship, not from His own lips or
those of His native apostles, but from the lips of alien men whom cross,
creed, and baptism had left cruel, rapacious, and debauched?It is more
reverent to Christ to believe that He must have approved the Jewish
martyrs who deliberately chose to be burned or massacred rather than be
guilty of a blaspheming lie, more than He approved the rabble of
crusaders who robbed and murdered them in His name.But these
remonstrances seem to have no direct application to personages who take
up the attitude of philosophic thinkers and discriminating critics,
professedly accepting Christianity from a rational point of view as a
vehicle of the highest religious and moral truth, and condemning the
Jews on the ground that they are obstinate adherents of an outworn
creed, maintain themselves in moral alienation from the peoples with
whom they share citizenship, and are destitute of real interest in the
welfare of the community and state with which they are thus identified.These anti-Judaic advocates usually belong to a party which has felt
itself glorified in winning for Jews, as well as Dissenters and
Catholics, the full privileges of citizenship, laying open to them every
path to distinction.At one time the voice of this party urged that
differences of creed were made dangerous only by the denial of
citizenship--that you must make a man a citizen before he could feel
like one.At present, apparently, this confidence has been succeeded by
a sense of mistake: there is a regret that no limiting clauses were
insisted on, such as would have hindered the Jews from coming too far
and in too large proportion along those opened pathways; and the
Roumanians are thought to have shown an enviable wisdom in giving them
as little chance as possible.But then, the reflection occurring that
some of the most objectionable Jews are baptised Christians, it is
obvious that such clauses would have been insufficient, and the doctrine
that you can turn a Jew into a good Christian is emphatically retracted.But clearly, these liberal gentlemen, too late enlightened by
disagreeable events, must yield the palm of wise foresight to those who
argued against them long ago; and it is a striking spectacle to witness
minds so panting for advancement in some directions that they are ready
to force it on an unwilling society, in this instance despairingly
recurring to mediaeval types of thinking--insisting that the Jews are
made viciously cosmopolitan by holding the world's money-bag, that for
them all national interests are resolved into the algebra of loans, that
they have suffered an inward degradation stamping them as morally
inferior, and--"serve them right," since they rejected Christianity.All
which is mirrored in an analogy, namely, that of the Irish, also a
servile race, who have rejected Protestantism though it has been
repeatedly urged on them by fire and sword and penal laws, and whose
place in the moral scale may be judged by our advertisements, where the
clause, "No Irish need apply," parallels the sentence which for many
polite persons sums up the question of Judaism--"I never _did_ like the
Jews."It is certainly worth considering whether an expatriated, denationalised
race, used for ages to live among antipathetic populations, must not
inevitably lack some conditions of nobleness.If they drop that
separateness which is made their reproach, they may be in danger of
lapsing into a cosmopolitan indifference equivalent to cynicism, and of
missing that inward identification with the nationality immediately
around them which might make some amends for their inherited privation.No dispassionate observer can deny this danger.Why, our own countrymen
who take to living abroad without purpose or function to keep up their
sense of fellowship in the affairs of their own land are rarely good
specimens of moral healthiness; still, the consciousness of having a
native country, the birthplace of common memories and habits of mind,
existing like a parental hearth quitted but beloved; the dignity of
being included in a people which has a part in the comity of nations
and the growing federation of the world; that sense of special belonging
which is the root of human virtues, both public and private,--all these
spiritual links may preserve migratory Englishmen from the worst
consequences of their voluntary dispersion.Unquestionably the Jews,
having been more than any other race exposed to the adverse moral
influences of alienism, must, both in individuals and in groups, have
suffered some corresponding moral degradation; but in fact they have
escaped with less of abjectness and less of hard hostility towards the
nations whose hand has been against them, than could have happened in
the case of a people who had neither their adhesion to a separate
religion founded on historic memories, nor their characteristic family
affectionateness.Tortured, flogged, spit upon, the _corpus vile_ on
which rage or wantonness vented themselves with impunity, their name
flung at them as an opprobrium by superstition, hatred, and contempt,
they have remained proud of their origin.Does any one call this an evil
pride?Perhaps he belongs to that order of man who, while he has a
democratic dislike to dukes and earls, wants to make believe that his
father was an idle gentleman, when in fact he was an honourable artisan,
or who would feel flattered to be taken for other than an Englishman.It
is possible to be too arrogant about our blood or our calling, but that
arrogance is virtue compared with such mean pretence.The pride which
identifies us with a great historic body is a humanising, elevating
habit of mind, inspiring sacrifices of individual comfort, gain, or
other selfish ambition, for the sake of that ideal whole; and no man
swayed by such a sentiment can become completely abject.That a Jew of
Smyrna, where a whip is carried by passengers ready to flog off the too
officious specimens of his race, can still be proud to say, "I am a
Jew," is surely a fact to awaken admiration in a mind capable of
understanding what we may call the ideal forces in human history.And
again, a varied, impartial observation of the Jews in different
countries tends to the impression that they have a predominant
kindliness which must have been deeply ingrained in the constitution of
their race to have outlasted the ages of persecution and oppression.The concentration of their joys in domestic life has kept up in them the
capacity of tenderness: the pity for the fatherless and the widow, the
care for the women and the little ones, blent intimately with their
religion, is a well of mercy that cannot long or widely be pent up by
exclusiveness.And the kindliness of the Jew overflows the line of
division between him and the Gentile.On the whole, one of the most
remarkable phenomena in the history of this scattered people, made for
ages "a scorn and a hissing" is, that after being subjected to this
process, which might have been expected to be in every sense
deteriorating and vitiating, they have come out of it (in any estimate
which allows for numerical proportion) rivalling the nations of all
European countries in healthiness and beauty of _physique_, in practical
ability, in scientific and artistic aptitude, and in some forms of
ethical value.A significant indication of their natural rank is seen in
the fact that at this moment, the leader of the Liberal party in Germany
is a Jew, the leader of the Republican party in France is a Jew, and the
head of the Conservative ministry in England is a Jew.And here it is
that we find the ground for the obvious jealousy which is now
stimulating the revived expression of old antipathies."The Jews," it is
felt, "have a dangerous tendency to get the uppermost places not only in
commerce but in political life.Their monetary hold on governments is
tending to perpetuate in leading Jews a spirit of universal alienism
(euphemistically called cosmopolitanism), even where the West has given
them a full share in civil and political rights.A people with oriental
sunlight in their blood, yet capable of being everywhere acclimatised,
they have a force and toughness which enables them to carry off the best
prizes; and their wealth is likely to put half the seats in Parliament
at their disposal."There is truth in these views of Jewish social and political relations.But it is rather too late for liberal pleaders to urge them in a merely
vituperative sense.Do they propose as a remedy for the impending danger
of our healthier national influences getting overridden by Jewish
predominance, that we should repeal our emancipatory laws?Not all the
Germanic immigrants who have been settling among us for generations,
and are still pouring in to settle, are Jews, but thoroughly Teutonic
and more or less Christian craftsmen, mechanicians, or skilled and
erudite functionaries; and the Semitic Christians who swarm among us are
dangerously like their unconverted brethren in complexion, persistence,
and wealth.Then there are the Greeks who, by the help of Phoenician
blood or otherwise, are objectionably strong in the city.Some judges
think that the Scotch are more numerous and prosperous here in the South
than is quite for the good of us Southerners; and the early
inconvenience felt under the Stuarts of being quartered upon by a
hungry, hard-working people with a distinctive accent and form of
religion, and higher cheek-bones than English taste requires, has not
yet been quite neutralised.As for the Irish, it is felt in high
quarters that we have always been too lenient towards them;--at least,
if they had been harried a little more there might not have been so many
of them on the English press, of which they divide the power with the
Scotch, thus driving many Englishmen to honest and ineloquent labour.So far shall we be carried if we go in search of devices to hinder
people of other blood than our own from getting the advantage of
dwelling among us.Let it be admitted that it is a calamity to the English, as to any other
great historic people, to undergo a premature fusion with immigrants of
alien blood; that its distinctive national characteristics should be in
danger of obliteration by the predominating quality of foreign settlers.I not only admit this, I am ready to unite in groaning over the
threatened danger.To one who loves his native language, who would
delight to keep our rich and harmonious English undefiled by foreign
accent, foreign intonation, and those foreign tinctures of verbal
meaning which tend to confuse all writing and discourse, it is an
affliction as harassing as the climate, that on our stage, in our
studios, at our public and private gatherings, in our offices,
warehouses, and workshops, we must expect to hear our beloved English
with its words clipped, its vowels stretched and twisted, its phrases of
acquiescence and politeness, of cordiality, dissidence or argument,
delivered always in the wrong tones, like ill-rendered melodies, marred
beyond recognition; that there should be a general ambition to speak
every language except our mother English, which persons "of style" are
not ashamed of corrupting with slang, false foreign equivalents, and a
pronunciation that crushes out all colour from the vowels and jams them
between jostling consonants.An ancient Greek might not like to be
resuscitated for the sake of hearing Homer read in our universities,
still he would at least find more instructive marvels in other
developments to be witnessed at those institutions; but a modern
Englishman is invited from his after-dinner repose to hear Shakspere
delivered under circumstances which offer no other novelty than some
novelty of false intonation, some new distribution of strong emphasis on
prepositions, some new misconception of a familiar idiom.it is
our inertness that is in fault, our carelessness of excellence, our
willing ignorance of the treasures that lie in our national heritage,
while we are agape after what is foreign, though it may be only a vile
imitation of what is native.This marring of our speech, however, is a minor evil compared with what
must follow from the predominance of wealth--acquiring immigrants, whose
appreciation of our political and social life must often be as
approximative or fatally erroneous as their delivery of our language.But take the worst issues--what can we do to hinder them?Are we to
adopt the exclusiveness for which we have punished the Chinese?Are we
to tear the glorious flag of hospitality which has made our freedom the
world-wide blessing of the oppressed?It is not agreeable to find
foreign accents and stumbling locutions passing from the piquant
exception to the general rule of discourse.But to urge on that account
that we should spike away the peaceful foreigner, would be a view of
international relations not in the long-run favourable to the interests
of our fellow-countrymen; for we are at least equal to the races we call
obtrusive in the disposition to settle wherever money is to be made and
cheaply idle living to be found.In meeting the national evils which are
brought upon us by the onward course of the world, there is often no
more immediate hope or resource than that of striving after fuller
national excellence, which must consist in the moulding of more
excellent individual natives.The tendency of things is towards the
quicker or slower fusion of races.It is impossible to arrest this
tendency: all we can do is to moderate its course so as to hinder it
from degrading the moral status of societies by a too rapid effacement
of those national traditions and customs which are the language of the
national genius--the deep suckers of healthy sentiment.Such moderating
and guidance of inevitable movement is worthy of all effort.And it is
in this sense that the modern insistance on the idea of Nationalities
has value.That any people at once distinct and coherent enough to form
a state should be held in subjection by an alien antipathetic government
has been becoming more and more a ground of sympathetic indignation; and
in virtue of this, at least one great State has been added to European
councils.Nobody now complains of the result in this case, though
far-sighted persons see the need to limit analogy by discrimination.We
have to consider who are the stifled people and who the stiflers before
we can be sure of our ground.The only point in this connection on which Englishmen are agreed is,
that England itself shall not be subject to foreign rule.The fiery
resolve to resist invasion, though with an improvised array of
pitchforks, is felt to be virtuous, and to be worthy of a historic
people.Because there is a national life in our veins.Because
there is something specifically English which we feel to be supremely
worth striving for, worth dying for, rather than living to renounce it.Because we too have our share--perhaps a principal share--in that spirit
of separateness which has not yet done its work in the education of
mankind, which has created the varying genius of nations, and, like the
Muses, is the offspring of memory.Here, as everywhere else, the human task seems to be the discerning and
adjustment of opposite claims.But the end can hardly be achieved by
urging contradictory reproaches, and instead of labouring after
discernment as a preliminary to intervention, letting our zeal burst
forth according to a capricious selection, first determined accidentally
and afterwards justified by personal predilection.Not only John Gilpin
and his wife, or Edwin and Angelina, seem to be of opinion that their
preference or dislike of Russians, Servians, or Greeks, consequent,
perhaps, on hotel adventures, has something to do with the merits of the
Eastern Question; even in a higher range of intellect and enthusiasm we
find a distribution of sympathy or pity for sufferers of different blood
or votaries of differing religions, strangely unaccountable on any other
ground than a fortuitous direction of study or trivial circumstances of
travel.With some even admirable persons, one is never quite sure of any
particular being included under a general term.A provincial physician,
it is said, once ordering a lady patient not to eat salad, was asked
pleadingly by the affectionate husband whether she might eat lettuce, or
cresses, or radishes.The physician had too rashly believed in the
comprehensiveness of the word "salad," just as we, if not enlightened by
experience, might believe in the all-embracing breadth of "sympathy with
the injured and oppressed."What mind can exhaust the grounds of
exception which lie in each particular case?There is understood to be a
peculiar odour from the <DW64> body, and we know that some persons, too
rationalistic to feel bound by the curse on Ham, used to hint very
strongly that this odour determined the question on the side of <DW64>
slavery.And this is the usual level of thinking in polite society concerning the
Jews.Apart from theological purposes, it seems to be held surprising
that anybody should take an interest in the history of a people whose
literature has furnished all our devotional language; and if any
reference is made to their past or future destinies some hearer is sure
to state as a relevant fact which may assist our judgment, that she, for
her part, is not fond of them, having known a Mr Jacobson who was very
unpleasant, or that he, for his part, thinks meanly of them as a race,
though on inquiry you find that he is so little acquainted with their
characteristics that he is astonished to learn how many persons whom he
has blindly admired and applauded are Jews to the backbone.Again, men
who consider themselves in the very van of modern advancement, knowing
history and the latest philosophies of history, indicate their
contemptuous surprise that any one should entertain the destiny of the
Jews as a worthy subject, by referring to Moloch and their own
agreement with the theory that the religion of Jehovah was merely a
transformed Moloch-worship, while in the same breath they are glorifying
"civilisation" as a transformed tribal existence of which some
lineaments are traceable in grim marriage customs of the native
Australians.Are these erudite persons prepared to insist that the name
"Father" should no longer have any sanctity for us, because in their
view of likelihood our Aryan ancestors were mere improvers on a state of
things in which nobody knew his own father?For less theoretic men, ambitious, to be regarded as practical
politicians, the value of the Hebrew race has been measured by their
unfavourable opinion of a prime minister who is a Jew by lineage.But it
is possible to form a very ugly opinion as to the scrupulousness of
Walpole or of Chatham; and in any case I think Englishmen would refuse
to accept the character and doings of those eighteenth century statesmen
as the standard of value for the English people and the part they have
to play in the fortunes of mankind.If we are to consider the future of the Jews at all, it seems
reasonable to take as a preliminary question: Are they destined to
complete fusion with the peoples among whom they are dispersed, losing
every remnant of a distinctive consciousness as Jews; or, are there in
the breadth and intensity with which the feeling of separateness, or
what we may call the organised memory of a national consciousness,
actually exists in the world-wide Jewish communities--the seven millions
scattered from east to west--and again, are there in the political
relations of the world, the conditions present or approaching for the
restoration of a Jewish state planted on the old ground as a centre of
national feeling, a source of dignifying protection, a special channel
for special energies which may contribute some added form of national
genius, and an added voice in the councils of the world?They are among us everywhere: it is useless to say we are not fond of
them.Perhaps we are not fond of proletaries and their tendency to form
Unions, but the world is not therefore to be rid of them.If we wish to
free ourselves from the inconveniences that we have to complain of,
whether in proletaries or in Jews, our best course is to encourage all
means of improving these neighbours who elbow us in a thickening crowd,
and of sending their incommodious energies into beneficent channels.Why
are we so eager for the dignity of certain populations of whom perhaps
we have never seen a single specimen, and of whose history, legend, or
literature we have been contentedly ignorant for ages, while we sneer at
the notion of a renovated national dignity for the Jews, whose ways of
thinking and whose very verbal forms are on our lips in every prayer
which we end with an Amen?Some of us consider this question dismissed
when they have said that the wealthiest Jews have no desire to forsake
their European palaces, and go to live in Jerusalem.But in a return
from exile, in the restoration of a people, the question is not whether
certain rich men will choose to remain behind, but whether there will be
found worthy men who will choose to lead the return.Plenty of
prosperous Jews remained in Babylon when Ezra marshalled his band of
forty thousand and began a new glorious epoch in the history of his
race, making the preparation for that epoch in the history of the world
which has been held glorious enough to be dated from for evermore.The
hinge of possibility is simply the existence of an adequate community of
feeling as well as widespread need in the Jewish race, and the hope that
among its finer specimens there may arise some men of instruction and
ardent public spirit, some new Ezras, some modern Maccabees, who will
know how to use all favouring outward conditions, how to triumph by
heroic example, over the indifference of their fellows and the scorn of
their foes, and will steadfastly set their faces towards making their
people once more one among the nations.Formerly, evangelical orthodoxy was prone to dwell on the fulfilment of
prophecy in the "restoration of the Jews," Such interpretation of the
prophets is less in vogue now.The dominant mode is to insist on a
Christianity that disowns its origin, that is not a substantial growth
having a genealogy, but is a vaporous reflex of modern notions.The
Christ of Matthew had the heart of a Jew--"Go ye first to the lost
sheep of the house of Israel."The Apostle of the Gentiles had the heart
of a Jew: "For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my
brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh: who are Israelites; to whom
pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the
giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises; whose are
the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came."Modern
apostles, extolling Christianity, are found using a different tone: they
prefer the mediaeval cry translated into modern phrase.But the
mediaeval cry too was in substance very ancient--more ancient than the
days of Augustus.Pagans in successive ages said, "These people are
unlike us, and refuse to be made like us: let us punish them."The Jews
were steadfast in their separateness, and through that separateness
Christianity was born.A modern book on Liberty has maintained that from
the freedom of individual men to persist in idiosyncrasies the world may
be enriched.Why should we not apply this argument to the idiosyncrasy
of a nation, and pause in our haste to hoot it down?There is still a
great function for the steadfastness of the Jew: not that he should
shut out the utmost illumination which knowledge can throw on his
national history, but that he should cherish the store of inheritance
which that history has left him.Every Jew should be conscious that he
is one of a multitude possessing common objects of piety in the immortal
achievements and immortal sorrows of ancestors who have transmitted to
them a physical and mental type strong enough, eminent enough in
faculties, pregnant enough with peculiar promise, to constitute a new
beneficent individuality among the nations, and, by confuting the
traditions of scorn, nobly avenge the wrongs done to their Fathers.There is a sense in which the worthy child of a nation that has brought
forth illustrious prophets, high and unique among the poets of the
world, is bound by their visions.Yes, for the effective bond of human action is feeling, and the worthy
child of a people owning the triple name of Hebrew, Israelite, and Jew,
feels his kinship with the glories and the sorrows, the degradation and
the possible renovation of his national family.Will any one teach the nullification of this feeling and call his
doctrine a philosophy?He will teach a blinding superstition--the
superstition that a theory of human wellbeing can be constructed in
disregard of the influences which have made us human.The piercing eyes seemed to grow more piercing, the long upper
lip to become longer."Yes," Crichton hesitated--it is so difficult to invent a plausible
story on the spur of the moment."In fact, I met her quite unexpectedly
in Newhaven."I have just arrived from France," continued Crichton more
fluently."I was most astonished
to meet my wife in England as I had been looking for her in Paris for
the last week."For the last few months
she has been confined in an asylum."Crichton spoke with increasing
assurance."It is called Charleroi and is about thirty miles from Paris in the
direction of Fontainebleau.""And you suggest that it was there that she was ill-treated.Let me tell
you----"

Cyril interrupted him.My wife escaped from Charleroi over a week
ago.We know she went to Paris, but there we lost all trace of her.Imagine my astonishment at finding her on the train this morning.How
she got there, I can't think.She seemed very much agitated, but I
attributed that to my presence.I have lately had a most unfortunate
effect upon her.I did ask her how she got the bruise on her cheek, but
she wouldn't tell me.If I had been
guilty of the condition she is in, is it likely that I should have
brought her to a man of your reputation and character?The doctor stared at him fixedly for a few moments as if weighing the
credibility of his explanation."You say that the physician under whose care your wife has been is
called Monet?"When he returned, his bearing had
completely changed."I have just verified your statement in a French medical directory and I
must apologise to you for having jumped at conclusions in the way I did.Pray, forgive me----"

Crichton bowed rather distantly.He didn't feel over-kindly to the man
who had forced him into such a quagmire of lies."Now as to--" Cyril hesitated a moment; he detested calling the girl by
his name."Now--as to--to--the patient.Have you any idea when she is
likely to recover consciousness?"Of course, what you tell me of her mental condition
increases the seriousness of the case.With hysterical cases anything
and everything is possible.""But you do not fear the--worst."I see
no reason why she should not recover.Now if you would like to remain
near her----"

There seemed a conspiracy to keep him forever at the girl's side, but
this time he meant to break away even if he had to fight for it."I shall, of course, remain near her," Cyril interrupted hastily."I
have taken lodgings in Half Moon Street and shall stay there till she
has completely recovered.As she has lately shown the most violent
dislike of me, I think I had better not attempt to see her for the
present."I shall call daily to find out how she is, and if there is any change
in her condition, you will, of course, notify me at once."Crichton took
out a card and scribbled his address on it.And now I have a rather delicate request to make.Would you mind not
letting any one know the identity of your patient?You see I have every
hope that she will eventually recover her reason and therefore I wish
her malady to be kept a secret.I have told my friends that my wife is
in the south of France undergoing a species of rest cure."I shall not mention her name to any one.""It is a rule of all nursing homes that a patient's name is never to be
mentioned to an outsider.But if you wish to take extra precautions, you
might give her another name while she is here and they need never know
that it is not her own."Peter Thompkins, and I will become Mr.Please address
all communications to me under that name; otherwise the truth is sure to
leak out.""But how will you arrange to get your mail?""Peter Thompkins is my valet, so that is quite simple."I trust I shall soon have a better
report to give you of Mrs.A moment later Cyril was in a taxi speeding towards Mayfair, a free
man--for the moment.CHAPTER III

THE TRIBULATIONS OF A LIAR


While Crichton was dressing he glanced from time to time at his valet.Peter had evidently been deeply shocked by the incident at the railway
station, for the blunt profile, so persistently presented to him, was
austerely remote as well as subtly disapproving.Cyril was fond of the
old man, who had been his father's servant and had known him almost from
his infancy.He felt that he owed him some explanation, particularly as
he had without consulting him made use of his name.Never before had he so fully realised the
joy, the comfort, the dignity of truth.It was not a virtue he decided;
it was a privilege.If he ever got out of the hole he was in, he meant
to wallow in it for the future.That happy time seemed, however, still
far distant.Believing the girl to be innocent, he wanted as few people as possible
to know the nature of the cloud which hung over her.Peter's loyalty, he
knew, he could count on, that had been often and fully proved; but his
discretion was another matter.If he had anything to
conceal, even his silence became so portentous of mystery that it could
not fail to arouse the curiosity of the most unsuspicious.No, he must
think of some simple story which would satisfy Peter as to the propriety
of his conduct and yet which, if it leaked out, would not be to the
girl's discredit."You must have been surprised to hear me give my name to the young lady
you saw at the station," he began tentatively.So much at any rate must be true, thought
poor Cyril with some satisfaction."I don't feel at liberty to repeat what she told me."Certainly, sir," agreed Peter, but his face fell."So all I can tell you is that she was escaping from a brute who
horribly ill-treated her."Unfortunately she was taken ill before she had told me her name or who
the friends were with whom she was seeking refuge.If
the police heard that a young girl had been found unconscious on the
train, the fact would have been advertised far and wide so as to enable
them to establish her identity, in which case the person from whom she
was hiding would have taken possession of her, which he has a legal
right to do--so she gave me to understand."Crichton paused quite out of
breath.Peter was swallowing his tale
unquestionably--and really, you know, for an inexperienced liar that was
a reasonably probable story."So you see," he continued, "it was
necessary for her to have a name and mine was the only one which would
not provoke further inquiry.""Begging your pardon, sir, but I should 'ave thought that Smith or Jones
would 'ave done just as well."The authorities would have wanted further particulars
and would at once have detected the fraud.No one will ever know that I
lent an unfortunate woman for a few hours the protection of my name, and
there is no one who has the right to object to my having done so--except
the young lady herself.""On the other hand, on account of the position I am in at present, it is
most important that I should do nothing which could by any possibility
be misconstrued.""And so I told the doctor that the young lady had better not be called
by my name while she is at the home and so--and so--well--in fact--I
gave her yours."Yes, you see you haven't got a wife, have you?""So there couldn't be any possible complications in your case.""One never can tell, sir--a name's a name and females are sometimes not
over-particular."Why, you ought to feel proud to be able to be of use
to a charming lady."I don't know, sir, but I do 'ope she's respectable," he answered
miserably.Don't you know a lady when you see one?""I'm sorry you feel like that about it," said Crichton."It never
occurred to me you would mind, and I haven't yet told you all.I not
only gave the young lady your name but took it myself."At the nursing home I am known as Mr.Pray that I
don't disgrace you, Peter."If you get found out, they'll never believe you
are hinnocent when you've done a thing like that.Of course, a gentleman
like you hought to know his own business best, but it do seem to me most
awful risky.""Well, it's a risk that had to be taken.It was a choice of evils, I
grant you.I sniff breakfast; the bacon and eggs of my country
await me.I am famishing, and I say, Peter, do try to take a more
cheerful view of this business."Crichton was still at breakfast when a short, red-haired young man
fairly burst into the room."Hullo, old chap, glad to see you," cried the newcomer, pounding Cyril
affectionately on the back.I say, your telephone message
gave me quite a turn."If I look calm, my looks belie me.I assure you I never felt less calm
in my life.""Well, then, take a cigarette, pull up that chair to the fire, and
listen--and don't play the fool; this is serious.""I want your legal advice, Guy, though I suppose you'll tell me I need a
solicitor, not a barrister.Why, Cyril, I am awfully sorry.I had heard that your
marriage hadn't turned out any too well, but I had no idea it was as bad
as that.I never have heard anything against your
wife's character.""You mean that you have never heard that she was unfaithful to me.Bah,
it makes me sick the way people talk, as if infidelity were the only
vice that damned a woman's character.Guy, her character was rotten
through and through.Her infidelity was simply a minor, though
culminating, expression of it.""But how did you come to marry such a person?""You know she was the Chalmerses' governess?""I had been spending a few weeks with them.Jack, the oldest son, was a
friend of mine and she was the daughter of a brother officer of old
Chalmers's who had died in India, and consequently her position in the
household was different from that of an ordinary governess.I soon got
quite friendly with Amy and her two charges, and we used to rag about
together a good deal.I liked her, but upon my honour I hadn't a thought
of making love to her.They accused
her of carrying on a clandestine love affair with Freddy, the second
son, and with drinking on the sly.They had found empty bottles hidden
in her bedroom.She posed as injured innocence--the victim of a vile
plot to get her out of the house--had no money, no friends, no hope of
another situation.I was dreadfully sorry
for her and so--well, I married her.As the regiment had just been
ordered to South Africa, we went there immediately.We had not been
married a year, however, when I discovered that she was a confirmed
drunkard.I think only the fear of losing her position had kept her
within certain bounds.That necessity removed, she seemed unable to put
any restraint on herself.I doubt if she even tried to do so.""Later on I found out that she was taking drugs as well as stimulants.She would drink herself into a frenzy and then stupefy herself with
opiates.But it is not only weakness I am accusing her of.She was
inherently deceitful and cruel--ah, what is the use of talking about it!"You haven't been living together lately, have you?""Well, you see, she was disgracing not only herself but the regiment,
and so it became a question of either leaving the army or getting her to
live somewhere else.So I brought her back to Europe, took a small villa
near Pau, and engaged an efficient nurse-companion to look after her.I
spent my leave with her, but that was all.Last spring, however, she got
so bad that her companion cabled for me.For a few weeks she was
desperately ill, and when she partially recovered, the doctor persuaded
me to send her to a sanitarium for treatment.It was chiefly celebrated as a lunatic asylum, but it has an
annex where dipsomaniacs and drug fiends are cared for.At first, the
doctor's reports were very discouraging, but lately her improvement is
said to have been quite astonishing, so much so that it was decided that
I should take her away for a little trip.I was on my way to Charleroi,
when the news reached me that Amy had escaped.We soon discovered that
she had fled with a M. de Brissac, who had been discharged as cured the
day before my wife's disappearance.We traced them to within a few miles
of Paris, but there lost track of them.I have, however, engaged a
detective to furnish me with further particulars.I fancy the Frenchman
is keeping out of the way for fear I shall kill him.Why, I pity
him, that is all!He'll soon find out what that woman is like.Oh, you can't realise what that means to me.I only
wish my father were alive to know that I have this chance of beginning
life over again.""I was so sorry to hear of his death.He was always so kind to us boys
when we stayed at Lingwood.I wrote you when I heard the sad news, but
you never answered any of my letters.""I know, old chap, but you must forgive me.I have been too
miserable--too ashamed.I only wanted to creep away and to be
forgotten.""Your father died in Paris, didn't he?"It was just after I had taken Amy to
Charleroi.He never got over the mess I had
made of my life and Wilmersley's marriage was the last straw."Why had your father been so sure that Lord Wilmersley would never
marry?He was an old bachelor, but not so very old after all.He can't
be more than fifty now.""Well, you see, Wilmersley has a bee in his bonnet.His mother was a
Spanish ballet dancer whom my uncle married when he was a mere boy.I remember her distinctly, a great, fat
woman with a big, white face and enormous, glassy, black eyes.She died when Wilmersley was about twenty and my
uncle followed her a few months later.His funeral was hardly over when
my cousin left Geralton and nothing definite was heard of him for almost
twenty-five years.He was supposed to be travelling in the far East, and
from time to time some pretty queer rumours drifted back about him.Whether they were true or not, I have never known.One day he returned
to Geralton as unexpectedly as he had left it.He has immense family pride--the ballet dancer, I fancy, rankles--and
having decided for some reason or other not to marry, he wished his heir
to cut a dash.He offered me an allowance of L4000 a year, told me to
marry as soon as possible, and sent me home.""Well, that was pretty decent of him.He's a most repulsive-looking chap, a thorough
Spaniard, with no trace of his father's blood that I can see.And as I
married soon afterwards and my marriage was not to his liking, he
stopped my allowance and swore I should never succeed him if he could
help it.So you see I haven't much reason to be grateful to him."He married Miss Mannering, Lady Upton's granddaughter,
didn't he?""She is a little queer, I believe."I have never seen her, but I hear she is
very pretty.Well, I'm sorry for her, brought up by that old curmudgeon
of a grandmother and married out of the schoolroom to Wilmersley.She
has never had much of a chance, has she?""So that now that your father is dead, you are the immediate heir."The door was flung open and Peter rushed into the room brandishing a
paper."Oh, sir, it's come at last!"What on earth is the matter with you?""I beg pardon, sir, but I am that hovercome!I heard them crying
'hextras,' so I went out and gets one--just casual-like.Little did I
think what would be in it--and there it was."Both men spoke at once, leaning eagerly forward."That Lord Wilmersley is dead; and so, my lord, I wish you much joy and
a long life.""This is very sudden," gasped Crichton.CHAPTER IV

ON THE SCENE OF THE TRAGEDY


"When, how, who did it?""Murder of Lord Wilmersley--disappearance of Lady Wilmersley," he read."Disappearance of Lady Wilmersley," he repeated, as the paper fell from
his limp hand."Here, get your master some whiskey; the shock has been too much for
him," said Camp bell."Mysterious disappearance of Lady Wilmersley,"
murmured Crichton, staring blankly in front of him."Here, drink this, old man; you'll be all right in a moment," said
Campbell, pressing a glass into his hand.he cried, covering his face with his hands."'The body of Lord Wilmersley was found at seven o'clock this morning
floating in the swimming bath at Geralton.It was at first thought that
death had been caused by drowning, but on examination, a bullet wound
was discovered over the heart.Search for the pistol with which the
crime was committed has so far proved fruitless.The corpse was dressed
in a long, Eastern garment frequently worn by the deceased.Lady
Wilmersley's bedroom, which adjoins the swimming bath, was empty.A hurried search of the castle and grounds
was at once made, but no trace of her ladyship has been discovered.It
is feared that she also has been murdered and her body thrown into the
lake, which is only a short distance from the castle.None of her
wearing apparel is missing, even the dress and slippers she wore on the
previous evening were found in a corner of her room.Robbery was
probably the motive of the crime, as a small safe, which stands next to
Lady Wilmersley's bed and contained her jewels, has been rifled.Whoever
did this must, however, have known the combination, as the lock has not
been tampered with.Lady
Wilmersley is said to be mentally unbalanced.Arthur Edward Crichton,
9th Baron Wilmersley, was born--' here follows a history of your family,
Cyril, you don't want to hear that.I can't think," said Crichton."I don't believe Lady Wilmersley was murdered," said Campbell."Why
should a murderer have troubled to remove one body and not the other?Mark my words, it was his wife who killed Wilmersley and opened the
safe.""Besides, how
could she have got away without a dress or hat?Remember they make a
point of the fact that none of her clothes are missing.""In the first place, you can't believe everything you read in a
newspaper; but even granting the correctness of that statement, what was
there to prevent her having borrowed a dress from one of her maids?She
must have had one, you know."It can't be, I tell you; I--" Cyril stopped abruptly.You look as guilty as though you had killed
him yourself.I can't for the life of me see why you take the thing so
terribly to heart.You didn't like your cousin and from what you
yourself tell me, I fancy he is no great loss to any one, and you don't
know his wife--widow, I mean.""It is such a shock," stammered Cyril."Of course it's a shock, but you ought to think of your new duties.You
will have to go to Geralton at once?""Yes, I suppose it will be expected of me," Cyril assented gloomily."Peter, pack my things and find out when the next train leaves.""And Guy, you will come with me, won't you?I really can't face this
business alone.Besides, your legal knowledge may come in useful.""I am awfully sorry, but I really can't come to-day.I've got to be in
court this afternoon; but I'll come as soon as I can, if you really want
me.""Of course I want to be of use if I can, but a detective is really what
you need."Don't look as if I had suggested your hiring a camel!""Yes, of course not--I mean a detective is--would be--in fact--very
useful," stammered Cyril."Why not get one and take him down with you?"Cyril hurriedly objected, "I don't think I had better do that.Shouldn't like to begin by hurting local
feeling and--and all that, you know.""At any rate, I'm not going to engage any one till I've looked into the
matter myself," said Cyril."If I find I need a man, I'll wire."Campbell, grumbling about unnecessary delay, let the matter drop.Two hours later Cyril was speeding towards Newhaven.Huddled in a corner of the railway carriage, he gave himself up to the
gloomiest reflections.Was ever any one pursued by such persistent
ill-luck?It seemed too hard that just as he began to see an end to his
matrimonial troubles, he should have tumbled headlong into this terrible
predicament.From the moment he heard of Lady Wilmersley's disappearance
he had never had the shadow of a doubt but that it was she he had
rescued that morning from the police.What was he going to do, now that
he knew her identity?He must decide on a course of action at once.He felt he couldn't do that--at least, not yet.But unless he immediately and voluntarily confessed the truth, who would
believe him if it ever came to light?If it were discovered that he, the
heir, had helped his cousin's murderess to escape--had posed as her
husband, would any one, would any jury believe that chance alone had
thrown them together?He might prove an alibi, but that would only save
his life--not his honour.He would always be suspected of having
instigated, if not actually committed, the murder.If, however, by some miracle the truth did not leak out, what then?It
would mean that from this day forward he would live in constant fear of
detection.The very fact of her secret existence must necessarily poison
his whole life.Lies, lies, lies would be his future portion.Was he
willing to assume such a burden?Was it his duty to take upon himself
the charge of a woman who was after all but a homicidal maniac?Again and again he went over each incident of their
meeting, weighed her every word and action, and again he found it
impossible to believe that her mind was unbalanced.Yet if she was not
insane, what excuse could he find to explain her crime?He had once been present when a murderer was sentenced: "To hang
by the neck until you are dead," the words rang in his ears.That small
white neck--no--never.Suddenly he realised that his path was
irrevocably chosen.As long as she needed him, he would protect her to
the uttermost of his ability.Even if his efforts proved futile, even if
he ruined his life without saving hers, he felt he would never regret
his decision.It seemed centuries since he had left it that morning.Hiring a fly, he
drove out to Geralton, a distance of nine miles.There the door was
opened by the same butler who had admitted him five years previously."Why, sir, they all
told us as 'ow you were in South Africa."Thank you, sir,--my lord, I mean, and please forgive your being
received like this--but every one is so upset, there's no doing nothing
with nobody.If you will step in 'ere, I'll call Mrs.Eversley, the
'ousekeeper."She used to
stuff me with doughnuts when I came here as a boy."Now I want to hear all the particulars of the tragedy.The newspaper
account was very meagre.""Quite so, my lord," assented the butler."Lady Wilmersley has not been found?"We've searched for her ladyship 'igh and low.And now every one says as 'ow she did it.But I'll never believe
it--never.A gentle little lady, she was, and so easily frightened!Why,
if my lord so much as looked at her sometimes, she'd fall a trembling,
and 'e always so kind and devoted to 'er.'E just doted on 'er, 'e did."If you don't believe her ladyship guilty, is there any one else you do
suspect?""No, my lord, I can't say as I do.""It was a
burglar, I believe.I think the detective----"

"What detective?""His name is Judson; 'e comes from London and they say as 'e can find a
murderer just by looking at the chair 'e sat in."He said we owed it to 'er ladyship
to hemploy the best talent.""'E's in the long drawing-room with Mr."No, the corpse won't be sat on till to-morrow morning.""Show me the way to the drawing-room.The butler preceded him across the hall and throwing open a door
announced in a loud voice:

"Lord Wilmersley."Four men who had been deep in conversation
turned and stared open-mouthed at Cyril, and one of them, a short fat
man in clerical dress, dropped his teacup in his agitation.bellowed a tall, florid old gentleman.The butler, secretly delighted at having produced such a sensation,
closed the door discreetly after him."I don't wonder you are surprised to see me.You thought I was with my
regiment.""So you're the little shaver I knew as a boy?Well, you've grown a bit
since then.Then, recollecting the solemnity of the occasion,
he subdued his voice."I'm Twombley, friend of your father's, you know,
and this is Mr.James, your vicar, and this is Mr.Tinker, the coroner,
and this is Judson, celebrated detective, you know."It has been a great shock to me, and I am very glad to have Judson's
assistance," replied Cyril, casting a searching and apprehensive glance
at the detective.He was a small, clean-shaven man with short, grey hair, grey eyebrows,
grey complexion, dressed in a grey tweed suit.His features were
peculiarly indefinite.His half-closed eyes, lying in the shadow of the
overhanging brows, were fringed with light eyelashes and gave no accent
to his expressionless face.At all events, thought Cyril, he doesn't look very alarming, but then,
you never can tell."I must condole with you on the unexpected loss of a relative, who was
in every way an honour to his name and his position," said the vicar,
holding out a podgy hand.Cyril was so taken aback at this unexpected tribute to his cousin's
memory that he was only able to murmur a discreet "Thank you.""The late Lord Wilmersley," said the coroner, "was a most
public-spirited man and is a loss to the county.""Quite so, quite so," assented Mr."Gave a good bit to the
hunt, though he never hunted."I haven't done much of it lately, but I shall certainly do so in
future.""Your cousin," interrupted the vicar, "was a man of deep religious
convictions.His long stay in heathen lands had only strengthened his
devotion to the true faith.His pew was never empty and he subscribed
liberally to many charities."By Jove, thought poor Cyril, his cousin had evidently been a paragon."I see it will be difficult to fill his place," he said aloud.Twombley clapped him heartily on the back."Oh, you'll do all right, my
boy, and then, you know, you'll open the castle.The place has been like
a prison since Wilmersley's marriage.""No one regretted that as much as Lord Wilmersley," said the vicar."He
often spoke to me about it.But he had the choice between placing Lady
Wilmersley in an institution or turning the castle into an asylum.He
chose the latter alternative, although it was a great sacrifice.I have
rarely known so agreeable a man or one so suited to shine in any
company.It was unpardonable of Lady Upton to have allowed him to marry
without warning him of her granddaughter's condition.But he never had a
word of blame for her.""It was certainly a pity he did not have Lady Wilmersley put under
proper restraint.If he had only done so, he would be alive now," said
the coroner."So you believe that she murdered his lordship?"Who else had a motive for
doing it.My theory is that her ladyship wanted to escape, that his
lordship tried to prevent her, and so she shot him.Don't you agree with
me, Mr."It is impossible for me to express an opinion at present.I have not
had time to collect enough data," replied the detective pompously."He puts on such a lot of side, I believe he's an ass," thought Cyril,
heaving a sigh of relief."Their disappearance certainly provides a motive for the crime?""Yes, but only Lord and Lady Wilmersley knew the combination of the
safe.""All the servants are agreed as to that.Besides, a burglar would hardly
have overlooked the drawers of Lord Wilmersley's desk, which contained
about L300 in notes.""The thief may not have got as far as the library.Lady Wilmersley
occupied the blue room, I suppose."At the time of his marriage Lord Wilmersley ordered a suite
of rooms on the ground floor prepared for his bride's reception,"
replied the vicar.There was none when I was here
as a child.""No, it was built for Lady Wilmersley and adjoins her private
apartments," said the vicar."But all these rooms are on the ground floor.It must be an easy matter
to enter them.Consequently----"

"Easy!"interrupted Twombley; "not a bit of it!Crossing the hall they paused at a door."Now this door and that one
next to it, which is the door of Lady Wilmersley's bedroom," said the
coroner, "are the only ones in this wing which communicate with the rest
of the castle, and both were usually kept locked, not only at night, but
during the daytime.You will please notice, my lord," continued the
coroner, as they entered the library, "that both doors are fitted with
an ingenious device, by means of which they can be bolted and unbolted
from several seats in this room and from the divans in the
swimming-bath.Only in the early morning were the housemaids admitted to
these rooms; after that no one but Mustapha, Lord Wilmersley's Turkish
valet, ever crossed the threshold, unless with his lordship's express
permission.""You can look this room over later; I want you first to see the
swimming-bath."Cyril found himself in an immense and lofty hall, constructed entirely
of white marble and lighted by innumerable jewelled lamps, whose
multi-coloured lights were reflected in the transparent waters of a
pool, from the middle of which rose and splashed a fountain.Divans
covered with soft cushions and several small tables laden with pipes,
_houkahs_, cigarettes, etc., were placed at intervals around the sides
of the bath.On one of the tables, Cyril noticed that two coffee-cups
were still standing and by the side of a divan lay a long Turkish pipe.A profusion of tropical plants
imparted a heavy perfume to the air, which was warm and moist.Cyril
blinked his eyes; he felt as if he had suddenly been transported to the
palace of Aladdin.said Twombley, looking about him with evident
disfavour."To be shut in here for three years would be enough to drive
any one crazy, I say.""You will notice," said the coroner, "that the only entrance to the bath
is through the library or her ladyship's bedroom.No one could have let
himself down through the skylight, as it is protected by iron bars.""It was here and in the library that Lord Wilmersley spent his time, and
it was here in the right-hand corner of the bath that his body was
discovered this morning by one of the housemaids.The spot, as you see,
is exactly opposite her ladyship's door and that door was found open,
just as it stands at present.Now the housemaids swear that they always
found it closed and it is their belief that his lordship used to lock
her ladyship in her rooms before retiring to his own quarters for the
night.At all events they were never allowed to see her ladyship or
enter her apartments unless his lordship or her ladyship's maid was also
present.""At about what time is Lord Wilmersley supposed to have been killed?""Judging from the condition of the body, the doctor thinks that the
murder was committed between eleven and twelve P.M.," replied the
coroner; "and whoever fired the shot must have stood five or six feet
from Lord Wilmersley; in all probability, therefore, in the doorway of
the bedroom.Nothing has been touched, and you see
that neither here nor in the swimming-bath are there signs of a
struggle.""The door leading into the hall was found locked?""Then how did the house-man enter?"asked Cyril, pointing to a door to
his left."Into the sitting-room," replied the coroner, throwing it open."It was
here, I am told, that Lady Wilmersley usually spent the morning."It was a large, pleasant room panelled in white.A few faded pastels of
by-gone beauties ornamented the walls.A gilt cage in which slumbered a
canary hung in one of the windows.Cyril looked eagerly about him for
some traces of its late occupant's personality; but except for a piece
of unfinished needlework, lying on a small table near the fireplace,
there was nothing to betray the owner's taste or occupations."And there is no way out of this room except through the bedroom?"Judson thought of that and has tapped the walls.""These windows as well as those in the bedroom are fitted with heavy
iron bars."Who was the last person known to have seen Lord Wilmersley alive?"He carried coffee into the swimming-bath at a quarter past
nine, as was his daily custom."And he swears that in passing out through the library he heard
the bolt click behind him.""What sort of a person is Mustapha?""Lord Wilmersley brought him back with him when he returned from the
East.He had the greatest confidence in him," said the vicar."Do you know what his fellow-servants think of him," inquired Cyril,
addressing the coroner.I fancy he is not a favourite, but no one
has actually said anything against him.""How few of us are able to
overcome our inborn British suspicion of the foreigner!""See, here is his
lordship's desk.There are the drawers in which the L300 were found, and
yet any one could have picked that lock.""Into Lord Wilmersley's bedroom, the window of which is also provided
with iron bars.""And that room has no exit but this?"If the murderer came from outside, he must have got in
through one of these windows, which are the only ones in this wing which
have no protection, and this one was found ajar--but it may have been
used only as an exit, not as an entrance."Even a woman would have no difficulty in jumping to
the ground."But it couldn't have been a burglar," said the vicar, "for what object
could a thief have for destroying a portrait?""Oh, didn't you know that her ladyship's portrait was found cut into
shreds?""And a pair of Lady Wilmersley's scissors lay on the floor in front of
it," added the vicar."Let me see it," cried Cyril.Going to a corner of the room the vicar pulled aside a velvet curtain
behind which hung the wreck of a picture.The canvas was slashed from
top to bottom.No trace of the face was left; only a small piece of fair
hair was still distinguishable.Cyril grasped Twombley's arm.And his mysterious _protegee_ was
dark!"What--what was the colour of Lady Wilmersley's hair?""A very pale yellow," replied the coroner.For the convenience of my readers I give a diagram of Lord and Lady
Wilmersley's apartments.[Illustration:

THE DETECTIVE DETECTS


"A very pale yellow!"Every fact, every inference had seemed to prove beyond the shadow of a
doubt that his _protegee_ and Lady Wilmersley were one and the same
person.Was it possible that she could have worn a wig?No, for he
remembered that in lifting her veil, he had inadvertently pulled her
hair a little and had admired the way it grew on her temples."Why does the colour of her ladyship's hair interest you, my lord?"Cyril blushed with confusion as he realised that all three men were
watching him with evident astonishment.What a fool he was not to have
been able to conceal his surprise!However, as it was not his cousin's murderess he was hiding, he felt he
had nothing to fear from the detective, so ignoring him he turned to Mr.Twombley and said with a forced laugh:

"I must be losing my mind, for I distinctly remember hearing a friend of
mine rave about Lady Wilmersley's dark beauty."Rather a fishy
explanation, thought poor Cyril; but really his powers of invention were
exhausted.The latter was no longer looking at
him, but was contemplating his watch-chain with absorbed attention."Never had seen her,
I suppose; no one ever did, you know, except out driving.""It was either a silly joke or my memory is in a bad shape," said Cyril."Luckily it is a matter of no consequence.What is of vital importance,
however," he continued, turning to the detective, "is that her ladyship
should be secured immediately.No one is safe while she is still at
large.""It is unfortunate," replied the detective, "that no photograph of her
ladyship can be found, but we have telegraphed her description all over
the country.""What is her description, by the way?""Here it is, my lord," said Judson, handing Cyril a printed sheet."Height, 5 feet 3; weight, about 9 stone 2; hair, very fair, inclined to
be wavy; nose, straight; mouth, small; eyes, blue; face, oval," read
Cyril."Well, I suppose that will have to do, but of course that
description would fit half the women in England."Twombley, when you said just now that no one knew her, did you mean
that literally?""Nobody in the county did; I'm sure of that."Is it possible that even you never saw her?""Then so far as you know, the only person outside the castle she could
communicate with was the doctor."Why, the doctor who had charge of her case, of course," replied Cyril
impatiently."I never heard of her having a doctor.""Do you mean to say that Wilmersley kept her in confinement without
orders from a physician?"There must have been some one,"
faltered the vicar a trifle abashed."You never, however, inquired by what authority he kept his wife shut
up?""I never insulted Lord Wilmersley by questioning the wisdom of his
conduct or the integrity of his motives, and I repeat that there was
undoubtedly some physician in attendance on Lady Wilmersley, only I do
not happen to know who he is.""Well, I must clear this matter up at once."Who was her ladyship's physician?""My lady never 'ad one; leastways not till yesterday.""Yes, my lord, yesterday afternoon two gentlemen drove up in a fly and
one of them says 'is name is Dr.Brown and that 'e was expected, and 'is
lordship said as how I was to show them in here, and so I did.""You think they came to see her ladyship?""Yes, my lord, and at dinner her ladyship seemed very much upset.She
didn't eat a morsel, though 'is lordship urged 'er ever so.""But why should a doctor's visit upset her ladyship?"The butler pursed his lips and looked mysterious."I can't say, my
lord.""Nonsense, you've some idea in your head."Well, my lord, me and Charles, we thought as she was afraid they were
going to lock 'er up."exclaimed the vicar, clasping his
hands."But, sir, her ladyship wasn't crazy!They all say so, but it isn't
true.Me and Charles 'ave watched 'er at table day in and day out and
we're willing to swear that she isn't any more crazy than--than me!Please excuse the liberty, but I never thought 'er ladyship was treated
right, I never did.""Why, you told me yourself that his lordship was devoted to her.""So 'e was, my lord, so 'e was.""If her ladyship is not insane, why do you think his lordship kept her a
prisoner here?""Well, my lord, some people 'ave thought that it was jealousy as made
him do it.""That," exclaimed the vicar, "is a vile calumny, which I have done my
best to refute.""So jealousy was the motive generally ascribed to my cousin's treatment
of his wife?""Not generally, far from it; but I regret to say that there are people
who professed to believe it.""Did her ladyship have a nurse?"asked Cyril, addressing the butler."No, my lord, only a maid."Valdriguez is a very respectable person, my lord.""Perhaps, my lord, I don't pronounce it just right."Yes, my lord, she was here first in the time of Lord Wilmersley's
mother, and 'is lordship brought 'er back again when he returned from
'is 'oneymoon.Lady Wilmersley never left these rooms without 'aving
either 'is lordship, Mustapha, or Valdriguez with 'er.""Very good, Douglas, you can go now."cried Cyril when the door closed behind the
butler."Here in civilised England a poor young creature is kept in
confinement with a Spanish woman and a Turk to watch over her, and no
one thinks of demanding an investigation!Never liked the man myself--confess it now--but I
didn't know anything against him."I am deeply pained by your attitude to your unfortunate cousin, who
paid with his life for his devotion to an afflicted woman.I feel it my
duty to say that your suspicions are unworthy of you.I must go now; I
have some parochial duties to attend to."And with scant ceremony the
vicar stalked out of the room.Can't be late for
dinner--wife, you know.Why don't you come with me--gloomy
here--delighted to put you up.It's awfully good of you
to suggest it, though.""Not at all; sorry you won't come.See you at the inquest," said
Twombley as he took his departure followed by the coroner.Before him
on the desk lay his cousin's blotter.Its white surface still bore the
impress of the latter's thick, sprawling handwriting.That chair not so
many hours ago had held his unwieldy form.The murdered man's presence
seemed to permeate the room.The heavy,
perfume-laden air stifled him.He could hear nothing but
the tumultuous beating of his own heart.Yet he was sure, warned by some
mysterious instinct, that he was not alone.He longed to move, but terror riveted him to the spot.A vision of his
cousin's baleful eyes rose before him with horrible vividness.He could
feel their vindictive glare scorching him.No, he must face the--thing--come what might.Throwing back his
head defiantly, he wheeled around--the detective was at his elbow!Cyril
gave a gasp of relief and wiped the tell-tale perspiration from his
forehead.What a shocking state
his nerves were in!"Can you spare me a few minutes, my lord?"Whenever the detective spoke,
Cyril had the curious impression as of a voice issuing from a fog.So
grey, so effaced, so absolutely characterless was the man's exterior!His voice, on the other hand, was excessively individual.There lurked
in it a suggestion of assertiveness, of aggressiveness even.Cyril was
conscious of a sudden dread of this strong, insistent personality, lying
as it were at ambush within that envelope of a body, that envelope which
he felt he could never penetrate, which gave no indication whether it
concealed a friend or enemy, a saint or villain."I shall not detain you long," Judson added, as Cyril did not answer
immediately."Come into the drawing-room," said Cyril, leading the way there.Thank God, he could breathe freely once more, thought Cyril, as he flung
himself into the comfortable depths of a chintz-covered sofa.How
delightfully wholesome and commonplace was this room!The air, a trifle
chill, notwithstanding the coal fire burning on the hearth, was like
balm to his fevered senses.He no longer understood the terror which had so lately possessed him.How could he ever have dignified this remarkably
unremarkable little man with his pompous manner into a mysterious and
possibly hostile force."Sit down, Judson," said Cyril carelessly."My lord, am I not right in supposing that I am unknown to you?Let me tell you then, my lord, that I am the
receptacle of the secrets of most, if not all, of the aristocracy."I'll take good care, he thought, that mine don't
swell the number."That being the case, it is clear that my reputation for discretion is
unassailable.You see the force of that argument, my lord?""Anything, therefore, which I may discover during the course of this
investigation, you may rest assured will be kept absolutely secret.""You can, therefore, confide in me without fear,"
continued the detective.Cyril was surprised and a little startled."What makes you think I have anything to confide?""It is quite obvious, my lord, that you are holding something
back--something which would explain your attitude towards Lady
Wilmersley.""I don't follow you," replied Cyril, on his guard."You have given every one to understand that you have never seen her
ladyship.You take up a stranger's cause very warmly, my lord.""I trust I shall always espouse the cause of every persecuted woman.""But how are you sure that she was persecuted?Every one praises his
lordship's devotion to her.He gave her everything she could wish for
except liberty.If she was insane, his conduct deserves great praise.""But you yourself urged me to secure her as soon as possible because you
were afraid she might do further harm," Judson reminded him."That was before I heard Douglas's testimony.He has seen her daily for
three years and swears she is sane.""And the opinion of an ignorant servant is sufficient to make you
condemn his lordship without further proof?""If Lady Wilmersley is perfectly sane, it seems to me incredible that
she did not manage to escape years ago.A note dropped out of her
carriage would have brought the whole countryside to her rescue.Why,
she had only to appeal to this very same butler, who is convinced of her
sanity, and Lord Wilmersley could not have prevented her from leaving
the castle."That is true," acknowledged Cyril, "but her spirit may have been
broken."We hear only of his lordship's almost
excessive devotion.No, my lord, I can't help thinking that you are
judging both Lord and Lady Wilmersley by facts of which I am ignorant."Cyril did not know what to answer.He had at first championed Lady
Wilmersley because he had believed her to be his _protegee_, but now
that it had been proved that she was not, why was he still convinced
that she had in some way been a victim of her husband's cruelty?He had
to acknowledge that beyond a vague distrust of his cousin he had not
only no adequate reason, but no reason at all, for his suspicions."You are mistaken," he said at last; "I am withholding nothing that
could in any way assist you to unravel this mystery.I confess I neither
liked nor trusted my cousin.I know no more than you do of his treatment of her
ladyship.But doesn't the choice of a Turk and a Spaniard as attendants
on Lady Wilmersley seem to you open to criticism?"Lord
Wilmersley had spent the greater part of his life with Turks and
Spaniards.It therefore seems to me quite natural that when it came to
selecting guardians for her ladyship, he should have chosen a man and a
woman he had presumably known for some years, whose worth he had proved,
whose fidelity he could rely on.""That sounds plausible," agreed Cyril; "still I can't help thinking it
very peculiar, to say the least, that Lady Wilmersley was not under a
doctor's care.""Her ladyship may have been too unbalanced to mingle with people, and
yet not in a condition to require medical attention."True, and yet I have a feeling that Douglas was right, when he assured
us that her ladyship is not insane.You discredit his testimony on the
ground that he is an ignorant man.But if a man of sound common-sense
has the opportunity of observing a woman daily during three years, it
seems to me that his opinion cannot be lightly ignored.Well, I did, and as I said before, he was a man who inspired
me with the profoundest distrust, although I cannot cite one fact to
justify my aversion.I cannot believe that he ever sacrificed himself
for any one and am much more inclined to credit Douglas's suggestion
that it was jealousy which led him to keep her ladyship in such strict
seclusion.But why waste our time in idle conjectures when it is so easy
to find out the truth?Those two doctors who saw her yesterday must be
found.If they are men of good reputation, of course I shall accept
their report as final.""Very good, my lord, I will at once have an advertisement inserted in
all the papers asking them to communicate with us.If that does not
fetch them, I shall employ other means of tracing them.""Has Lady Upton, her ladyship's grandmother, been heard from?""She wired this morning asking for further particulars.Twombley
answered her, I believe."A slight pause ensued during which Judson watched Cyril as if expecting
him to speak."And you have still nothing to say to me, my lord?""No, what else should I have to say?""That is, of course, for you to judge, my lord."Was it possible that the man dared
to doubt his word?Dared to disbelieve his positive assertion that he
knew nothing whatsoever about the murder?The damnable--suddenly he
remembered!Remembered the lies he had been so glibly telling all day.His ignominy was probably
already stamped on his face."I have nothing more to say," replied Cyril in a strangely meek voice."That being the case, I'd better be off," said Judson, rising slowly
from his chair."I can't quite tell, my lord.It is my intention to vanish, so to
speak."I work best in the dark; but you will hear from me as
soon as I have something definite to report.""I hope you will be successful," said Cyril."Thank you; I've never failed so far in anything I have undertaken.I
must, however, warn you, my lord, that investigations sometimes lead to
conclusions which no one could have foreseen when they were started.I
always make a point of reminding my employers of this possibility."What the devil was the man driving at, thought Cyril; did he suspect him
by any chance?"I shall never quarrel with you for discovering the truth," said Cyril,
drawing himself up to his full height and glaring fiercely down at the
little grey man.Then, turning abruptly on his heel he stalked
indignantly out of the room, slamming the door behind him.CHAPTER VI

THE MYSTERIOUS MAID


"My lord.""Sorry to disturb you, but this 'as just come," said Peter, holding out
a tray on which lay an opened telegram.His expression was so tragic
that Cyril started up and seized the message.It was addressed to Peter Thompkins, Geralton Castle, Newhaven, and
read: "Change for the better.Signed,
"Stuart-Smith.""What are you
pulling such a long face for?""You call it good news that you haven't got rid of that young woman
yet?""This Stuart-Smith, whoever he may be, who is
wiring you to come to 'er, thinks she's your wife, doesn't he?That was
bad enough when you were just Mr.Crichton, but now it's just hawful.A
Lady Wilmersley can't be hid as a Mrs.Crichton could, begging your
pardon.Oh, it'll all come out, so it will, and you'll be 'ad up for
bigamy, like as not!"As soon as the young lady recovers, she will join her friends
and no one will be any the wiser.""Well, my lord, let's 'ope so!But what answer am I to send to this
telegram?"It would certainly be inconvenient," agreed his master."If you did, you'd be followed, my lord."The police can't be such fools as all that.""'Tisn't the police, my lord.The
castle is full of them; they're nosing about heverywhere; there's not
one of us as hasn't been pestered with the fellows.It's what you are
like, what are you doing, what 'ave you done, and a lot more foolish
questions hever since we set foot here yesterday afternoon.And 'we'll
pay you well,' they say.Of course, I've not opened my mouth to them,
but they're that persistent, they'll follow you to the end of the earth
if you should leave the castle unexpectedly."This was a complication that had not occurred to Cyril, and yet he felt
he ought to have foreseen it.Suddenly Stuart-Smith's stern face and uncompromising upper
lip rose vividly before him.Even if he wished to do so, the doctor
would never allow him to ignore his supposed wife.If he did not answer
his summons in person, Smith would certainly put the worst
interpretation on his absence.He would argue that only a brute would
neglect a wife who was lying seriously ill and the fact that the girl
had been flogged could also be remembered against him.Smith was
capable of taking drastic measures to force him into performing what he
considered the latter's obvious duty.Cyril did not know what to do.If he
went, he would surely be followed and the girl's existence and
hiding-place discovered.That would be fatal not only to him but to her,
for she had feared detection above all things--why, he could not even
surmise--he no longer even cared; but he had promised to protect her and
meant to do so.On the other hand, if he did not go, he ran the risk of the doctor's
publishing the girl's whereabouts.Still, it was by no means certain he
would do so, and if he wrote Smith a diplomatic letter, he might succeed
in persuading him that it was best for the girl if he stayed away a day
longer.Hastily throwing on a
dressing-gown, he sat down at the desk.It was a difficult letter to
write and he destroyed many sheets before he was finally satisfied.This
was the result of his efforts:

     "DEAR DR.STUART-SMITH:

     "I am infinitely relieved that your patient is better.As you
     addressed your wire here, I gather that you know of the tragic
     occurrence, which has kept me from her side.It is impossible
     for me to leave before the funeral without explaining my
     mission, and this I am very loath to do, as I am more than ever
     anxious to keep her malady a secret.Monet has always
     believed in the possibility of a cure, and as long as there is
     a chance of that, I am sure you will agree with me that I ought
     to make every sacrifice to protect her from gossip.If she did
     recover and her illness became known, it would greatly handicap
     her in her new life.Having to stay away from her would be even
     more distressing to me than it is if I could flatter myself
     that my presence would have a good effect upon her.I am sure,
     however, that such would not be the case."I shall return to London late to-morrow afternoon and will
     telephone you immediately on my arrival."I am sending this by a trustworthy servant, who will bring me
     your answer.I am most anxious to hear what you think of your
     patient's condition, mentally as well as physically.I am sure
     she could not be in better hands."No, he
wished to inspire confidence; his own name would be better.So with a
firm hand he wrote "Wilmersley."It was the first time he had used his new signature and he heartily
wished it had not been appended to such a document."Now, Peter," he said, "you must take the next train to London and carry
this to Dr.If he is not at the nursing home, telephone to
his house and find out where he is.The letter must be delivered as soon
as possible and you are to wait for a reply.If the doctor asks you any
questions, answer as briefly as possible.In order to avoid comment you
had better let it be known that you are going up to town to do some
shopping for me.I want you also to call at the
lodgings and tell them we shall return to-morrow.If you are followed,
which I can't believe you will be, this will allay suspicion.Take a
taxi and get back as soon as possible.You may mention to the doctor that I am extremely anxious about Mrs."Throw the sheets I have scribbled on into the fire and the blotting
paper as well," ordered Cyril.He felt rather proud of having thought of this detail, but with
detectives and pressmen prowling around he must run no risks.It was
with a very perturbed mind that Cyril finally went down to breakfast.Eversley would like to speak to you, my lord, as soon as
convenient," said Douglas as his master rose from the table.Cyril
fancied he detected a gleam of suppressed excitement in the butler's
eye."I'll see her at once," Cyril answered.A stout, respectable-looking woman hesitated in the doorway.I've
never forgotten you or your doughnuts."The troubled face broke into a pleased smile as the woman dropped a
courtesy."It's very kind of you to remember them, my lord, very kind indeed, and
glad I am to see you again.""This is a terrible
business, my lord."Valdriguez has said for months and months that
something like this was sure to happen some day.""Do you mean to say that she prophesied that her ladyship would kill his
lordship?""Yes, my lord, indeed she did!It made me feel that queer when it really
'appened.""But begging your pardon, my lord, there is something special as made me
ask to speak to you--something I thought you ought to know immediately."Cyril had felt that some new trouble was brewing."One of the servants has disappeared, my lord.""Perhaps I'm making too much of it, but this murder has that upset me
that I'm afraid of my own shadow and I says to myself, says I: 'Don't
wait; go and tell his lordship at once and he'll know whether it is
important or not.'""Priscilla Prentice and perhaps she hasn't disappeared at all.This is
how it is: The day before yesterday----"

"The day of the murder?"Prentice came to me and asked if she could go to Newhaven
to see a cousin she has there.The cousin is ill--leastways so she told
me--and she wanted as a great favour to be allowed to spend the night
with her, and she promised to come back by the carrier early next
morning.It seemed all right, so I gave her permission and off she goes.Then yesterday this dreadful thing happened and Prentice went clean out
of my head.I never thought of her again till breakfast this morning
when Mr.Douglas says to me: 'Why, wherever is Miss Prentice?'You could
'ave knocked me down with a feather, I was that taken aback!So I says,
'Whatever can 'ave happened to her?'""When she heard of the murder, she may have taken fright.She may be
waiting to return to the castle till the inquest and funeral are over,"
suggested Cyril."Then she ought at least to have sent word.Besides she should have got
back before she could have heard of the murder.""You had better send to the cousin's and find out if she is there.She
may have been taken ill and had nobody to send a message by.""We none of us know whereabouts this cousin lives, my lord.""But we don't know her name, my lord."How long has this girl been at the
castle?"Valdriguez's eyes are not what they
were and so she 'ad to have somebody to do the mending.I must say
foreigners sew beautifully, so it was some time before I could get any
one whose work suited Mrs.She's very young, and this is her first
place.But she was excellently recommended by Mr.Vaughan, vicar of
Plumtree, who wrote that she was a most respectable girl and that he
could vouch for her character."I'm glad you think so, my lord.Such a nice young woman
she seemed, so 'ard-working and conscientious; one who kept 'erself to
'erself; never a word with the men--never, though she is so pretty.""Oh, she is pretty, is she?"A faint but horrible suspicion flashed
through Cyril's mind."Yes, my lord, as pretty as a picture.""She is tall and slight with dark hair and blue eyes," Mrs.She was evidently taken aback at her master's interest in a
servant's appearance and a certain reserve crept into her voice."Could she--would it be possible to mistake her for a lady?""Well, my lord, it's strange you should ask that, for Douglas, he always
has said, 'Mark my words, Miss Prentice isn't what she seems,' and I
must say she is very superior, very."It wasn't, it couldn't be possible, thought Cyril; and yet----

"Did she see much of her ladyship?"Valdriguez, seeing as what she was such a quiet girl, has
allowed her to put the things she has mended back into her ladyship's
room, and I know her ladyship has spoken to her, but how often she has
done so I couldn't really say."Did she seem much interested in her ladyship?"If we were talking about her ladyship, she would
always stay and listen.Once, when one of the housemaids 'ad said
something about her being crazy, I think, Prentice got quite excited,
and when Mrs.Valdriguez had left the room, she said to me, 'I don't
believe there is anything the matter with her ladyship; I think it just
cruel the way she is kept locked up!'Begging your pardon, my lord,
those were her very words.She made me promise not to repeat what she
had said--least of all to Mrs.Valdriguez, and I never have, not till
this minute.""Did she ever suggest that she would like to help her ladyship to
escape?"Eversley, staring at her master in
astonishment."That's just what she did do, just once--oh, you don't
think she did it!And yet that's what they're all saying----"

"Is anything missing from her room?""I can't say, my lord; her trunk is locked and she took a small bag with
her.But there are things in the drawers and a skirt and a pair of shoes
in the wardrobe.""From the appearance of the room, therefore, you should judge that she
intended to return?""Ye-es, my lord--and yet I must say, I was surprised to see so few
things about, and the skirt and shoes were very shabby.""I suppose that by this time every one knows the girl is missing?""The upper servants do, and the detective was after me to tell him all
about her, but I wouldn't say a word till I had asked what your
lordship's wishes are.""I thought Judson had left the castle?""So he has, my lord; this is the man from Scotland Yard.He was 'ere before Judson, but he had left the castle before you
arrived."Impossible even to attempt, to keep her disappearance a secret, thought
Cyril.After all, perhaps she was not his _protegee_.He was always
jumping at erroneous conclusions, and a description is so misleading.On
the other hand, the combination of black hair and blue eyes was a most
unusual one.Besides, it was already sufficiently remarkable that two
young and beautiful women had fled from Newhaven on the same day (beauty
being alas such a rarity!), but that three should have done so was
well-nigh incredible.But could even the most superior of upper servants
possess that air of breeding which was one of the girl's most noticeable
attributes.It was, of course, within the bounds of possibility that
this maid was well-born and simply forced by poverty into a menial
position.One thing was certain--if his _protegee_ was Priscilla
Prentice, then this girl, in spite of her humble occupation, was a lady,
and consequently more than ever in need of his protection and respect.Well, assuming that it was Prentice he had rescued, what part had she
played in the tragedy?She must have been
present at the murder, but even in that case, why did she not realise
that Lady Wilmersley's unbalanced condition would prevent suspicion from
falling on any one else?Cyril sat weighing the _pros and cons_ of one theory after another,
completely oblivious of his housekeeper's presence.Douglas, entering, discreetly interrupted his cogitations:

"The inquest is about to begin, my lord."CHAPTER VII

THE INQUEST


On entering the hall Cyril found that a seat on the right hand of the
coroner had been reserved for him, but he chose a secluded corner from
which he could watch the proceedings unobserved.Tinker sat a tall, imposing-looking man, who, on
inquiry, proved to be Inspector Griggs.The first part of the inquest developed nothing new.It was only when
Mustapha stepped forward that Cyril's interest revived and he forgot the
problem of his _protegee's_ identity.The Turk, with the exception of a red fez, was dressed as a European,
but his swarthy skin, large, beak-like nose, and deep, sombre eyes, in
which brooded the mystery of the East, proclaimed his nationality.Cyril tried in vain to form some estimate of the man's character, to
probe the depths of those fathomless eyes, but ignorant as he was of the
Oriental, he found it impossible to differentiate between Mustapha's
racial and individual characteristics.That he was full of infinite
possibilities was evident--even his calmness was suggestive of potential
passion.A man to be watched, decided Cyril.Mustapha gave his testimony in a low, clear voice, and although he spoke
with a strong foreign accent, his English was purer than that of his
fellow servants.That he had nothing to do with the murder seemed from the first
conclusively proved.Several of the servants had seen him enter his
room, which adjoined that of the butler, at about half-past nine--that
is to say, an hour and a half before Lord Wilmersley's death could, in
the doctor's opinion, have taken place--and Douglas on cross--reiterated
his conviction that Mustapha could not have left his room without his
having heard him do so, as he, Douglas, was a very light sleeper.In answer to questions from the coroner, Mustapha told how he had
entered the late Lord Wilmersley's service some fifteen years
previously, at which time his master owned a house on the outskirts of
Constantinople.As he dressed as a Mussulman and consorted entirely with
the natives, Mustapha did not know that he was a foreigner till his
master informed him of the fact just before leaving Turkey.When questioned as to Lady Wilmersley, he was rather non-committal.No,
he had never believed her to be dangerous.--Had she seemed happy?No,
she cried often.--Did his lordship ever ill-treat her?His lordship was very patient with her tears.--Did he know how she
could have obtained a pistol?Yes, there was one concealed on his
master's desk.He had discovered that it was missing.--How could a
pistol lie concealed _on_ a desk?It was hidden inside an ancient steel
gauntlet, ostensibly used as a paperweight.Mustapha had found it one
day quite accidentally.--Did he tell his lordship of his discovery?His master was always afraid of being spied upon.--Why?He did not
know.--Did Mustapha know of any enemy of his lordship who was likely to
have sought such a revenge?His master's enemies were not in
England.--Then his lordship had enemies?As all men have, so had
he.--But he had no special enemy?An enemy is an enemy, but his master's
enemies were not near.--How could he be so sure of that?From his, Mustapha's friends.--Did his
lordship fear his enemies would follow him to England?At first,
perhaps, but not lately.--If his lordship's enemies had found him, would
they have been likely to kill him?The heart of man is
very evil.--But he knew no one who could have done this thing?No
one.--Did he believe his mistress had done it?Mustapha hesitated for
the first time."Do you believe her ladyship killed your master--Yes or No?""It is not for me to say," replied Mustapha with unruffled dignity.The coroner, feeling himself rebuked, dismissed the man with a hurried
"That will do."She was a tall, thin woman between fifty and sixty.Her black hair,
freely sprinkled with silver, was drawn into a tight knot at the back of
her small head.Her pale, haggard face, with its finely-chiselled nose,
thin-lipped mouth, and slightly-retreating chin, was almost beautified
by her large, sunken eyes, which still glowed with extraordinary
brilliancy.Her black dress was austere in its simplicity and she wore
no ornament except a small gold cross suspended on her bosom.She held her hands tightly clasped in
front of her, and her lips twitched from time to time.She spoke so low
that Cyril had to lean forward to catch her answers, but her English was
perfectly fluent.It was chiefly her accent and intonation which
betrayed her foreign birth."You lived here in the time of the late Lady Wilmersley, did you not?""When did you leave here, and why?""I left when her ladyship died.""How did you happen to enter the present Lady Wilmersley's service?""Lord Wilmersley sent for me when he was on his wedding journey.""Had you seen him after you left Geralton?""Do you know whether his lordship had any enemies?""Those that he had are either dead or have forgiven," Valdriguez
answered, and as she did so, she fingered the cross on her breast."So that you can think of no one likely to have resorted to such a
terrible revenge?""On the night of the murder you did not assist her ladyship to undress,
so I understand?"From the time her ladyship left her room to go to dinner I
never saw her again till the following morning."She cried and
begged me to help her to escape."A murmur of excitement ran through the hall."I told her that she was his lordship's lawful wife; that she had vowed
before God to honour and obey him in all things.""Had she ever made an attempt to escape?""Did she ever give you any reason for wishing to do so?""She told me that his lordship threatened to shut her up in a lunatic
asylum, but I assured her he would never do so."You consider that he was very devoted to her?""He loved her as I have never before known a man love a woman," she
answered, with suppressed vehemence."Why then did he send for the doctors to commit her to an institution?"At this point of the interrogation Cyril scribbled a few words, which he
gave to one of the footmen to carry to the coroner.When the latter had
read them, he asked:

"Did you consider her ladyship a dangerous lunatic?""Why, then, did you prophesy that she would kill your master?"The woman trembled slightly and her hand again sought the cross."I--I believed Lord Wilmersley's time had come, but I knew not how he
would die.I did not know that she would be the instrument--only I
feared it.""Why did you think his lordship's days were numbered?""Sir, if I were to tell you my reasons, you would say that they were not
reasons.You would call them superstitions and me a foolish old woman.I
believe what I believe, and you, what you have been taught.Suffice it, sir, that my reasons for believing that his lordship
would die soon are not such as would appeal to your common-sense.""H'm, well--I confess that signs and omens are not much in my line, but
I must really insist upon your giving some explanation as to why you
feared that your mistress would murder Lord Wilmersley."The woman's lips twitched convulsively and her eyes glowed with sombre
fire."Because--if you will know it--he loved her more than was natural--he
loved her more than his God; and the Lord God is a jealous God.""And this is really your only reason for your extraordinary
supposition?""For me it is enough," she replied.said the coroner, regarding the woman
intently."How did you pass the evening of the murder?"I had a headache and went early to bed.""I suppose somebody saw you after you left Lady Wilmersley's room who
can support your statement?"I do not remember seeing any one," answered Valdriguez,
throwing her head back and looking a little defiantly at Mr."However, there is no
reason to doubt your word--as yet," he added.The coroner questioned her exhaustively
as to the missing Priscilla Prentice.He seemed especially anxious to
know whether the girl had owned a bicycle.She had not.--Did she know
how to ride one?Eversley had seen her try one belonging to
the under-housemaid.--Did many of the servants own bicycles?Yes.--Had
one of them been taken?On further inquiry, however, it was found that all the machines were
accounted for.It had not occurred to Cyril to speculate as to how, if Prentice had
really aided her mistress to escape, she had been able to cover the nine
miles which separated the castle from Newhaven.Eighteen miles in one
evening on foot!Not perhaps an impossible feat, but very nearly so,
especially as on her way back she would have been handicapped by Lady
Wilmersley, a delicate woman, quite unaccustomed--at all events during
the last three years--to any form of exercise.It was evident, however, that this difficulty had not escaped the
coroner, for all the servants and more especially the gardeners
and under-gardeners were asked if they had seen in any of the
less-frequented paths traces of a carriage or bicycle.But no one had
seen or heard anything suspicious.The head gardener and his wife, who lived at the Lodge, swore that the
tall, iron gates had been locked at half-past nine, and that they had
heard no vehicle pass on the highroad during the night.At this point in the proceedings whispering was audible in the back of
the hall.The coroner paused to see what was the matter.A moment later
Douglas stepped up to him and said something in a low voice.A middle-aged woman, very red in the face, came reluctantly forward.Willis, I hear you have something to tell me?""Indeed no, sir," exclaimed the woman, picking nervously at her gloves.Only when I 'eard you asking about carriages in
the night, I says to Mrs.Jones--well, one passed, I know that.Leastways, it didn't exactly pass; it stayed.""It wasn't a carriage and it stayed?Can't you explain yourself more
clearly, Mrs.This isn't a conundrum, is it?""It was a car, a motor-car," stammered the woman."I couldn't say exactly, but not far from our cottage.""On the 'ighroad near the long lane.""Your husband is one of the
gardeners here, isn't he?""So there is doubtless a path connecting your cottage with the castle
grounds?""About how far from your cottage was the car?""I didn't see it, sir; I just 'eard it; but it wasn't far, that I know,"
reiterated the woman."Did you hear any one pass through your garden?""Could they have done so without your hearing them?""Was the car going to or coming from Newhaven?""Then it must have stopped at the foot of the long lane.""Yes, sir; that's just about where I thought it was.""Is there a path connecting Long Lane with the highroad?""What time was it when you heard the car?"I wouldn't like to swear, sir, but I think it was between eleven and
twelve.""No, sir, 'e was fast asleep, but I wasn't feeling very well, so I had
got up thinking I'd make myself a cup of tea, and just then I 'eard a
car come whizzing along, and then there was a bang.Oh, says I, they've
burst their wheel, that's what they've done, me knowing about cars.I
know it takes a bit of mending, a wheel does, so I wasn't surprised when
I 'eard no more of them for a time--and I 'ad just about forgotten all
about them, so I had, when I 'ears them move off.""No, sir, I'm sure of that.""Well, sir"--the woman fidgeted uneasily, "I thought--but I shouldn't
like to swear to it--not on the Bible--but I fancied I 'eard a cry.""I really couldn't say--and perhaps what I 'eard was not a cry at
all----"

"Well, well--this is most important.A motor-car that is driven at
half-past eleven at night to the foot of a lane which leads nowhere but
to the castle grounds, and then returns in the direction it came
from--very extraordinary--very.We must look into this," exclaimed the
coroner.CHAPTER VIII

LADY UPTON


     Dr.Peter Thompkins, Geralton Castle,
     Newhaven."DEAR LORD WILMERSLEY:

     "Lady Wilmersley showed signs of returning consciousness at
     half-past five yesterday afternoon.I was at once sent for, but
     when I arrived she had fallen asleep.She woke again at nine
     o'clock and this time asked where she was.She spoke
     indistinctly and did not seem to comprehend what the nurse said
     to her.When I reached the patient, I found her sitting up in
     bed.Her pulse was irregular; her temperature, subnormal.I am
     glad to be able to assure you that Lady Wilmersley is at
     present perfectly rational.She is, however, suffering from
     hysterical amnesia complicated by aphasia, but I trust this is
     only a temporary affection.At first she hesitated over the
     simplest words, but before I left she could talk with tolerable
     fluency."I asked Lady Wilmersley whether she wished to see you.She has
     not only forgotten that she has a husband but has no very clear
     idea as to what a husband is.In fact, she appears to have
     preserved no precise impression of anything.She did not even
     remember her own name.When I told it to her, she said it
     sounded familiar, only that she did not associate it with
     herself.Of you personally she has no recollection, although I
     described you as accurately as I could.However, as your name
     is the only thing she even dimly recalls, I hope that when you
     see her, you will be able to help her bridge the gulf which
     separates her from the past."She seemed distressed at her condition, so I told her that she
     had been ill and that it was not uncommon for convalescents to
     suffer temporarily from loss of memory.When I left her, she
     was perfectly calm."She slept well last night, and this morning she has no
     difficulty in expressing herself, but I do not allow her to
     talk much as she is still weak."I quite understand the delicacy of your position and
     sympathise with you most deeply.Although I am anxious to try
     what effect your presence will have on Lady Wilmersley, the
     experiment can be safely postponed till to-morrow afternoon."I trust the inquest will clear up the mystery which surrounds
     the late Lord Wilmersley's death."Believe me,
    "Sincerely yours,
    "A.Cyril stared at the letter aghast.If the girl herself had forgotten her
identity, how could he hope to find out the truth?He did not even dare
to instigate a secret inquiry--certainly not till the Geralton mystery
had been cleared up.Cyril passed a sleepless night and the next morning found him still
undecided as to what course to pursue.It was, therefore, a pale face
and a preoccupied mien that he presented to the inspection of the
county, which had assembled in force to attend his cousin's funeral.Never in the memory of man had such an exciting event taken place and
the great hall in which the catafalque had been erected was thronged
with men of all ages and conditions.In the state drawing-room Cyril stood and received the condolences and
faced the curiosity of the county magnates.The ordeal was almost over, when the door was again thrown open and the
butler announced, "Lady Upton."Leaning heavily on a gold-headed cane Lady Upton advanced majestically
into the room.A sudden hush succeeded her entrance; every eye was riveted upon her.She seemed, however, superbly indifferent to the curiosity she aroused,
and one felt, somehow, that she was not only indifferent but
contemptuous.She was a tall woman, taller, although she stooped a little, than most
of the men present.Notwithstanding her great age, she gave the
impression of extraordinary vigour.Her face was long and narrow, with a
stern, hawk-like nose, a straight, uncompromising mouth, and a
protruding chin.Her scanty, white hair was drawn tightly back from her
high forehead; a deep furrow separated her bushy, grey eyebrows and gave
an added fierceness to her small, steel-coloured eyes.An antiquated
bonnet perched perilously on the back of her head; her dress was quite
obviously shabby; and yet no one could for a moment have mistaken her
for anything but a truly great lady.Disregarding Cyril's outstretched hand, she deliberately raised her
lorgnette and looked at him for a moment in silence.You are a Crichton at any rate," she said at last.Having given
vent to this ambiguous remark, she waved her glasses, as if to sweep
away the rest of the company, and continued: "I wish to speak to you
alone."Her voice was deep and harsh and she made no effort to lower it."So this was Anita Wilmersley's grandmother."It is almost time for the funeral to start," he said aloud and he tried
to convey by his manner that he, at any rate, had no intention of
allowing her to ride rough-shod over him."I know," she snapped, "so hurry, please.Cyril heard them
murmur and, such was the force of the old lady's personality, that
youths and grey beards jostled each other in their anxiety to get out of
the room as quickly as possible."Get me a chair," commanded Lady Upton.I want to sit
down, not lie down."With her stick she indicated a high, straight-backed chair, which had
been relegated to a corner.Having seated herself, she took a pair of spectacles out of her reticule
and proceeded to wipe them in a most leisurely manner.Finally, her task completed to her own satisfaction, she adjusted her
glasses and crossed her hands over the top of her cane."No news of my granddaughter, I suppose," she demanded."Anita is a fool, but I am certain--absolutely certain, mind you--that
she did not kill that precious husband of hers, though I don't doubt he
richly deserved it.""I am surprised that you of all people should speak of my cousin in that
tone," said Cyril and he looked at her meaningly."Of course, you believe what every one believes, that I forced Ann into
that marriage.I merely pointed out to her that she
could not do better than take him.She had not a penny to her name and
after my death would have been left totally unprovided for.I have only
my dower, as you know.""But, how could you have allowed a girl whose mind was affected to
marry?"You don't believe that nonsense, do you?Newspaper
twaddle, that is all that amounts to.""I beg your pardon, Arthur himself gave out that her condition was such
that she was unable to see any one."He wrote to me quite frequently and never hinted at such a
thing.""Nevertheless I assure you that is the case.""Then he is a greater blackguard than I took him to be----"

"But did you not know that he kept her practically a prisoner here?""And she never complained to you of his treatment of her?""I once got a hysterical letter from her begging me to let her come back
to me, but as the only reason she gave for wishing to leave her husband
was that he was personally distasteful to her, I wrote back that as she
had made her bed, she must lie on it.""And even after that appeal you never made an attempt to see Anita and
find out for yourself how Arthur was treating her?""I am not accustomed to being cross-questioned, Lord Wilmersley.I am
accountable to no one but my God for what I have done or failed to do.She takes after her father, whom my daughter married
without my consent.When she was left an orphan, I took charge of her
and did my duty by her; but I never pretended that I was not glad when
she married and, as she did so of her own free-will, I cannot see that
her future life was any concern of mine."This proud, hard, selfish
old woman had evidently never ceased to visit her resentment of her
daughter's marriage on the child of that marriage.He could easily
picture the loveless and miserable existence poor Anita must have led.Was it surprising that she should have taken the first chance that was
offered her of escaping from her grandmother's thraldom?She had
probably been too ignorant to realise what sort of a man Arthur
Wilmersley really was and too innocent to know what she was pledging
herself to."I have come here to-day," continued Lady Upton, "because I considered
it seemly that my granddaughter's only relative should put in an
appearance at the funeral and also because I wanted you to tell me
exactly what grounds the police have for suspecting Anita."Cyril related as succinctly as possible everything which had so far come
to light.He, however, carefully omitted to mention his meeting with the
girl on the train.As the latter could not be Anita Wilmersley, he felt
that he was not called upon to inform Lady Upton of this episode.exclaimed Lady Upton, when he had finished."All I can say is,
that Anita is quite incapable of firing a pistol at any one, even if it
were thrust into her hand.You may not believe me, but that is because
you don't know her.Unless
Arthur had frightened her out of her wits, she would never have screwed
up courage to leave him, and it would be just like her to crawl away in
the night instead of walking out of the front door like a sensible
person.I have no patience with such a spineless creature!You men,
however, consider it an engaging feminine attribute for a woman to have
neither character nor sense!"Lady Upton snorted contemptuously and
glared at Cyril as if she held him personally responsible for the bad
taste of his sex.As he made no answer to her tirade, she continued after a moment more
calmly."It seems to me highly improbable that Anita has been murdered; so I
want you to engage a decent private detective who will work only for us.We must find her before the police do so.I take it for granted that you
will help me in this matter and that you are anxious--although,
naturally, not as anxious as I am--to prevent your cousin's widow from
being arrested.""A woman who has been treated by her husband as Arthur seems to have
treated Anita, is entitled to every consideration that her husband's
family can offer her," replied Cyril."I am already employing a
detective and if he finds Anita I will communicate with you at once."Now remember that my granddaughter is perfectly sane; on the
other hand, I think it advisable to keep this fact a secret for the
present.Circumstantial evidence is so strongly against her that we may
have to resort to the plea of insanity to save her neck.That girl has
been a thorn in my flesh since the day she was born; but she shall not
be hanged, if I can help it," said Lady Upton, shutting her mouth with
an audible click.CHAPTER IX

THE JEWELS


As soon as the funeral was over, Cyril left Geralton.On arriving in
London he recognised several reporters at the station.Fearing that they
might follow him, he ordered his taxi to drive to the Carlton.There he
got out and walking quickly through the hotel, he made his exit by a
rear door.Having assured himself that he was not being observed, he
hailed another taxi and drove to the nursing home.Thompkins," exclaimed the doctor, with ponderous
facetiousness."I am glad to be able to tell you that Mrs.She does not yet remember people or incidents, but she
is beginning to recall certain places.For instance, I asked her
yesterday if she had been to Paris.It suggested nothing to her, but
this morning she told me with great pride that Paris was a city and that
it had a wide street with an arch at one end.So you see she is
progressing; only we must not hurry her."Cyril murmured a vague assent."Of course," continued the doctor, "you must be very careful when you
see Lady Wilmersley to restrain your emotions, and on no account to
remind her of the immediate past.I hope and believe she will never
remember it.On the other hand, I wish you to talk about those of her
friends and relations for whom she has shown a predilection.Her memory
must be gently stimulated, but on no account excited.Quiet, quiet is
essential to her recovery.""But doctor--I must--it's frightfully important that my wife (he found
himself calling her so quite glibly) should be told of a certain fact at
once.If I wait even a day, it will be too late," urged Cyril."And you have reason to suppose that this communication will agitate
Lady Wilmersley?"You don't seem to realise the
delicate condition of her brain.Why, it might be fatal," insisted the
doctor.Cyril felt as if Nemesis were indeed overtaking him."Come, we will go to her," said the doctor, moving towards the door."She is naturally a little nervous about seeing you, so we must not keep
her waiting."If he could not undeceive the poor girl, how could
he enter her presence.To pose as the husband of a woman so as to enable
her to escape arrest was excusable, but to impose himself on the
credulity of an afflicted girl was absolutely revolting.If he treated
her with even the most decorous show of affection, he would be taking a
dastardly advantage of the situation.Yet if he behaved with too much
reserve, she would conclude that her husband was a heartless brute.The one person she had to cling to in the isolation to which
she had awakened.Oh, why had he ever placed her in
such an impossible position?He was
sure that she could easily have proved her innocence of whatever it was
of which she was accused, and in a few days at the latest would have
gone free without a stain on her character, while now, unless by some
miracle this episode remained concealed, she was irredeemably
compromised.He was a married man; she, for aught he knew to the
contrary, might also be bound, or at all events have a fiance or lover
waiting to claim her.Every minute the
chances that her secret could be kept decreased.If she did not return
to her friends while it was still possible to explain or account for the
time of her absence, he feared she would never be able to return at all.Yes, it would take a miracle to save her now!The doctor's tone was peremptory and his piercing eyes
were fixed searchingly upon him.What excuse could he give for refusing
to meet his supposed wife?"I must remind you, doctor," he faltered at last, "that my wife has
lately detested me.I--I really don't think I had better see her--I--I
am so afraid my presence will send her off her head again."The doctor's upper lip grew rigid and his eyes contracted angrily."I have already assured you that she is perfectly sane.It is essential
to her recovery that she should see somebody connected with her past
life.I cannot understand your reluctance to meet Lady Wilmersley.""I--I am only thinking of the patient," Cyril murmured feebly."The patient is my affair," snapped the doctor.For an instant he was again tempted to tell
Stuart-Smith the truth.And after all, he
reflected, if he had an opportunity of watching the girl, she might
quite unconsciously by some act, word, or even by some subtle essence of
her personality furnish him with a clue to her past.Every occupation
leaves indelible marks, although it sometimes takes keen eyes to discern
them.If the girl had been a seamstress, Cyril believed that he would be
able by observing her closely to assure himself of the fact."If you are willing to assume the
responsibility, I will go to my wife at once.But I insist on your being
present at our meeting.""Certainly, if you wish it, but it is not at all necessary, I assure
you," replied the doctor.A moment later Cyril, blushing like a schoolgirl, found himself in a
large, white-washed room.Before him on a narrow, iron bedstead lay his
mysterious _protegee_.He had forgotten how
beautiful she was.Her red lips were slightly parted and the colour
ebbed and flowed in her transparent cheeks.Ignoring the doctor, her
eager glance sought Cyril and for a minute the two young people gazed at
each other in silence.How could any
one doubt the candour of those star like eyes, thought Cyril.Crichton," exclaimed Stuart-Smith, "I have brought you the
husband you have been so undutiful as to forget.'Love, honour, and
obey, and above all remember,' I suggest as an amendment to the marriage
vow.""Nurse has been reading me the marriage service," said the girl, with a
quaint mixture of pride and diffidence."I know all about it now; I
don't think I'll forget again."And now that you have seen your husband, do you find
that you remember him at all?"I know that I have seen you before," she answered,
addressing Cyril."I gather from your manner that you don't exactly dislike him, do you?"asked the doctor with an attempt at levity."Your husband is so modest
that he is afraid to remain in your presence till you have reassured him
on this point.""I love him very much," was her astounding answer.She
certainly showed no trace of embarrassment, and although her eyes clung
persistently to his, their expression of childlike simplicity was
absolutely disarming."Very good, very good, quite as it should be," exclaimed the doctor,
evidently a little abashed by the frankness of the girl's reply."That
being the case, I will leave you two together to talk over old times,
although they can't be very remote.I am sure, however, that when I see
you again, you will be as full of reminiscences as an octogenarian,"
chuckled the doctor as he left the room.An arm-chair had been placed near the bed, obviously for his reception,
and after a moment's hesitation he took it.The girl did not speak, but
continued to look at him unflinchingly.Cyril fancied she regarded him
with something of the unquestioning reverence a small child might have
for a beloved parent.Never had he felt so
unworthy, so positively guilty.He racked his brains for something to
say, but the doctor's restrictions seemed to bar every topic which
suggested itself to him.In the dim light of the shaded lamp he had not noticed that
what he had supposed was her hair, was in reality a piece of black lace
bound turbanwise about her head."What are you wearing that bandage for?""Was your
head hurt--my dear?""No--I--I hope you won't be angry--nurse said you would--but I couldn't
help it.She hung her head as a naughty child might have done.Strange that her first act had been to destroy one of the few things by
which she could be identified.Had
she fooled them all, even the doctor?This amnesia, or whatever it was
called, was it real, was it assumed?"Oh, husband, I know it was wrong; but when I woke up and couldn't
remember anything, I was so frightened, and then nurse brought me a
looking-glass and the face I saw was so strange!Oh, it was so lonely
without even myself!She said it
sometimes happened when people have had a great shock or been very ill
and so--I made her cut it off.She didn't want to--it wasn't her
fault--I made her do it.""It had turned quite white, most of it."I am sure you would not have liked it."Cyril, looking into her limpid eyes, felt his sudden suspicions unworthy
of him."You must grow a nice new crop of black curls, if you want to appease
me," he answered."I know it was--but I hate it!At all events, as long as I must wear a
wig, I should like to have a nice yellow one; nurse tells me I can get
them quite easily."But I don't think a wig nice at all."But she mustn't cry--anything
rather than that."My dear, if you want a wig, you shall have one immediately.Tell your
nurse to send to the nearest hairdresser for an assortment from which
you can make your choice.""Oh, thank you, thank you," she cried, clapping her hands.Cyril had forgotten them for the moment, and it was through them that he
had hoped to establish her identity.No
ring encircled the wedding finger, nor did it show the depression which
the constant wearing of one invariably leaves.Those long, slender, well-kept hands certainly did not look
as if they could belong to a servant, but he reflected that a
seamstress' work was not of a nature to spoil them.Only the forefinger
of her left hand would probably bear traces of needle pricks."At your hands, my dear," he tried to speak lightly.Yes, it was as he had expected--her forefinger was rough.Everything had fore-warned him of this conclusion,
yet in his heart of hearts he had not believed it possible till this
moment.she asked, as she regarded them with anxious
scrutiny, evidently trying to discover why they failed to find favour in
the sight of her lord."They are--" He checked himself; he had almost added--the prettiest
hands in the world; but he mustn't say such things to her, not under the
circumstances."They are very pretty, only you have sewn so much that
you have quite spoiled one little finger."Further proof of her identity, if he needed it."Well, you must get nurse to find you something on which to exercise
your talents--only you must be careful not to prick yourself so much in
future.""I will try, husband," she answered meekly, as she gazed solemnly at the
offending finger."Do tell me something about my past life," said she."I have been lying
here wondering and wondering."In the first place, are my parents living?Cyril had no idea whether her parents were alive or
not, but even if they were, it would be impossible to communicate with
them for the present, so he had better set her mind at rest by denying
their existence."No, my dear, you are an orphan, and you have neither brothers nor
sisters," he added hastily.It was just as well to put a final stop to
questions as to her family."Nobody," he reiterated, but he felt like a brute."No, no, certainly not," he was so embarrassed that he spoke quite
sharply.She stared at him in amazement and to his disgust
Cyril felt himself turning crimson."Now I'm sorry," she continued with a soft sigh."I--I like them, too," he hastened to assure her.Really this was worse
than he had expected."I have been married four years," he truthfully answered, hoping that
that statement would satisfy her.Isn't it awful that
I can only remember you the very weeist little bit!But I will love,
honour, and obey you--now that I know--I will indeed.""I am sure you will always do what is right," said Cyril with a sudden
tightening of his throat.She looked so young, so innocent, so serious.Oh, if only----

"Bah, don't waste too much love on me.I'm an unworthy beggar," he said
aloud.She opened her eyes wide and stared
at him in consternation."But it doesn't say anything in the prayer-book
about not loving unworthy husbands.I don't believe it makes any
difference to the vow before God.Besides you don't look unworthy--are
you sure you are?"Cyril's eyes fell before her agonised gaze."I'll try to be worthy of you," he stammered."I'm too silly and
stupid now to be anything but a burden--I quite realise that--but the
doctor thinks I will get better and in the meantime I will try to please
you and do my duty."Poor baby, thought Cyril, the marriage vows she imagined she had taken
seemed to weigh dreadfully on her conscience.Oh, if he could only
undeceive her!Thompkins has talked enough for the present,"
she said.Cyril rose with a curious mixture of relief and reluctance."Well, this must be good-bye for to-day," he said, taking her small hand
in his.She lifted up her face--simply as a child might have done.Slowly he
leaned nearer to her, his heart was pounding furiously; the blood rushed
to his temples.For a moment he crushed her fingers to his lips; then turning abruptly,
he strode towards the door."You'll come to-morrow, won't you?""Yes, to-morrow," he answered.I will be so lonely without you," she called after
him, but he resolutely closed the door.At the foot of the stairs a nurse was waiting for him."The doctor would like to speak to you for a moment," she said as she
led the way to the consulting-room."Well, how did you find Lady Wilmersley's memory; were you able to help
her in any way to recall the past," inquired the doctor.Cyril was too preoccupied to notice that the other's manner was several
degrees colder than it had been on his arrival.Cyril felt guiltily conscious that he was prevaricating.But it
will come back to her--I am sure it will.""I say, doctor, how long do you think my wife will have to remain here?"She could be moved to-morrow, if
necessary, but I advise waiting till the day after.""You are sure it won't hurt her?"In fact, the sooner Lady Wilmersley resumes her normal life the
better.""How soon will I be able to talk freely to her?""That depends largely on how she progresses, but not before a month at
the earliest.By the way, Lord Wilmersley, I want you to take charge of
Lady Wilmersley's bag.The contents were too valuable to be left about;
so after taking out her toilet articles, the nurse brought it to me.""Lady Wilmersley's jewels, of course."If they were those belonging to his cousin,
their description had been published in every paper in the kingdom.It
was a miracle that Smith had not recognised them."Of course," Cyril managed to stammer.The doctor went to a safe and taking out a cheap, black bag handed it to
Cyril."I should like you, please, to see if they are all there," he said."That isn't the least necessary," Cyril hastened to assure him."You would greatly oblige me by doing so.""I'm quite sure they are all right; besides if any are missing, they
were probably stolen in Paris," said Cyril.Stuart-Smith was nothing if not persistent.His keen
eyes had noted Cyril's agitation and his reluctance to open the bag made
the doctor all the more determined to force him to do so.Seizing the bag, he made for the door."I'll come back to-morrow," he cried over his shoulder, as he hurried
unceremoniously out of the room and out of the house.A disreputable-looking man stood at the door of his waiting taxi and
obsequiously opened it.Shouting his address to the driver, Cyril flung
himself into the car and waved the beggar impatiently away.No sooner were they in motion than Cyril hastened to open the bag.A
brown paper parcel lay at the bottom of it.He undid the string with
trembling fingers.Yes, it was as he feared--a part, if not all, of the
Wilmersley jewels lay before him."Give me a penny, for the love of Gawd," begged a hoarse voice at his
elbow.The beggar was still clinging to the step and his villainous face
was within a foot of the jewels.Cyril felt himself grow cold with apprehension.The fellow knew who he
was, and followed him."A gen'lman like you could well spare a poor man a penny," the fellow
whined, but there was a note of menace in his voice.Cyril tried to get
a good look at him, but the light was too dim for him to distinguish his
features clearly.Hastily covering the jewels, Cyril thrust a coin into the grimy hand.he commanded, "go, or I'll call the police.""My poor little girl, my poor little girl," murmured Cyril
disconsolately, as he glanced once more at the incriminating jewels.CHAPTER X

THE TWO FRENCHMEN


"You must be mad, Cyril!No sane man could have got into such a mess!"cried Guy Campbell, excitedly pounding his fat knee with his podgy hand.Cyril had been so disturbed by the finding of the Wilmersley jewels that
he had at last decided that he must confide his troubles to some one.He
realised that the time had come when he needed not only advice but
assistance.He was now so convinced that he was being watched that he
had fled to his club for safety.There, at all events, he felt
comparatively safe from prying eyes, and it was there in a secluded
corner that he poured his tale of woe into his friend's astonished ears."You must be mad," the latter repeated."If that is all you can find to say, I am sorry I told you," exclaimed
Cyril irritably."It's a jolly good thing you did!Why, you are no more fit to take care
of yourself than a new-born baby."Guy's chubby face expressed such
genuine concern that Cyril relaxed a little."Perhaps I've been a bit of an ass, but really I don't see what else I
could have done.""No, don't suppose you do," said Guy, regarding Cyril with pitying
admiration.The question now is not what I ought to have done,
but what am I to do now?"Why, you wouldn't even listen to a sensible
suggestion.""To get the girl out of the nursing home and lose her.And it ought to
be done P. D. Q., as the Americans say.""I shall certainly do nothing of the sort.""I know you, Lord Quixote; you
have some crazy plan in your head."I haven't a plan, I tell you.Now as I am being followed----"

"I can't believe you are," interrupted Guy."I feel sure that that beggar I told you about was a detective.""He was evidently waiting for me and I couldn't shake him off till he
had had a good look at the jewels.""It is much more likely that he was waiting for a penny than for you,
and beggars are usually persistent.I see no possible reason why the
police should be shadowing you.It is your guilty conscience that makes
you so suspicious.""You may be right; I certainly hope you are, but till I am sure of it, I
don't dare to run the risk of being seen with Miss Prentice.As she is
in no condition to go about alone, I have been worrying a good deal as
to how to get her out of the Home; so I thought--it occurred to
me--that--you are the person to do it."So you leave me the pleasant task of running off with
a servant-girl who is 'wanted' by the police!"Miss Prentice is a lady," Cyril angrily asserted."H'm," Campbell ejaculated skeptically."That she is a beauty I do not
doubt, and she has certainly played her cards very skilfully.""Don't you dare to speak of her like that," cried Cyril, clenching his
fists and half starting to his feet.You're smitten with her," exclaimed Campbell, staring
aghast at his friend.Cyril flushed darkly under his tan."Certainly not, but I have the greatest respect for this unfortunate
young woman, and don't you forget it again."Believe what you like, but I didn't think you were the
sort of man who never credits a fellow with disinterested motives, if he
behaves half-way decently to a woman."You mustn't take offence so
easily.I have never seen the young lady, remember.And you know I will
help you even against my better judgment."Now let us first of all consider Miss Prentice's case
dispassionately.I want to be sure of my facts; then I may be able to
form some conjecture as to why Wilmersley was murdered and how the
jewels came into Miss Prentice's possession.You tell me that it has
been proved that she really left Geralton on the afternoon before the
murder?""Yes; the carrier swears he drove her into Newhaven and put her down
near the station.Further than that they have luckily not been able to
trace her.""Now your idea is that Miss Prentice, having in some way managed to
secure a car, returned to Geralton that evening and got into the castle
through the library window?""No, I doubt if she entered the castle.I can think of no reason why she
should have done so," said Cyril."In that case, how do you account for her injuries?Who could have
flogged her except your charming cousin?""Granting that she is Priscilla Prentice, the only hypothesis I can
think of which explains her predicament is this: Having planned to
rescue her mistress, she was only waiting for a favourable opportunity
to present itself.The doctor's visit determined her to act at once.I
agree with you that to re-enter Geralton was not her original intention,
but while waiting under the library window for Lady Wilmersley to join
her, she hears Wilmersley ill-treating his wife, so she climbs in and
rushes to the latter's assistance.""Yes, yes," assented Cyril with shining eyes."But she is overpowered by Wilmersley," continued Campbell, warming to
his theme, "who, insane with rage, flogs her unmercifully.Then Lady
Wilmersley, fearing the girl will be killed, seizes the pistol, which is
lying on the desk, and fires at her husband----"

"I am convinced that that is just what happened," cried Cyril."Don't be too sure of it; still, it seems to me that that theory hangs
together pretty well," Campbell complacently agreed."Of course, neither
woman contemplated murder.Wilmersley's death completely unnerved them.If the gardener's wife heard a cry coming from the car, it is possible
that one or the other had an attack of hysterics.Now about the
jewels--I believe Miss Prentice took charge of them, either because Lady
Wilmersley was unfit to assume such a responsibility or because they
agreed that she could the more easily dispose of them.I think that Miss
Prentice's hurried trip to town was undertaken not in order to avoid
arrest, but primarily to raise money, of which they must have had great
need, and possibly also to rejoin her mistress, who, now that we know
that she made her escape in a car, is probably hiding somewhere either
in London itself or in its vicinity."You have thought of everything," cried Cyril
admiringly."Of course, I may be quite wrong.These are only suppositions,
remember," Campbell modestly reminded him."By the way, what have you
done with the jewels?I can't believe that you are in any danger of
arrest, but if there is the remotest chance of such a thing, it wouldn't
look very well if they were found in your possession."I was even afraid that my rooms might be
searched in my absence, so I took them with me."I have hidden the bag and to-night I mean to burn
it.""Your pocket is not a very safe repository."That is why I want you to take charge of them," said Cyril."Oh, very well," sighed Campbell, with mock resignation."In for a
penny, in for a pound.I shall probably end by being arrested as a
receiver of stolen property!But now we must consider what we had better
do with Miss Prentice.""I think I shall hire a cottage in the country for her.""If you did that, the police would find her immediately.The only safe
hiding-place is a crowd."Now let me see: Where is she least likely to attract
attention?It must be a place where you could manage to see her without
being compromised, and, if possible, without being observed.In a huge caravansary like
that all sorts and conditions of people jostle each other without
exciting comment.Besides, the police are less likely to look among the
guests of such an expensive hotel for a poor maid servant or in such a
public resort for a fugitive from justice.""But in her present condition," continued Campbell, "I don't see how she
could remain there alone."But what trustworthy woman could you get to undertake such a
task?Perhaps one of the nurses----"

"No," Cyril hastily interrupted him."When she leaves the nursing home,
all trace of her must be lost.At any moment the police may discover
that a woman whom I have represented to be my wife has been a patient
there.That will naturally arouse their suspicions and they will do
their utmost to discover who it is that I am protecting with my name.For one thing, she would feel called upon to
report to the doctor.""You might bribe her not to do so," suggested Guy."I shouldn't dare to trust to an absolutely unknown quantity.Oh, if I
only knew a respectable woman on whom I could rely!I would pay her a
small fortune for her services.""I know somebody who might do," said Campbell."Her name is Miss Trevor
and she used to be my sister's governess.She is too old to teach now
and I fancy has a hard time to make both ends meet.The only trouble is
that she is so conscientious that she would rather starve than be mixed
up in anything she did not consider perfectly honourable and above
board.If I told her that she was to chaperon a young lady whom the
police were looking for, she would be so indignant that I doubt if she
would ever speak to me again.""It doesn't seem decent to inveigle her by false representations into
taking a position which she would never dream of accepting if she knew
the truth.""I will pay her L200 a year as long as she lives, if she will look after
Miss Prentice till this trouble is over.Even if the worst happens and
the girl is discovered, she can truthfully plead ignorance of the
latter's identity," urged Cyril."True, and two hundred a year is good pay even for unpleasant notoriety.Yes, on the whole I think I am justified in accepting the offer for her.But now we must consider what fairy tale we are going to concoct for her
benefit.""Oh, I don't know," sighed Cyril wearily."Imagination giving out, or conscience awakening--which is it?""Sorry, old man; but joking aside, we must really decide what we are to
tell Miss Trevor.You can no longer pose as Miss Prentice's husband----"

"Why not?""What possible excuse have you for doing so, now that she is to leave
the doctor's care?""I am sure it would have a very bad effect on Miss Prentice's health, if
I were to tell her that she is not my wife.""Remember, she is completely cut off from the past," urged Cyril; "she
has neither friend nor relation to cling to.I am the one person in the
world she believes she has a claim on.Besides,
the doctor's orders are that she shall not be in any way agitated."Now what explanation will you give
Miss Trevor for not living with your wife?""I shall say that her state of health renders it inadvisable for the
present.""I think we had better stick to Thompkins.Only we will spell it Tomkyns and change the Christian name to John.""But won't she confide what she believes to be her real name to Miss
Trevor?""I think not--not if I tell her I don't wish her to do so.She has a
great idea of wifely obedience, I assure you.""Well," laughed Guy, "that is a virtue which so few real wives possess
that it seems a pity it should be wasted on a temporary one.And now,
Cyril, we must decide on the best way and the best time for transferring
Miss Prentice to the hotel.""Unless something unexpected occurs to change our plans, I think she had
better be moved the day after to-morrow.I advise your starting as early
as possible before the world is well awake.Only be sure you
are not followed, that is all I ask.""I don't expect we shall be, but if we are, I think I can promise to
outwit them," Campbell assured him."I shall never forget what you are doing for me, Guy."I expect you to erect a monument commemorating my
virtues and my folly.Where are those stolen goods of
which I am to become the custodian?"I have done them up in several parcels, so that they are
not too bulky to carry.As I don't want the police to know how intimate
we are, it is better that we should not be seen together in public for
the present.""I think you are over-cautious.But perhaps," agreed Campbell, "we might
as well meet here till all danger is over."A few minutes later Cyril also left the club.His talk with Campbell had
been a great relief to him.As he walked briskly along, he felt
calm--almost cheerful.Turning quickly Cyril recognised Inspector Griggs.For a moment Cyril was too startled to speak.Then, pulling himself
together, he exclaimed with an attempt at heartiness:

"Why, Inspector!"I only left Newhaven this afternoon, but I think my work there is
finished--for the present at least.""No indeed, but the clue now leads away from Geralton."Cyril found it difficult to control the tremor in his
voice."If you'll excuse me, my lord, I had better keep my suppositions to
myself till I am able to verify them."Cyril felt he
could not let him go before he had ascertained exactly what he had to
fear.It was so awful, this fighting in the dark."If you have half an hour to spare, come to my rooms.Cyril was convinced that the Inspector knew where he
was staying and had been lying in wait for him.He thought it best to
pretend that he felt above suspicion.A few minutes later they were sitting before a blazing fire, the
Inspector puffing luxuriously at a cigar and sipping from time to time a
glass of whiskey and soda which Peter had reluctantly placed at his
elbow.Peter, as he himself would have put it, "did not hold with the
police," and thought his master was sadly demeaning himself by
fraternising with a member of that calling."I quite understand your reluctance to talk about a case," said Cyril,
reverting at once to the subject he had in mind; "but as this one so
nearly concerns my family and consequently myself, I think I have a
right to your confidence.I am most anxious to know what you have
discovered.I assure you, you can rely
on my discretion.""Well, my lord, it's a bit unprofessional, but seeing it's you, I don't
mind if I do.It's the newspaper men, I am afraid of.""I shall not mention what you tell me to any one except possibly to one
friend," Cyril hastily assured him.You see I may be all wrong, so I don't want to say
too much till I can prove my case.""I understand that," said Cyril; "and this clue that you are
following--what is it?""The car, my lord," answered the Inspector, settling himself deeper in
his chair, while his eyes began to gleam with suppressed excitement."You have found the car in which her ladyship made her escape?""I don't know about that yet, but I have found the car that stood at the
foot of the long lane on the night of the murder.""Oh, that's not so very wonderful," protested the Inspector with an
attempt at modesty, but he was evidently bursting with pride in his
achievement.asked Cyril with genuine
amazement."I began my search by trying to find out what cars had been seen in the
neighbourhood of Geralton on the night of the murder--by neighbourhood I
mean a radius of twenty-five miles.I found, as I expected, that
half-past eleven not being a favourite hour for motoring, comparatively
few had been seen or heard.Most of these turned out to be the property
of gentlemen who had no difficulty in proving that they had been used
only for perfectly legitimate purposes.There remained, however, two
cars of which I failed to get a satisfactory account.Benedict, a young man who owns a place about ten miles from
Geralton, and who seems to have spent the evening motoring wildly over
the country.He pretends he had no particular object, and as he is a bit
queer, it may be true.The other car is the property of the landlord of
the Red Lion Inn, a very respectable hotel in Newhaven.I then sent two
of my men to examine these cars and report if either of them has a new
tire, for the gardener's wife swore that the car she heard had burst
one.Benedict's tires all showed signs of wear, but the Red Lion car
has a brand new one!""Oh, that is nothing," replied the Inspector, vainly trying to suppress
a self-satisfied smile."Did you find any further evidence against this hotel-keeper?"He knew Lord Wilmersley slightly, but says he has never even seen her
Ladyship."In that case what part does he play in the affair?"You see he keeps the car for the convenience of his
guests and on the day in question it had been hired by two young
Frenchmen, who were out in it from two o'clock till midnight."But how could they have had anything to do with the
tragedy?"So far all I have been able to find out about
these two men is that they landed in Newhaven ten days before the
murder.They professed to be brothers and called themselves Joseph and
Paul Durand.They seemed to be amply provided with money and wanted the
best the hotel had to offer.Joseph Durand appeared a decent sort of
fellow, but the younger one drank.The waiters fancy that the elder man
used to remonstrate with him occasionally, but the youngster paid very
little attention to him.""You say they _professed_ to be brothers."For one reason, the elder one did not understand a word of English,
while the young one spoke it quite easily, although with a strong
accent.That is, he spoke it with a strong accent when he was sober, but
when under the influence of liquor this accent disappeared.""They left Newhaven the morning after the murder.Their departure was
very hurried, and the landlord is sure that the day before they had no
intention of leaving.""Have you been able to trace them farther?""Not yet, my lord, but I have sent one of my men to try and follow them
up, and I have notified the continental police to be on the look-out for
them.It's a pity that they have three days' start of us.""But as you have an accurate description of both, I should imagine that
they will soon be found.""It's through the young 'un they'll be caught, if they are caught.""Why, is he deformed in any way?""No, my lord, but they tell me he is abnormally small for a man of his
age, for he must be twenty-two or three at the very least.The landlord
believes that he is a jockey who had got into bad habits, and that the
elder man is his trainer or backer.Of course, he may be right, but the
waiters pooh-pooh the idea.They insist that the boy is a gentleman-born
and servants are pretty good judges of such things, though you mightn't
think it, my lord.""I can quite believe it," assented Cyril."But then there are many
gentlemen jockeys."I only wish I had seen the little fellow, for they all
agree that there was something about him which would make it impossible
for any one who had once met him ever to forget him again."They also tell me that if his eyes had not been so
bloodshot, and if he had not looked so drawn and haggard, he'd have been
an extraordinarily good-looking chap."It seems that he has large blue eyes, a fine little nose, not a
bit red as you would expect, and as pretty a mouth as ever you'd see.His hair is auburn and he wears it rather long, which I don't think he'd
do if he were a jockey.Besides, his skin is as fine as a baby's, though
its colour is a grey-white with only a spot of red in the middle of each
cheek.""He must be a queer-looking beggar!"That's why I think we shall soon spot him.""What did the elder Durand look like?"He is about twenty-eight years old,
medium height, and inclined to be stout.He has dark hair, a little thin
at the temples, dark moustache, and dark eyes."On the night of the murder you say they returned to the hotel at about
midnight?""The porter was so sleepy that he can't remember much about it.He had
an impression that they came in arm in arm and went quietly upstairs.""But what do you think they had done with Lady Wilmersley?""But, my lord, you didn't expect that they would bring her to the hotel,
did you?If they were her friends, their first care would be for her
safety.If they were not--well, we will have to look for another victim,
that is all.""I mustn't
keep you any longer."He hesitated a moment, eyeing Cyril doubtfully.There was evidently still something he wished to say.Cyril had also risen to his feet and stood leaning against the
mantelpiece, idly wondering at the man's embarrassment."I trust her Ladyship has quite recovered?"CHAPTER XI

THE INSPECTOR INTERVIEWS CYRIL


Cyril felt the muscles of his face stiffen.He had for days been
dreading some such question, yet now that it had finally come, it had
found him completely unprepared.He must
fight for her till the last ditch.But how devilishly clever of Griggs to have deferred his attack until he
was able to catch his adversary off his guard!Cyril looked keenly but,
he hoped, calmly at the Inspector.Their eyes met, but without the clash
which Cyril had expected.The man's expression, although searching, was
not hostile; in fact, there was something almost apologetic about his
whole attitude.Griggs was not sure of his ground, that much was
obvious.He knew something, he probably suspected more, but there was
still a chance that he might be led away from the trail.Cyril's mind worked with feverish rapidity.He realised that it was
imperative that his manner should appear perfectly natural.He must first decide what his position,
viewed from Griggs's standpoint, really was.He must have a definite
conception of his part before he attempted to act it.The Inspector evidently knew that a young woman, who bore Cyril's name,
had been taken ill on the Newhaven train.He was no doubt also aware
that she was now under the care of Dr.But if the
Inspector really believed the girl to be his wife, these facts were in
no way incriminating.He must, therefore, know
more of the truth.No, for if he had discovered that the girl was not
Lady Wilmersley, Cyril was sure that Griggs would not have broached the
subject so tentatively.He had told every one who inquired about his wife that she
was still on the continent.Peter, also, obeying his orders, had
repeated the same story in the servants' hall.And, of course, Griggs
knew that they were both lying.I
have not mentioned it to any one."Cyril flattered himself that his
voice had exactly the right note of slightly displeased surprise.Yes,
for Griggs's expression relaxed and he answered with a smile that was
almost deprecating:

"I, of course, saw the report of the man who searched the train, and I
was naturally surprised to find that the only lady who had taken her
ticket in Newhaven was Mrs.In a case like this we have
to verify everything, so when I discovered that the gentleman who was
with her, was undoubtedly your Lordship, it puzzled me a good deal why
both you and your valet should be so anxious to keep her Ladyship's
presence in England a secret.""Yes, yes, it must have astonished you, and I confess I am very sorry
you found me out," said Cyril.The old lie must be
told once more."Her Ladyship is suffering from a--a nervous affection.""In fact--she has just left an insane asylum,"
he finally blurted out."You mean that the present Lady Wilmersley--not the Dowager--?"The
Inspector was too surprised to finish his sentence."Yes, it's queer, isn't it, that both should be afflicted in the same
way," agreed Cyril, calmly lighting a cigarette."Most remarkable," ejaculated Griggs, staring fixedly at Cyril."As the doctors believe that her Ladyship will completely recover, I
didn't want any one to know that she had ever been unbalanced.But I
might have known that it was bound to leak out.""We are no gossips, my lord; I shall not mention what you have told me
to any one.""They have got too much to do, to bother about what doesn't concern
them.I don't believe a dozen of them noticed that in searching the
train for one Lady Wilmersley, they had inadvertently stumbled on
another, and as the latter had nothing to do with their case, they
probably dismissed the whole thing from their minds."Well, you see, it's different with me.It's the business of my men to
bring me isolated facts, but I have to take a larger view of
the--the--the--ah--possibilities.I have got to think of
everything--suspect every one.""Your Lordship would have no difficulty in proving an alibi.""So you took the trouble to find that out?"I should really like to know what could have led you to
suspect me?""I didn't suspect you, my lord.You see, Lady
Wilmersley must have had an accomplice and you must acknowledge that it
was a strange coincidence that your Lordship should have happened to
pass through Newhaven at that particular moment, especially as the
Newhaven route is not very popular with people of your means."As a matter of fact, I had no intention of taking it, but I
missed the Calais train.""I see," Griggs nodded his head as if the explanation fully satisfied
him."Would you mind, my lord," he continued after a brief pause, "if,
now that we are on the subject, I asked you a few questions?There are
several points which are bothering me.Of course, don't answer, if you
had rather not.""You mean if my answers are likely to incriminate me.Well, I don't
think they will, so fire ahead," drawled Cyril, trying to express by his
manner a slight weariness of the topic.Griggs looked a trifle abashed, but he persisted."I have been wondering how it was that you met her Ladyship in Newhaven,
if you had no previous intention of taking that route?"The fact is, her Ladyship escaped from an
asylum near Fontainebleau over a fortnight ago.I scoured France for her
but finally gave up the search, and leaving the French detectives to
follow up any clue that might turn up, I decided almost on the spur of
the moment to run over to England.I was never more astonished than when
I found her on the train."She was rather excited and I asked no questions.""Had she ever before visited Newhaven to your knowledge?""Then she did not know the late Lord Wilmersley?"inquired the detective, looking keenly
at Cyril."I was never very friendly with my cousin, and we sailed for South
Africa immediately after our marriage.Neither of us has been home since
then.""I must find out where she spent the night of the murder," murmured the
Inspector.He seemed to have forgotten Cyril's presence."If you think her Ladyship had anything to do with the tragedy, I assure
you, you are on the wrong track," cried Cyril, forgetting for a moment
his pose of polite aloofness.It is
chiefly her memory that is affected.Until the last few days what she
did one minute, she forgot the next.""You think, therefore, that she would not be able to tell me how she
spent her time in Newhaven?"By the way, how has she taken the news of
Lord Wilmersley's murder?"She does not even know that he is dead.""I see I must explain her case more fully, so that you may be able to
understand my position.Her Ladyship's mind became affected about six
months ago, owing to causes into which I need not enter now.Since her
arrival in England her improvement has been very rapid.Her memory is
growing stronger, but it is essential that it should not be taxed for
the present.The doctor assures me that if she is kept perfectly quiet
for a month or so, she will recover completely.That is why I want her
to remain in absolute seclusion.An incautious word might send her off
her balance.She must be protected from people, and I will protect her,
I warn you of that.Six weeks from now, if all goes well, you can
cross-question her, if you still think it necessary, but at present I
not only forbid it, but I will do all in my power to prevent it.Of
course," continued Cyril more calmly, "I have neither the power nor the
desire to hamper you in the exercise of your profession; so if you doubt
my statements just ask Dr.Stuart-Smith whether he thinks her Ladyship
has ever been in a condition when she might have committed murder.He
will laugh at you, I am sure.""I don't doubt it, my lord; all the same--" Griggs hesitated."All the same you would like to know what her Ladyship did on the night
of the murder.I assure you that although
our motives differ, my curiosity equals yours."I shall certainly do my best to solve the riddle,"
said the Inspector as he bowed himself out.Cyril sank wearily into a chair.The interview had been a great strain,
and yet he felt that in a way it had been a relief also.He flattered
himself that he had played his cards rather adroitly.For now that he
had found out exactly how much the police knew, he might possibly
circumvent them.Of course, it was merely a question of days, perhaps
even of hours, before Griggs would discover that the girl was not his
wife; for the Inspector was nothing if not thorough and if he once began
searching Newhaven for evidence of her stay there, Cyril was sure that
it would not take him long to establish her identity.If he only had
Griggs fighting on his side, instead of the little pompous fool of a
Judson!By the way, what could have become of Judson?It was now two
full days since he had left Geralton.He certainly ought to have
reported himself long before this.Well, it made no difference one way
